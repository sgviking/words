I.\n\n    THE CONCLUSION OF THE DUCHESS OF ORLEANS\u2019 ADVOCATE AGAINST THE\n    DUKE OF BURGUNDY, AND THE REPLY FROM THE CHANCELLOR.\n\n\nThe chancellor of France, in the king\u2019s name, ordered the duchess\u2019s\nadvocate, master William Cousinot, to draw up such conclusions as\nshould be satisfactory to the duchess and her son, the duke of Orleans.\nThe advocate, after many excuses, began by showing how pitiable their\nstate was, and took for his theme part of the 7th chapter of the gospel\nof St Luke, \u2018H\u00e6c vidua erat quam cum vidisset Dominus misericordia\nmotus est super eam.\u2019\n\n\u2018Most noble prince, when our Lord entered a city called Nain, he met\nthe corpse of a young man, which his friends were carrying to the\ngrave; and when he noticed that the mother of the young man was a\nwidow, he was on this account moved with compassion toward her, and\nrestored her son to life. I may most truly apply these words to my\nlady of Orleans, for she is a widow who bewails the death of her lord\nand husband, and our lord will have compassion on her; for the king\nis our lord, in respect of terrestrial jurisdiction; and not only the\nking, but thou, lord of Acquitaine, and all other princes of this world\nhaving territorial powers, seeing my lady of Orleans thus disconsolate,\nought to feel compassion for her, and give her aid and support in\nprocuring strict justice to be done for the cruel death of her husband.\n\n\u2018In every case, and at all times, full justice should be administered\nto all; for, according to the words of the Psalmist, it is a good and\nmeritorious act,--\u2018Beati qui custodiunt judicium et faciunt justitiam\nin omni tempore.\u2019 Psalm cv.\n\n\u2018But justice should always be more rigorously observed in regard\nto widows and orphans, who have been deprived of their fathers or\nhusbands, than in any other case; for the divine, canon and civil\nlaws urge the necessity of succouring the widow and orphan. We have\nthe first instance of this in the 22d chapter of Jeremiah,--\u2018Facite\njudicium et justitiam, et liberate vi oppressum de manu calumniatoris,\npupillum et viduam,\u2019 &c.\n\n\u2018In regard to the canon law, the decrees declare, that it is very\nproper for kings to do justice and execute judgment, and deliver from\nthe hands of the oppressors widows and orphans who are injuriously used\nby them.\n\n\u2018As for the civil law, it is very clear, that widows and orphans are\nparticularly privileged in many cases, as may be seen in different law\nwritings.\n\n\u2018My lady of Orleans has lost her husband: her children have lost their\nfather, certainly one of the handsomest and most accomplished princes\nin Christendom. But let us see how they have lost him: had he been\ntaken from them by a natural death, their case would not have been so\nmuch to be pitied; but he is cut off violently in the flower of his\nyouth. In truth, this is such an outrage that every law and customary\nproceeding should bend in their favour against the malignant author of\nthe deed.\n\n\u2018In the first place, our king and sovereign lord is bounden\nparticularly by the commands of God, to whom he cannot be disobedient\nwithout sinning, to execute judgment, according to the words of\nJeremiah in the chapter before mentioned,--\u2018In memetipso juravi, dicit\nDominus, quia in solitudine erit domus vestra.\u2019 And this is conformable\nto the reply made by St Remy to king Clovis when he baptised him. The\nking asked him how long the kingdom of France would endure. The saint\nanswered, that it would last so long as justice should reign there. The\nconverse of which is, that when justice shall cease to be administered,\nthe kingdom will fall. To the king therefore may be applied what is\nwritten in the canon law, \u2018Quod justitia est illud quod suum firmat\nimperium.\u2019\n\n\u2018O, duke of Acquitaine! thou art he who, after the king, art bound\nto do justice according to the words of the Psalmist, \u2018Deus judicium\ntuum regi da et justitiam tuam filio regis.\u2019 Thou art the eldest son\nto the king, to whom, by the grace of God, thou wilt succeed, and be\nour lord: attend to our case for the love of God, for to thee more\nparticularly does it belong; and if thou dost not lay thy hand on it,\nwhen thou shalt come to reign, thou mayest find thy kingdom desolate\nand destroyed,--for each will in his turn seize parts of it, and be the\nmaster, should this atrocious crime remain unpunished.\n\n\u2018Ye also, my lords, princes, dukes and counts of the royal blood,\nrelations of the late duke, and ye other nobles, who have an affection\nfor the king\u2019s crown and honour, what ought to be your conduct on\nthis occasion? Why, certainly, if the king will not interfere in this\nmatter, ye ought to take up the business and execute judgment; for ye\nare bound by oath to guard and defend the king\u2019s honour against all who\nmay infringe upon it. This ye have done in former times, through God\u2019s\ngrace, and for which this kingdom has gained greater glory than any\nother realm in Christendom: insomuch that the English, the Germans, and\nother foreigners, have come hither to seek for justice.\n\n\u2018My lords, for the love of God, let your loyalty burst forth, according\nto your oaths, in behalf of my lady of Orleans, as she has the fullest\nconfidence it will; for, after God and the king, you are her only\nrefuge. Let no one fear to do justice, from the scandal or persecution\nthat may ensue, for it is a maxim of law, \u2018Utilius est scandalum nasci\nac permitti, quam ut veritas relinquatur,\u2019--although it were certain\nthe doing justice in this case would cause much grievous persecution\nto ensue. Yet for all this justice should not be neglected; for in\nthat case you would be indeed reproachable, if, through fear of the\noffender, you shall not dare to decree justice. On no occasion should\njustice be neglected: therefore, my lords, act according to what the\nprophet says, \u2018Viriliter agite, et confortetur cor vestrum et sustinete\nDominum.\u2019\n\n\u2018In truth, if ye do not act with courage, for one inconvenience that\nmay happen, by executing judgment, one hundred would ensue from default\nof justice. Therefore, my lords, do not hesitate to do justice to my\nlady of Orleans and her children from any dread of inconveniences\nthat may happen, but follow the dictates of our Lord,--\u2018Judicare\npupillo et humili ut non apponat magnificare se homo super terram.\u2019\nLet the punishment be so exemplary that none other may henceforth\ncommit so great or so disgraceful a crime, and that it may be held\nin perpetual memory and abhorrence. This is the object of my lady of\nOrleans and her children, namely, that the crime may be atoned for as\nheavily as possible in this world. In order that this atonement may\nbe made, my lady of Orleans and her children would willingly take the\nlegal steps for the infliction of capital punishment, if this could\nregularly be done; but as these steps, according to the customary\nusage of France, belong to the king\u2019s attorney-general alone, they\npropose that the offender shall be punished in manner following,--that\nis to say, by sentence of the king and of the court, be it ordered\nthat our adversary, the duke of Burgundy, be brought to the castle of\nthe Louvre, or elsewhere, according to the king\u2019s pleasure and that\nof my clients, and there, in the presence of the king, of my lord of\nAcquitaine, and the other princes of the blood, as well as of the\ncouncil and people, the duke of Burgundy, without hood or girdle,\nshall, on his knees, publicly confess, with a loud voice, before my\nlady of Orleans, her children, and as many other persons as she may\nplease, that maliciously and treacherously he has had my lord of\nOrleans assassinated, through hatred, envy and ambition, and for no\nother cause, notwithstanding all the charges made against him, and\nother imputations thrown on his character, to justify and exculpate\nhimself from so base a deed; and shall demand pardon from my lady of\nOrleans and her children, most humbly supplicating them to forgive his\noffences, declaring that he knows of nothing prejudicial to the honour\nand reputation of the said duke of Orleans deceased, and recals all he\nmay have said or published to the contrary.\n\n\u2018In this state he shall be carried to the court of the palace, and to\nthe h\u00f4tel de Saint Pol, the residence of the king, and to the spot\nwhere the murder was committed, and there, on high stages erected for\nthe purpose, he shall repeat the above words before such commissioners\nas my lady of Orleans and her son may please to appoint. He shall\nremain on his knees, at the last place, until priests nominated for\nthe purpose shall have recited the seven penitential psalms, said the\nlitany, and the other parts of the burial service, for the soul of the\ndeceased, after which he shall kiss the earth, and ask pardon of God,\nof my lady of Orleans, and of her children, for the offences he has\ncommitted against them.\n\n\u2018The manner and form of this recantation, and begging pardon, shall be\nwritten out, and copies sent to all the different towns in the kingdom\nwith orders for the magistrates to have them proclaimed by sound of\ntrumpet, that it may be notorious to all within and without the realm.\n\n\u2018And as additional reparations for such offences, and that they may\nremain in perpetual remembrance, all the houses belonging to the duke\nof Burgundy in Paris shall be razed to the ground, and remain in ruins\nfor ever. On the places where any of his houses shall have stood, there\nshall be erected handsome crosses of stone, having large and strong\ntablets, on which shall be written a full account of the murder of my\nlate lord, the duke of Orleans, and the cause of these houses being\ndestroyed.\n\n\u2018On the spot where my late lord was murdered shall be erected a similar\ncross; and the house wherein the murderers hid themselves shall be\npulled down. This spot, and the adjoining houses, the duke of Burgundy\nshall be forced to purchase, and to build thereon a handsome college\nfor six canons, six vicars, and six chaplains, whose nominations shall\nremain with my lady of Orleans and her heirs. In this college six\nmasses shall be said every day for the soul of the deceased duke of\nOrleans, and high mass at the usual time of canonical hours. For the\nsupport of this college there shall be a mortmain rent of one thousand\nlivres parisis; and the whole shall be well furnished with dresses,\nbooks, chalices, ornaments, and all other necessaries, at the sole\nexpense of the duke of Burgundy; and over the entrance shall be written\nin large letters the cause of its foundation.\n\n\u2018The duke of Burgundy shall, beside, be constrained to found a college\nfor the salvation of the soul of the deceased, in the town of Orleans,\nconsisting of twelve canons, twelve vicars, and twelve clerks, which\ncollege shall bear the name of the defunct; and the nominations to\nit shall belong to my lady of Orleans, and to the heirs of the late\nduke of Orleans. It shall be situated in whatever part of the late\nduke\u2019s possessions in Orleans the duchess shall please, and shall be\nhandsomely constructed, furnished with books and all other necessaries,\nwith an income of two thousand livres parisis; and a similar\ninscription to the one before mentioned shall be placed over the gate.\n\n\u2018For the greater perpetuity of this event, and that it may be made\nknown to all foreign nations, the duke of Burgundy shall be enjoined to\nerect two chapels; the one near the holy sepulchre at Jerusalem, and\nthe other at Rome, and assign to each the annual value of one hundred\nlivres in the coin of those countries, and to provide them with all\nnecessary furniture. In each of these chapels shall a daily mass be\nsaid for the soul of the deceased, and over the doors shall be placed\nthe same inscriptions as over the colleges.\n\n\u2018The duke of Burgundy shall also be constrained to pay the sum of\none million in gold, not to the profit of my lady of Orleans or her\nchildren, but to found and endow hospitals and monasteries, and to\ndistribute in alms and other works of piety for the salvation of the\nsoul of the defunct.\n\n\u2018That this sentence may be carried into due effect, all the lands\nwhich the duke of Burgundy possesses in this kingdom shall be placed\nin the hands of the king, that they may be sold for the accomplishment\nof the above works. The duke of Burgundy shall also be condemned to\nclose imprisonment in whatever place it may please the king, until\nthe above sentence be carried into execution. After which, he shall\nbe banished for ever beyond sea, or at least for the space of twenty\nyears, to bewail and repent of his crime, or until it shall be thought\nhe may have sufficiently done it. On his return, he shall be ordered,\nunder severe penalties, never to approach within one hundred leagues of\nthe queen or the children of the late duke of Orleans, without being\ncondemned to such heavy damages, and other penalties suited to the\nenormity of the case, as shall be held in perpetual remembrance. He\nshall also be condemned to pay whatever costs my lady of Orleans and\nher children may have occurred on this present occasion.\n\n\u2018I say, therefore, that such ought to be the judgment given for them,\nand without delay, considering the notoriety and enormity of the\noffence of our adversary; for it is publicly known, that the duke of\nBurgundy has confessed himself guilty of it. He first made a confession\nof his guilt to my lord of Berry and to the king of Sicily, giving no\nreason for it but that he was urged on by the devil: he then did the\nsame before several noblemen. This ought therefore to weigh against\nhim, and convict him of the crime, without further trial: nor ought\nyou to suffer any sort of colouring to be admitted in palliation of\nhis guilt. He ought not to be heard otherwise than he has been, for\nhe varied not in his confessions to the different persons; and pope\nInnocent approves of this, in his chapter on Free Will, and Guillermus\nde Montleon, in his chapter on Clerical Constitutions. Pope Nicholas\nheld king Lothaire, in like manner, convicted to his prejudice in a\ncertain case, about which he had written to the pope, as appears in\nthe above chapter. This confession of king Lothaire had been made in\na letter, previously to any trial. The duke of Burgundy, therefore,\nought to be condemned from this public confession of his crime in the\npresence of different persons. He has beside made a similar confession\nwhen he appeared publicly before thee, lord of Acquitaine, when thou\ndidst sit in judgment representing the person of the king, and before\nthe princes of the blood and all the council of state. He cannot,\ntherefore, deny his having made such confession before competent\njudges. It follows then, that no further trial is necessary, but that\nsentence should immediately be passed; for confession of guilt should\nbe judged the fullest evidence.\n\n\u2018The law says, \u2018In confitentem null\u00e6 sunt partes judicantis.\u2019 And\nsupposing, that according to some, a sentence is requisite, at least\nit is certain that no trial or examination of the cause is necessary,\nsince this present case is extremely notorious. So has it formerly been\ndetermined by the sentence and judgment of the kings in times past,\nagainst several great lords of their day,--to wit, that when the facts\nwere notorious, no other process or inquisition was required. And so\nshall it be determined, by the grace of God, in the present case,--for\nso reason demands.\n\n\u2018Should it, however, be thought necessary to go into another trial,\nwhich, from all I have said, I cannot suppose, my lady of Orleans\nis ready prepared to bring forward the fullest proof of what I have\nadvanced, and such as must convince all reasonable persons. But as my\nlady can now only offer civil conclusions, and would willingly propose\ncriminal ones, but that it belongs to the king\u2019s attorney-general\naccording to the usage in France,--my lady, therefore, most earnestly\nsupplicates the king\u2019s attorney to join with her, and propose such\nsentence as the law in this case requires.\u2019\n\nThese were the conclusions of my lady of Orleans and her sons,--after\nwhich, the council of the princes of the blood, and others of the\nking\u2019s council, with the approbation of the duke of Acquitaine, made\nthe chancellor reply to the duchess of Orleans, that the duke of\nAcquitaine, as lieutenant for the king, and representing his person,\nand the princes of the blood-royal were well satisfied with her\nconduct respecting her late lord the duke of Orleans: that they held\nhim perfectly exculpated from all the charges that had been brought\nagainst him; and that, in regard to her requests, speedy and good\njustice should be done her, so that she should be reasonably contented\ntherewith.\n\nA few days after, the young duke of Orleans, Charles, did homage for\nthe duchy of Orleans, and all his other possessions, to his uncle\nCharles king of France: then, taking leave of the queen and dauphin,\nand the princes of the blood who were in Paris, he departed with his\nmen at arms for Blois, whence he had come. The duchess-dowager of\nOrleans remained in Paris.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. II.\n\n    GUYE DE ROVE, ARCHBISHOP OF RHEIMS, APPEALS FROM THE\n    CONSTITUTIONS DRAWN UP BY THE UNIVERSITY OF PARIS, WHICH ANGERS\n    THAT BODY, AND THEY IMPRISON HIS COMMISSARY.\n\n\nAt this period, Guy de Roye[1], archbishop of Rheims, who had been\nsummoned specially by the king to attend the meeting of the prelates at\nParis, assembled to consider on the means of uniting the whole church,\nneither came himself nor sent any one in his behalf. He refused to\nagree to the decisions of this council, and sent a chaplain as his\ncommissary, with letters signed with his name and seal, to confirm his\nopposition to all the statutes they had drawn up, as well for himself\nand his diocese as for all his subjects within the province.\n\nThe king and the clergy were much displeased at this conduct; and the\nuniversity of Paris requested that the commissary should be confined in\nclose imprisonment, where he remained for a long time.\n\nThe cardinal of Bordeaux came at this time to Paris, partly for the\nunion of the church; and then also returned thither master Peter Paoul,\nand the patriarch of Alexandria, named master Symon Cramant, who\nhad been sent by the king of France and the university of Paris, as\nambassadors to the two rival popes.\n\nThe assembled prelates were very anxious for their arrival, that they\nmight be better acquainted with the business they had to manage, and on\nwhat grounds they should proceed. Master Peter Paoul frequently rode\nthrough the streets of Paris in his doctor\u2019s dress, accompanied by the\ncardinal riding on one side of his horse as women do. In the presence\nof this cardinal and doctor, the abbot of Caudebec, of the order of\nCistercians, and doctor in theology, proposed, on the part of the\nuniversity, an union of the church. The abbot of St Denis, with other\ndoctors in theology, declared for an union of the universal church;\nand, shortly after, the cardinal departed from Paris for Boulogne, and\nthence went to Calais.\n\nThe abbot of St Denis and another doctor of theology, who had been, by\nthe king\u2019s orders, confined in the prison of the Louvre, were released,\nat the request of the cardinal de Bar, and set at liberty, contrary to\nthe will of the university of Paris. In like manner did the bishop of\nCambray, master Peter d\u2019Ailly, an excellent doctor of theology, gain\nhis liberty. He had been confined at the instance of the university,\nbecause he was not favourable to their sentiments, and was delivered\nat the entreaties of count Waleran de St Pol, and the great council of\nthe king. All Christendom was now divided in religious opinions, as\nto the head of the church, by the contentions of the two rival popes,\nwho could not be brought to agree on the means to put an end to this\ndisgraceful schism.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. III.\n\n    THE DUKE OF BURGUNDY ASSEMBLES A LARGE BODY OF MEN AT ARMS TO\n    SUCCOUR JOHN OF BAVARIA AGAINST THE LIEGEOIS, AND COMBATS THEM.\n\n\nAbout this time, John duke of Burgundy was busily employed in\ncollecting a body of men at arms to aid his brother-in-law, the bishop\nof Liege, whom, as has been said, the Liegeois had driven out of their\ncountry, and besieged in the town of Maestricht. He sent for succour\namong his friends and allies, namely, to Burgundy, Flanders, Artois,\nand the borders of Picardy, whence came very many, and several from\nSavoy.\n\nThe earl of Mar, also, a Scotsman, then at Bruges, with about four\nscore combatants, ready to embark for Scotland, advanced into the\nTournesis, whither the duke came, and had a conference with their\nprincipal captains in the town of Tournay.\n\nOn the eleventh day of September, he marched thence with a\nnumerous body of men at arms, and a great train of artillery and\nbaggage-waggons to Enghien, where he was gladly received by the lord\nof the place. On the morrow, he advanced to Nivelle in Brabant, within\na league of Salmes. He marched next to Flourines, where he met sir\nRichard[2] Daulphin, sir William de Tignonville, lately provost of\nParis, and master William Bouratier, one of the king\u2019s secretaries,\nambassadors to him from the king of France. Having obtained an\naudience, they said they had been sent to him from the king and the\ngreat council on two objects; first, to know whether the Liegeois and\ntheir bishop were willing to submit their differences to the king and\nthe great council; secondly, to inform him of the suit urged against\nhim by the duchess-dowager of Orleans and her children, for the death\nof the late duke of Orleans, his brother, of the replies they had made\nto the charges he had brought against the late duke, and that they\ndemanded instant justice on him the duke of Burgundy, and that neither\nlaw nor reason ought to prevent sentence being passed by the king\naccording to the conclusions that had been drawn up against him.\n\nThe duke of Burgundy shortly answered, that in regard to the first\npoint, he was willing, as was right for him to do, to obey the king\u2019s\norders, but that his brother-in-law, John of Bavaria, who had married\nhis sister, had most earnestly solicited his assistance against the\ncommonalty and his subjects of Liege, who had rebelled, and even held\nhim besieged. Similar requests had been made to duke William, count\nof Hainault, his brother in law, and also brother-in-law to John of\nBavaria: wherefore the armaments could not now be broken up, since\nduring the time the ambassadors would be negotiating between the two\nparties, John of Bavaria, their bishop and lord, might be in great\ndanger from his rebellious subjects, and their success might serve for\nan example and inducement for other subjects to resist their lords, and\ngive rise to an universal rebellion. He added, that the king and his\ncouncil might, without any prejudice to themselves, have refrained from\nso readily listening to such requests, as none of the aforesaid parties\nwere subjects to the kingdom of France.\n\nIn regard to the second point, he, John duke of Burgundy, made answer,\nthat instantly on his return from this expedition he would wait on\nthe king of France, and act towards him, and all others, in a manner\nbecoming a good subject, and the near relationship in which he stood to\nthe king.\n\nThe ambassadors, finding they could not obtain more satisfactory\nanswers to the points on which they were sent, were obliged to be\ncontented. They resolved, however, to wait the event of this expedition\nagainst the Liegeois; and during that time there came to the duke\nof Burgundy, from the country of Hainault, his brother-in-law duke\nWilliam, accompanied by the counts de Conversan, de Namur, and de\nSalines, in Ardennes, with many notable lords, as well knights as\nesquires, from Hainault, Holland, Zealand, Ostrevant, and other\nplaces, to the number of twelve hundred helmets[3], or thereabout, and\ntwo thousand infantry well equipped, with from five to six hundred\ncarriages laden with provision and military stores.\n\nMany councils were held at Flourines, and in that neighbourhood, as\nto their future conduct, and whither they might march their army\nwith the greatest probability of success. It was determined that duke\nWilliam should command the van, and, as he advanced, destroy the whole\ncountry with fire and sword; that the duke of Burgundy, with the earl\nof Mar and the main body, should direct their march along the causeway\nof Branchaut, which leads strait to Tongres and Maestricht. In the\nlast place, the lord de Pier-Yves[4] and the Liegeois had, as has been\nbefore said, besieged their bishop and lord, John of Bavaria.\n\nIn consequence of this resolution, the two dukes began their march\nby different roads, and destroyed all the country on the Tuesday,\nWednesday and Thursday, and met on the Saturday evening, about vespers,\nin the town of Montenach, situated on the above causeway. In this\nplace and neighbourhood was the whole army lodged, forming but one\nbody; and two marshals were appointed to command and find quarters for\nit;--on the part of the duke of Burgundy, the lord de Vergy[5],--and\non that of duke William, the lord de Jeumont. They had under their\nimmediate orders five hundred helmets, seven hundred cross-bows, and\nfifteen hundred archers, all men of tried courage, with sixteen hundred\ncarriages, as well carts as waggons, laden with arms, ammunition and\nprovision, and all other necessaries for such an expedition.\n\nOn this Saturday, the lord de Pier-Yves, and his son the newly-elected\nbishop of Liege, as they were besieging Maestricht, learnt from their\nspies, that the two before-mentioned dukes were rapidly advancing\nagainst them, and burning the country on their line of march. They\ninstantly raised the siege, and retreated to the city of Liege with\nfull forty thousand combatants, where they fixed their quarters, Liege\nbeing only five leagues distant from Maestricht. The commanders there\nheld a council, with such of the inhabitants as had not been at the\nsiege; and at its close it was proclaimed through different parts of\nthe town, by orders of the governor and his son, the bishop, that every\nman capable of bearing arms should, on the morrow-morning, at the sound\nof a bell, be ready equipped to follow their commanders out of the town\nwhithersoever they might lead them.\n\nIn consequence of this order, on the morrow, the 22d day of September\n1408, there issued out of Liege, according to computation, about fifty\nthousand armed men. In this number were from five to six hundred well\narmed, in the french manner, on horseback, and from one hundred to six\nscore english archers, in their pay. They were followed by infinite\nnumbers of carts and other carriages, and a mob of people dressed in\nvarious manners, according to their own fancies.\n\nThe bell tolled at break of day, and they then sallied forth in good\narray, following their governor and bishop, very eager to offer combat\nto the enemy. Their governor had frequently warned them of the dangers\nthat might ensue from a battle, as their enemies were, for the greater\npart, nobles or gentlemen accustomed to war and obedience to their\ncommanders, which was not the case with them; and that it would be more\nto their advantage to remain within well-inclosed towns and castles\nharrassing the enemy by various means, and so tiring him out that he\nshould be forced to quit their country.\n\nThis advice, however, was not agreeable to the Liegeois, for it seemed\nto them that their numbers were so great that the enemy could not\nresist them; and they were not well pleased with what their governor\nhad told them. The governor, perceiving the Liegeois determined on\nbattle, led them into the plain, and drew them up in handsome array. He\nfrequently exhorted them to behave themselves valiantly, and with one\naccord, this day against the enemy, who was marching to attack them,\nand to defend with courage their lives and liberties.\n\nThey marched near to Tongres, which is five leagues distant from Liege,\nwhither the two dukes had advanced on the Saturday; for they had\nalready heard the siege of Maestricht was broken up, and that the men\nof Liege were intending to offer them battle. After some councils had\nbeen holden with the captains and the most experienced in their army,\nthey sent off, very early on the Sunday morning, two hundred light\ntroops, under the command of Robert le Roux and some other noblemen\nof the country, to inquire into the truth of what they had heard, and\nto see what the enemy was about. They shortly returned, and told the\ndukes, that the intelligence they had received was true, for that they\nhad seen the Liegeois in great numbers marching in battle-array. The\ndukes, on hearing this, commanded their men to arm, and to draw up in\norder of battle. When this was done, they marched to meet the Liegeois,\nand scarcely had they advanced half a league when they appeared in\nsight.\n\nThe Liegeois also saw them, for they were near to Tongres. Both armies\nadvancing, the dukes then posted themselves and all their infantry\non a very advantageous spot; and thinking the enemy would attempt to\ndislodge them, they formed their army into one battalion, the better to\nsupport the attack, and placed their baggage in their rear. They posted\nthe greater part of their archers and cross-bows on their right and\nleft as wings. The lord de Miraumont this day commanded the archers, by\norders of the duke of Burgundy, and with great credit to himself. The\nduke of Burgundy was on the right, and duke William on the left of the\narmy, each attended by his own people.\n\nAfter the proper orders had been given, and every arrangement made\naccording to the advice of the most experienced officers, very many\nnew knights were created. The men of Liege, swelled with pride, and\narrogantly considering the army of their opponents as infinitely\ninferior to them, marched on the right for an eminence called the\nheights of Hasbane, where they halted in handsome array. They had with\nthem the standard of St Lambert, and those of their different guilds;\nand the reason why they had halted on this spot was, that some of their\nold men had told them that it was there their ancestors had gained a\nvictory, and they flattered themselves with similar success.\n\nThey then formed their army in handsome order, and played off many\ncannons against their enemies, which annoyed them very much. It should\nbe known, that between the two armies was a narrow valley, at the\nbottom of which was a ditch to carry off the water in times of rain.\n\nThe two dukes having with their army remained stationary, observing\nthat the Liegeois did not seem inclined to quit their position, and\nbegin the battle, held a short council with their ablest officers,\nand thinking success was more likely to follow the most courageous,\ndetermined to advance slowly toward them in battle-array, on account of\nthe weight of their arms, and attack them where they were, before they\ncould fortify themselves, or increase their numbers by reinforcements.\n\nIn consequence, five hundred men at arms, on horseback, were ordered to\nattack the army of Liege on its rear, and about a thousand infantry,\nunder the command of the lords de Croy, de Helly, de Neufville and de\nRaise, knights, with Enguerrand de Bournouville, esquire, on the part\nof the duke of Burgundy; and by the lords de Hamette and de Ligne,\nknights, with Robert le Roux, esquire, who instantly advanced into the\nplain according to their orders.\n\nThe Liegeois, observing so large a detachment quit the duke\u2019s army,\nand march away, as it were, thought they were running off from fear\nof their great numbers, and began shouting, in their language, \u2018Fuyo,\nfuyo!\u2019 and repeating this word many times. The lord de Pier-Yves, the\ngovernor, like an able man, well versed in war, frequently, but gently,\nchecked them for making this noise, saying, \u2018My very dear friends,\nthat troop on horseback which you see, are not running away, as you\nsuppose; but when that other body of infantry, much greater, as you\nmay observe, shall be advanced near enough to begin the attack, those\non horseback will instantly wheel about, like skilful soldiers, and\ncharge your rear, with a design to divide your army, while the others\nshall attack you in front. Notwithstanding we have every appearance\nof a successful issue to our battle, I have always advised you to the\ncontrary; and though your hearts are set upon it, as if already sure\nof victory, I remain still in the same opinion,--because you are not\nso well used to warfare, nor armed like to your adversaries, who have\nlearnt all military exercises from their childhood. This was the reason\nwhy I proposed avoiding a battle; for it would have been more to your\nadvantage to have defended your towns and fortresses, and whenever a\nfavourable opportunity offered, to have fallen on your enemies, so that\nthey would have been forced to have quitted your country. However, the\nday you have so ardently wished for is now come; and I beg of you to\nput your hopes in God, and boldly and steadily exert yourselves in the\ndefence of your country against the enemy now marching to attack you.\u2019\n\nHaving finished this speech, he wanted to mount some of his most\ndetermined men on horseback to oppose the detachment then on the\nplain; but in truth the commonalty would not suffer it to be done, and\nuttered against him many reproaches, calling him a traitor.\n\nHe patiently suffered their rude ignorance, and hastily commanded the\narmy to be formed into a square, in the front of which was a body drawn\nup in the form of a triangle,--and the carts and baggage were towards\nthe rear, on the right and left of his army, handsomely arranged: their\nhorses were in the rear, on one of the wings, intermixed with their\narchers and cross-bows,--but they were of little value, except the\nenglish archers, who were better disposed of in other places.\n\nThe lord de Pier-Yves, accompanied by his son the bishop and some of\nhis best companions in arms, like a good commander, posted himself at\nthe head of his army, fronting the enemy.\n\nDuring this time, the two dukes began their march, gaily exhorting\ntheir men to behave themselves gallantly against the enemy, a rude\nand ignorant people, who had rebelled against their lord, and who\nconfidently trusted in their superior numbers for success,--telling\ntheir men, that if they acted as they expected they would, victory\nwould infallibly be theirs, and they would gain everlasting honour.\n\nWhen the dukes had made such like speeches, they retired to their\nposts, and under their banners, and advanced slowly toward the enemy,\nwho kept up a heavy fire against them with their cannons.\n\nThe banner-bearer of the duke of Burgundy was a very valiant knight,\ncalled sir James de Courtjambe, who, accidentally falling on his knees\nas he marched, alarmed many, who thought it was an unfavourable omen\nof their success; but he was soon raised by the help of those of his\nguard, and behaved himself honourably the whole day. This knight was a\nnative of Burgundy. The banner of duke William was that day borne by\na gallant knight, called sir Hoste d\u2019Escaussines, who behaved himself\nright well.\n\nWhen the two armies met, the conflict became very severe on each side,\nand lasted for upwards of an hour, when many deadly blows were given\nby both parties. At this moment, the detachment on horseback, with\nthe infantry, according to their orders, advanced to the rear of the\nLiegeois; but from the position of their baggage-waggons, they had\nmuch difficulty to force their way. At length, by dint of courage, they\nsucceeded, and, having gained an entrance, began to lay about them so\nvigorously that the army of the enemy was divided,--and they saw full\nsix thousand Liegeois quit their ranks, with their guns and the banners\nof their guilds, and take flight with all speed towards a village half\na league from the field of battle.\n\nWhen the detachment perceived this, they left off the attack they had\nbegun, and pursued the runaways, whom they charged, not once, but\nseveral times, beating down and slaying them without mercy,--and, in\nshort, routed them so effectually that, through fear of death, they\nfled here and there, into woods and other places, to hide themselves.\n\nThis party of the Liegeois being either killed, dispersed, or taken\nprisoners, the horsemen returned to their main body, gallantly fighting\nthe enemy, who, it must be said, defended themselves courageously. In\ntruth, the event of this battle was some time doubtful,--for, during\none half hour, it could not be known which side would be victorious.\nThe noise of their war-cries was frightful:--the Burgundians and\nHainaulters shouted under their banners, \u2018Our Lady for Burgundy! Our\nLady for Hainault!\u2019 and the Liegeois, in their turn, shouted, \u2018St\nLambert for Pier-Yves!\u2019\n\nThe men of Liege would perhaps have conquered, if this detachment on\nhorseback, when returned from the defeat of the runaways, had not again\nfallen on their rear, and behaved so marvellously well that those who\nopposed them were pierced through, and all attempts to check them were\nvain. A great slaughter was made by them in a short time, for none were\nadmitted to ransom; and by their vigour whole ranks fell one over the\nother, for now all the weight and power of the infantry were brought\nagainst them.\n\nThe defeat once begun, there were such heaps of dead and wounded that\nit was melancholy to behold, for they were thicker in many places than\nstooks of corn in harvest. This ought not to occasion surprise; for\nwhen the common people are assembled, badly armed, and puffed up with\ntheir extravagant desires, although they be in great numbers, yet shall\nthey hardly be able to resist an army composed of noblemen well tried\nin arms, even when God shall permit it so to be. At this period of\nthe battle, and near to the banner of the duke of Burgundy, where the\nconflict was the strongest, fell the lord de Pierre-Yves and his two\nsons,--namely, the one who had been elected bishop of Liege and his\nbrother: they were instantly put to death.\n\nThe heir of Salmes[6], who bore the standard of St Lambert, namely,\nthe eldest son to the count de Salmes[6], who was in the army of the\ntwo dukes; sir John Collet, and many other knights and esquires to\nthe amount of upwards of five hundred; all the english archers, and\nabout twenty-eight thousand of the commonalty, were left dead on the\nfield,--and more perished by arrow-shots than by any other weapon.\n\nSir Baldwin de Montgardin, knight, to save his life, surrendered\nhimself to the duke of Burgundy:--he was led out of the engagement, and\nafterward given by the duke to sir Wicart de Bours.\n\nI have no need to particularise the great courage and coolness of the\nduke of Burgundy, nor how he galloped to different parts of the army,\nexhorting them to act well,--nor how, until the end of the battle,\nhe most gallantly behaved himself,--for in truth, his conduct was\nsuch that he was praised and spoken of by all knights and others;\nand although he was frequently covered with arrows and other missile\nweapons, he did not on that day lose one drop of blood.\n\nWhen he was asked after the defeat, if they should cease from slaying\nthe Liegeois, he replied, \u2018Let them all die together! for I will not\nthat any prisoners be made, nor that any be ransomed!!\u2019\n\nIn the like gallant manner did duke William, the other princes, and in\ngeneral the whole body of the chivalry and nobility of the two dukes\nbehave themselves. There were slain from five to six hundred of their\nmen; and among the number were, John de la Chapelle, knight to the\nabove duke,--sir Flourimont de Brimeu, John de la Trimouille, who on\nthis day had been made a knight,--Hugotin de Nambon, John de Theune,\nviscount de Brimequet, a native of Hainault,--Rollant de la Mote, and\nothers, to the amount of one hundred and six score gentlemen: the rest\nwere varlets[7].\n\nJust as the dukes had gained the victory, about two thousand men made\na sally from Tongres, to assist the Liegemen. When they saw they were\ndefeated, they retreated to their town, but were so closely pursued by\nthe body of horse that had done such essential service that very many\nof them were killed.\n\nThe two dukes, seeing their victory was now complete, met, and returned\nthanks to the Creator, congratulating with one another for their\nsuccess. They had tents pitched on the field of battle, and remained\nthere for three days and three nights.\n\nThe french ambassadors, having now taken their leave, departed for\nTournay, and continued their road to Paris to the king and his council;\nbut prior to their departure, the duke of Burgundy had dispatched a\nmessenger to the king of France, with letters to inform him and his\ngood friends in Paris of the fortunate event of the battle. This news\nwas not very agreeable to many who were intending to urge the king\nto prosecute the duke of Burgundy for the murder of the late duke of\nOrleans,--and on the contrary, it gave great joy to his friends.\n\nOn Monday, the morrow of the battle, about the hour of twelve, John\nof Bavaria, bishop of Liege, attended by the heir of Heinseberg, and\nseveral others, nobles and not nobles, to the number of six hundred\nhelmets, or thereabout, came from the town of Maestricht, wherein\nthey had been besieged, to the camp of the two dukes, and most humbly\nthanked them for the succour they had afforded him. He and his party\nwere received with much joy; and, on his arrival, he was presented with\nthe head of the lord de Pier-Yves, which had been found among the dead,\nwith his two sons, and was fixed to the top of a lance, that all who\npleased might see it!\n\nOn the following Tuesday, the feast of St Fremin, a martyr, the\ninhabitants of Liege, Huy, Dinant and Tongres, and of all the other\ngood towns in the bishoprick of Liege, excepting the castle of\nBouillon, hearing of the great destruction of their countrymen, and the\npower of their enemies, were panic-struck, and, seeing no probability\nof any assistance, surrendered themselves to the obedience of the dukes\nof Burgundy and of Holland. They sent to them ambassadors to this\neffect, and also to supplicate John of Bavaria, their bishop and lord,\nthat he would graciously have pity upon them, and grant them his pardon.\n\nThe bishop, through the intercession of the two dukes, complied with\ntheir request, on condition that such as had been most active in\npromoting the rebellion, many of whom were still alive, whose names\nthey would set down, should be given up to the two dukes, to do by them\nas they in their justice should think right; and each of the towns gave\nsufficient hostages for the due performance of the terms.\n\nOn the ensuing Thursday, the two dukes and the bishop, with the whole\narmy, broke up the camp, and advanced toward the town of Liege. The\nduke of Burgundy was quartered in the town of Flauye, on the river\nMeuse, one league distant from Liege, and duke William among the\nmountains.\n\nOn the following Sunday, the dukes and the bishop held a full council,\nto which all their ministers were admitted, on the present state of\naffairs. Other councils were continued until the Tuesday, when the\nbishop made his entry into Liege, and was received with great humility\nby the remnant of its inhabitants. The most culpable in the late\nrebellion had been before arrested and thrown into prison in this and\nin all the other towns.\n\nThe bishop went first to the cathedral church of St Lambert to offer\nhis prayers, and reconcile himself with the chapter: after this he went\nto his palace, when he was most humbly entreated by the people to have\nmercy on them, which he granted; and, shortly after, he returned to the\ncamp of the two dukes.\n\nAbout two o\u2019clock in the afternoon, on the morrow, the dukes and the\nbishop, with several nobles of the army, assembled on an elevated spot\nnear the camp, whither sir John de Jeumont, marshal to duke William,\nby the commands of the two dukes and the bishop, had ordered the heir\nof Rochefort, a rich nobleman, John de Saramie[8], knight, and fifteen\nother citizens, to be brought from the town, and had their heads cut\noff, one after another, by the executioner. Many churchmen, and some\nwomen, were also drowned in the Meuse for having been concerned in the\nrebellion!\n\nOn the morrow, the dukes and the bishop moved with the army to a town\nthree leagues distant, called Beaucloquet, where many conferences\nwere held, on the state of the country. The count de Nevers joined\nhis brother, the duke of Burgundy, at this place, with four hundred\ncombatants. Hither also sir John de Jeumont ordered nineteen citizens\nfrom the town of Huy to be brought, who underwent a similar punishment\nto those of Liege, and for the same cause; and, as before, many\nchurchmen and women were drowned[9].\n\nAm\u00e9 de Viry, a Savoyard, a nobleman well experienced in war, came\nhither also to aid the duke of Burgundy, and accompanied by three\nhundred helmets from that country. When the dukes and the bishop had\nfor several days consulted together on the affairs of Liege, it was at\nlength concluded, with the approbation of John of Bavaria, now surnamed\nJohn the Pitiless, that they should all meet again in the city of\nTournay, on St Luke\u2019s day next ensuing, to determine finally on the\nmeasures to be pursued touching these matters.\n\nAfter many executions had taken place in the bishoprick of Liege\non those who had been concerned in the rebellion, and when the\nfortifications of the towns of Huy, Dinant and others, had been\ndestroyed, the two dukes began their march homeward, taking with them\na number of persons from Liege, who had been given as hostages for the\nobservance of all the articles of the treaty that should be made with\nthem. Some of them were sent by duke William to Mons and Valenciennes,\nand some to Lille, Arras, and other places belonging to the duke of\nBurgundy, who went to his county of Flanders, and duke William to\nHainault, after they had disbanded their men at arms. The greater part\nreturned to their homes much enriched by the plunder of the Liegeois,\nwho, thunderstruck by the misfortune that had befallen them, became\nstupified and indolent.\n\nMany great lords attended the duke of Burgundy on this expedition:\namong them were, from Burgundy, sir John de Ch\u00e2lons[10], sir Gaultier\nde Ruples, the lord de Vergy[11], marshal of Burgundy, the lord de St\nGeorge, sir John de la Balme[12], sir William de Champ-divers, sir\nJames de Courtjambe, the lord de Montagu, and many more. From Picardy,\nthe lords de Croy[13], de Heilly, de Fosseux, de Vaurin, sir Bort\nGuieret and his brothers, the lord of Inchy, the lord of Raisse, the\nlord de Brimeu, sir Regnault de Crequy lord of Comtes[14], Enguerrand\nde Bournouville, the lord de Ront, sir Raoul de Flandres, the lord de\nPoix, sir Wincart de Bours, the lord d\u2019Auxy, the lord de Mailly, the\nlord de Thiennes and the lord d\u2019Azincourt. From Flanders, sir John and\nsir Louis de Guystelle, the lord de Hames, sir John de Bailleul, sir\nCollart de Fosseux, and others, the principal nobles of the country.\n\nIn like manner, duke William had assembled his nobles, with many\nothers, his allies; among whom was sir John de Bethune, brother to the\nviscount de Meaux. Common report said, that Anthony duke of Brabant,\nbrother to the duke of Burgundy, and Waleran de Luxembourg count\nde St Pol, had refused their assistance, because they had not been\nmade acquainted with the terms and agreements entered into by John\nof Bavaria on the one part, and the lord de Pier-Yves on the other,\nfor the resignation of the bishoprick of Liege. They also made other\nexcuses.\n\nWhen the day appointed for the meeting of the duke of Burgundy, duke\nWilliam and the bishop of Liege, in the town of Tournay, for the final\nsettlement of the affairs of Liege drew near, the inhabitants of\nthat town sent them a petition, by ambassadors chosen from among the\nprincipal citizens, to request they would fix on some other town, as\nthe numbers of their attendants would greatly harrass and impoverish\nthem, considering the very small stock of provision that was in\nTournay. Their request was granted,--and the town of Lille was chosen\nfor their meeting on the day that had before been fixed on.\n\nThither all the hostages from Liege were conducted, and brought into\nthe presence of the aforesaid dukes and bishop, with several more that\nhad been deputed to hear what judgment should be given, which was as\nfollows:\n\n\u2018The dukes of Burgundy and Holland declare, that this their judgment\nshall be punctually fulfilled in every respect, with regard to the\npresent time, reserving to themselves the power of making any future\nalterations in it as often as, and in what manner, they shall please.\n\n\u2018First, They consent that the inhabitants of Liege, of the towns and\ncountry of that bishoprick, situated within the district of Liege,\nthe country of Los, the countries of Hasbane, St Tron, the territory\nof Bouillon, shall enjoy their customary franchises and privileges.\nThey order, that the citizens of Liege, and of the other towns above\nnamed, do bring to the monastery des Escolliers, in the town of Mons\nin Hainault, on the morrow of Martinmas-day next ensuing, all the\nletters patent and charters of their laws and privileges, which they\npossess,--which they will deliver into the hands of such as may be\ncommissioned by the said dukes to receive them. Those who bring them\nshall make oath, on the salvation of their own souls, and of the souls\nof them who sent them, that they have not fraudulently left behind any\ncharters of their laws and privileges.\n\n\u2018Item, the dukes aforesaid declare, that should the city of Liege, or\nany other town, neglect to send, or fraudulently retain, any of their\ncharters, that town so retaining them shall be for ever deprived of its\nprivileges and particular laws.\n\n\u2018Item, the lords aforesaid will, that these charters and letters\npatent be delivered to the commissioners punctually on the morrow of\nMartinmas-day.\n\n\u2018Item, they likewise ordain, that when these charters and privileges\nshall have been duly examined, and new ones drawn up and delivered,\nneither the bishop of Liege nor his chapter shall grant any new\nprivileges to the inhabitants, without the consent of the two dukes or\ntheir successors.\n\n\u2018Item, they also ordain, that henceforward the commonalty shall not\nappoint or nominate, in the aforesaid towns and bishoprick, any\nofficers, such as governors, masters of trades, doctors of arts,--but\nthat from this day all such offices be annulled.\n\n\u2018Item, they ordain, that all bailiffs, provosts, mayors, and others\nbearing similar titles, shall be nominated by the bishop of Liege\nand the count de Los;--and also, that the sheriffs in such towns as\nclaim the right of shrievalty shall be renewed yearly, and a certain\nnumber appointed according to the exigency of the case and size of the\ntowns. In no large town shall father and son, two brothers-in-law, two\ncousins-german, the uncle and nephew, nor anyone who has married the\nmother of another, be appointed sheriffs at the same time, in order\nthat no improper favours be shewn from partiality of kindred. All\nofficers shall swear solemnly on their creation, to preserve and abide\nby every article and point contained in the constitution delivered to\nthem.\n\n\u2018Item, they ordain, that the bishop of Liege may, each year, at the\nexpiration of the shrievalty, appoint such sheriffs as he shall please,\nor re-appoint those of the preceding year, or others according to his\ngood pleasure, provided they are not any way connected by blood, as\nhas been before mentioned. All disputes respecting the persons or\nfortunes of the inhabitants of the different towns having sheriffs,\nshall be brought before their jurisdictions,--and at the end of the\nyear, the sheriffs shall be bound to render an account of their\nadministration before their lord, the bishop of Liege, or his deputies,\nand before one commissary deputed by the chapter, and another on the\npart of the different churches.\n\n\u2018Item, they ordain, that all guilds and fraternities in the city of\nLiege, and in all the other towns, shall henceforth cease and be\nannulled; and that the banners of the above guilds in Liege shall be\ndelivered up to commissaries, on an appointed day that shall be made\nknown to them; and the banners of the other towns shall be brought\nby the inhabitants to a certain place on an appointed day, to the\ncommissioners named to receive them, and who shall do with them as they\nmay judge expedient.\n\n\u2018Item, they also ordain, that in the above city, and in the towns\nwithin the said bishoprick, no one shall be reputed a citizen unless\nhe shall have really resided within such town in which he shall claim\nhis right of citizenship. And all such rights of citizenship are for\nthe present annulled; for although there may be resident citizens in\nthe aforesaid towns, they cannot, in such right, claim any moveables by\nreason of inheritance, without the cognizance of the lords under whom\nsuch persons have lived, and in whose territory such inheritances are\nsituated.\n\n\u2018Item, they ordain, that from this moment, and in times to come, the\ntowns of Huy, Dinant, and others within the territory of Liege, the\ncountry of Los, the country of Hasbane, and all within the jurisdiction\nof Liege, shall no longer call together any assembly, or congregation\nof people, under pretence of holding councils or otherwise, without the\nconsent of their aforesaid bishop and lord, or of the chapter of Liege,\nshould the bishoprick at the time be vacant.\n\n\u2018Item, they ordain, that the bishop of Liege, or any others having the\ngovernment of the said territory and its dependancies, shall never bear\narms against the king or kings of France, their successors; nor against\nthe two said dukes, their successors in the said duchies and counties;\nnor against the count de Namur for the time being, or his successors;\nnor against any of the countries, of the aforesaid, except when ordered\nby the emperor, and only when the emperor shall be himself present:\nprovided, nevertheless, that the king of France and the above-mentioned\npersons do not invade the territories of the bishop and chapter of\nLiege.\n\n\u2018Item, they likewise ordain, that in perpetual remembrance of this\nvictory, and the conquest made over them by the above two dukes, they\nand their successors shall have a free passage, whenever they may\nchoose to cross the river Meuse, through all towns in the territory of\nLiege, fortified or not, and with a body of men at arms or with few\nattendants according to their pleasure,--provided they do not permit\nany of the inhabitants of the said towns, villages, or country through\nwhich they shall pass, to be any way molested by their men,--and\nprovisions shall be found them for their money, without demanding\nhigher prices for the articles than they are usually sold for.\n\n\u2018Item, they ordain, that the coin of the aforesaid dukes and their\nsuccessors shall have free currency throughout the territories and\ndependancies of the bishop and chapter of Liege.\n\n\u2018Item, they ordain, that a chapel shall be erected on the spot where\nthe last victory was gained, and funds allotted for the support of four\nchaplains and two priests; and the said chapels shall be furnished\nwith chasubles, chalices, and other ornaments for celebrating mass\nand such other divine services as shall be thought advisable for the\neternal welfare of the souls of those who were slain in that battle.\nThe nomination to the above benefices shall remain with the two dukes,\naccording to regulations which they shall hereafter make between\nthemselves,--the Liegeois only to be once at the expense of providing\nthis chapel with sacred vessels and ornaments. The bishop of Liege\nshall allot from his revenues two hundred golden crowns of annual rent\nfor the support of the four chaplains and two priests; that is to say,\nfor each chaplain forty crowns, for each priest ten crowns, and for the\nrepairs of the chapel twenty crowns.\n\n\u2018Item, the said dukes will, that on the twenty-third day of every month\nof September, on which day the battle took place, a mass shall be\ncelebrated to the blessed Virgin, with great solemnity, by the provost\nor dean of the church of St Lambert, in Liege, who shall chaunt it in\nthe choir and at the grand altar, in commemoration of this victory,\nand for the welfare of the souls of those who fell in battle. The same\nshall be required of all the churches and chapels to monasteries, as\nwell for men as women, within the said town of Liege, as of all others\nwithin its jurisdiction.\n\n\u2018Item, the said dukes require from the bishop of Liege and the chapter,\nthat they strictly enjoin such services to be regularly performed on\nevery twenty-third day of September throughout the diocese; and that\nall priests, after the performing of this service, shall be suffered\npeaceably to return to their homes.\n\n\u2018Item, they ordain, that the bishop of Liege and his successors, and\nsuch as may have the government of the country in times of a vacancy\nin the see, and the members of the chapter of Liege, shall appoint\nsuch governor of the castle of Huy as they shall approve of: in which\ncastle, likewise, they shall not place a greater garrison, nor more\nstores of provision, than they shall judge expedient, like as an\nupright lord shall determine. They also insist on having a free ingress\nand regress into and from the town of Huy and the adjacent country.\nThey likewise ordain the same regulations respecting the castles of\nEscoquehen[15] and Bouillon, as to their governors, garrisons and\nstores.\n\n\u2018Item, the aforesaid dukes ordain, that should any one, however\nhigh his rank, attempt, by force, or otherwise, to deprive those of\nsuch gifts and preferments in the church, or any other offices for\nlife, as have been usually granted by the bishops of Liege and their\npredecessors, the members of the chapter of Liege shall be bound to\nrestore, and defend them in, their possessions to the utmost of their\npower, without any fraud whatever.\n\n\u2018Item, as there are still living many perverse conspirators, who are\nnow fugitives from the territories of Liege and county of Los, and\nhave retired into the neighbouring countries, where they have been\nreceived, the dukes aforesaid will appoint proper commissioners to\nmake inquiry whither such wicked persons have gone, and publish their\nnames. On the discovery of the places to which they have withdrawn,\napplications shall be made to the princes and lords thereof, that they\nmay be surrendered to the bishop of Liege, for him to inflict on them\nthe punishments due to their deserts, or at least that such princes\nand lords may drive them out of their respective countries. But should\nthese lords refuse to comply, or to do justice on such conspirators,\nthey shall be for ever banished from the bishoprick of Liege, the\ncounty of Los, and their dependancies, as conspirators and movers of\nsedition; and it shall be proclaimed throughout the above countries,\nthat no one receive them within their houses, but deliver them up\nto justice, should any attempt to return, demanding assistance from\ntheir lord, should there be a necessity for it. Should they be unable\nto arrest them, they shall denounce them to the nearest officers of\njustice, under pain of suffering corporal punishment, and having their\nfortunes confiscated, as would have been done to such conspirators\nand rebels. While exerting themselves in the performance of this\nduty, should they accidentally put to death any of such rebels, no\nconsequences shall ensue to their loss.\n\n\u2018Item, they ordain that the walls of the castle of Thuin, with its\ngates and towers, be razed, as well the part toward the town as that\ntoward the mountain, and the ditches filled up.\n\n\u2018Item, the same to be done to the town of Fosse and to the town\nand castle of Commun,--which towns shall not be repaired. And in\nlike manner shall all the posts on the river Sambre be destroyed,\nthe ditches filled, and neither they nor the towns shall be ever\nagain repaired, so that they may serve for places of defence to the\ninhabitants, on any pretence, in future times.\n\n\u2018Item, the gates, walls and towers of Dinant shall be pulled down, as\nwell on the opposite side of the Meuse as on this; and the inhabitants\nshall never rebuild them again.\n\n\u2018Item, the inhabitants of the said towns of Thuin, Fosse, Commun and\nDinant, or any persons from other towns, shall not rebuild or repair\nthe fortified places between or on the two rivers Sambre and Meuse, on\nthe road to Namur.\n\n\u2018Item, one of the gates of Tongres shall also be razed, namely, that\nwhich leads to Maestricht, with forty feet of wall on each side of the\nsaid gate, without a possibility of its ever being re-erected. The town\nof Tongres shall likewise, at its own expense, cause to be filled up\nthe trenches they had opened before the said town, when they besieged\ntheir lord within it, because they had put the country of Liege under\nheavy taxes, and had subjugated it.\n\n\u2018And whereas it is notorious, that very great losses have attended this\nsubjugation, the aforesaid dukes will, that an aid be levied on this\ncity, and the towns before mentioned, to the amount of two hundred and\ntwenty thousand golden crowns, which shall be raised as soon as may be,\nbeing levied in proportion to the comparative riches of each inhabitant.\n\n\u2018Item, in case any of the hostages shall die before all the articles\nof this treaty are completed, the aforesaid lords will, that the town\nor district whence such hostage or hostages shall have been sent, do\ninstantly furnish others of the same rank and property as those who\nhave died.\n\n\u2018Item, they ordain, that when this treaty shall be properly engrossed,\nthe bishop of Liege, his chapter, and the principal inhabitants, shall\ncome to sign it, and engage, that should any articles of it be not\ncompleted according to the exact tenor of the terms, then for each\nomission or neglect the bishop, his successors, the chapter and chief\ntowns shall forfeit two hundred thousand golden crowns of the coin of\nthe king of France, or other florins of gold of France, of the value\nof the aforesaid crowns. That is to say, fifty thousand to the then\nemperor or king of the Romans; to the king of France fifty thousand;\nand to each of the said dukes the like sum;--the whole to be levied on\nthe lands and moveables of the said Liegeois, by seizure of their goods\nand bodies wherever they may be.\n\n\u2018They are likewise to signify their consent, that should obstacles be\nthrown in the way by any of the said towns to prevent the articles\nof the said treaty from being carried into effect, the bishop of\nLiege, and the archbishop of Cologne for the time being, shall be the\narbitrators between such towns,--and their decision shall be final.\n\n\u2018When a legal pope shall be elected, and his authority over the whole\nchurch of God be acknowledged, then such as make opposition to the\nexecution of the above treaty shall be laid under an interdict, which\nshall not be taken off, until sufficient reparation be made, and the\naforesaid pecuniary forfeitures be paid.\n\n\u2018Should any of the towns, or their inhabitants, offer any insult, in\ncontradiction to the above treaty, to either of the said dukes or\ntheir successors, the bishop of Liege, or his vicar in his absence,\nthe chapter and citizens shall be required to constrain the offenders\nto make full reparation within one month from the time of complaint\nbeing made. And should such reparation not be made within the month,\nas aforesaid, after the summons to that effect has been delivered, the\ncountry shall be liable to the same fines as before mentioned.\n\n\u2018The dukes of Burgundy and of Holland order, that all these articles be\nfairly engrossed, and then sealed with their seals, and then given to\nthe lord bishop of Liege, or to his chapter, with a copy for the city\nof Liege and one for each principal town. In return, the bishop and the\ntowns shall give to the dukes aforesaid letters signed with their great\nseals acknowledging the receipt of the above treaty, and promising\nobedience to all the articles of it, and binding themselves to the\nfines therein mentioned.\n\n\u2018As many noble persons and others, as well secular as ecclesiastic,\nhave presented many petitions to complain of the great losses they have\nsuffered during the late rebellion, and specifying their particular\ngrievances,--the dukes aforesaid, not having had time to examine them\nwith the attention they deserve, will have them examined with all\npossible speed, and will attend to each of them.\u2019\n\nThe whole of the above, having been written out fair, was, by the\ncommand of the two dukes aforesaid, publicly proclaimed in the great\nhall at Lille, and in their presence, the 24th day of October, in the\nyear 1408.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. IV.\n\n    THE KING OF FRANCE HOLDS A GRAND COUNCIL AT PARIS, TO CONSIDER\n    ON THE MANNER OF PROCEEDING AGAINST THE DUKE OF BURGUNDY FOR\n    THE MURDER OF THE DUKE OF ORLEANS.\n\n\nDuring the expedition of the duke of Burgundy against the Liegeois, a\ngreat many of the principal lords were, by the king\u2019s orders, assembled\nat Paris. Among them were, Louis king of Sicily, Charles king of\nNavarre, the duke of Brittany, the duke of Bourbon, and several others,\nthe greater part of whom were friendly to the duchess-dowager of\nOrleans and her children in their prosecution of the duke of Burgundy.\nMany councils were held as to the manner in which the king should\nproceed against the duke of Burgundy, who was the principal actor in\nthis murder, as has been before explained.\n\nIt was at length determined in these councils, that a most rigorous\nprosecution, in conformity to the laws, should be carried on against\nhim; and should he refuse to obey, the king, with all his subjects\nand vassals, should march, with as great a force as could be raised,\nagainst him, to bring him and his abettors to due obedience.\n\nAt the same time, at the solicitations of the duchess of Orleans\nand her children, the king annulled all his letters of pardon which\nhe had formerly granted to the duke of Burgundy, and declared them\nof no weight, in the presence of the queen, the duke of Acquitaine,\nthe princes of the blood, and the whole of the council. The duchess\ndemanded and obtained letters, confirming this renunciation of the\npardon; after which, she and her daughter-in-law, wife to the young\nduke of Orleans, left Paris, and returned to Blois.\n\nNot long after this, news came to Paris of the great victory which\nthe duke of Burgundy had gained over the Liegeois. This was confirmed\nby the return of the king\u2019s ambassadors, sir Guichard Daulphin and\nsir William de Tignonville, who, as has been related, were present at\nthe battle, and gave to the king and the lords then in Paris a most\ncircumstantial account of it. On hearing this, several who had been\nmost violent against the duke of Burgundy, now hung their heads, and\nbegan to be of a contrary opinion to what they had before held, fearing\nthe steadiness, boldness and power of the duke, who was said to have a\nmind equal to the support of any misfortunes that should happen to him,\nand which would encourage him to oppose and conquer all attempts of his\nadversaries. In short, all the measures that had been adopted against\nhim were dropped, and the men at arms were ordered to return to the\nplaces whence they had come.\n\nAmbassadors had arrived from England to treat of a peace, or a truce\nfor one year, between the kings of England and of France, which having\nobtained, they set out on their return, through Amiens and Boulogne,\nto Calais. On the road, they heard of the grand victory of the duke\nof Burgundy, which surprised them very much,--and they gave him the\nsurname of \u2018Jean sans peur.\u2019\n\nThe duke of Burgundy was very active in attaching to his party noblemen\nand warriors from all countries, to strengthen himself against his\nenemies, of whom he was given to understand that he had many. He\nheld on this subject several consultations with his two brothers and\nbrothers-in-law, namely, duke William of Holland and John of Bavaria,\nto which were admitted his most trusty friends; and they deliberated\nlong on the manner in which he should now carry himself. It was at\nlength finally concluded, that he should openly oppose all, excepting\nthe king of France and the duke of Acquitaine; and those present\npromised him aid and support with all the power of their vassals, on\nthese terms.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. V.\n\n    THE KING OF FRANCE IS CARRIED, BY THE PRINCES OF THE BLOOD,\n    TO TOURS IN TOURAINE.----PEACE IS MADE IN THE TOWN OF\n    CHARTRES.--THE DEATH OF THE DOWAGER DUCHESS OF ORLEANS.\n\n\nThe king of France left Paris, accompanied by the kings of Sicily and\nNavarre, the queen, the duke of Acquitaine, the dukes of Berry and\nBourbon, who, with others of the blood-royal, conducted him, under\nthe escort of a large body of men at arms, to Tours in Touraine, as\nhis place of residence,--to the great displeasure of the inhabitants\nof Paris, who were so much troubled thereat that they barricadoed the\nstreets with chains. They hastily sent to inform the duke of Burgundy,\nat Lille, of the king\u2019s departure, giving him to understand that the\ngreater part of those who had carried him away from Paris were not well\ninclined towards him.\n\nThis intelligence was not very agreeable to the duke, for he suspected\nthat the king had only been conducted to Tours that his enemies might\ncarry their measures against him more securely; for the lords who had\nthe government knew well that the Parisians loved the duke of Burgundy,\nand would not that any other should have the government of the kingdom,\nbelieving, from the hints he had thrown out, that when in power he\nwould abolish all gabelles and other taxes which oppressed the people.\n\nThe duke of Burgundy first consulted the dukes of Brabant and of\nHolland, and other steady friends, and then remanded his men at arms\nfrom Burgundy, who were on their march to their own country from Liege,\nand assembled another body from various parts. He advanced to Roye, in\nthe Vermandois, where he mustered his men, and then marched them toward\nParis. He quartered himself, on the 23d day of November, in the town of\nSt Denis, and his forces in the adjacent country. On the morrow, as he\nwas advancing with his men at arms in array toward Paris, two thousand\nor more combatants sallied out thence, and conducted him, with every\nmark of honour, to his h\u00f4tel of Artois.\n\nMany of the Parisians sung carols in the squares, although all\nrejoicings had been strictly forbidden on his arrival, to avoid\nincreasing the envy of the princes of the blood. Some of the king\u2019s\nservants said to those who were singing carols, \u2018You may otherwise\nshow your joy for his arrival, but you ought not thus to sing.\u2019\nNotwithstanding this, all the principal citizens, and those in\nauthority, showed him as much honour and respect as if he had been king\nhimself.\n\nA few days afterward, duke William, count of Hainault, arrived at\nParis, well accompanied by unarmed men, and, at the request of the\nduke of Burgundy, set out for Tours, attended by the lords de Croy,\nde St George, de la Viefville, d\u2019Olhaz, and others of the council of\nthe duke, to negotiate his peace with the king, and the lords who had\ncarried him from Paris. The count of Hainault was most honourably\nreceived at Tours by the king, the queen, and the other great lords;\nfor the marriage had taken place between John duke of Touraine, second\nson to the king, and the daughter of the duke of Burgundy: he was also\nnearly related to the queen.\n\nOn the conclusion of the feasts made on his arrival, the count of\nHainault and those who had accompanied him opened, in full council,\nthe business of their mission, namely, to make peace for the duke\nof Burgundy. After many discussions, it was resolved, that the king\nshould send certain persons, selected by him, to hold a conference with\nthe duke of Burgundy at Paris, and point out to him the means of his\nregaining the good graces of the king.\n\nDuke Louis of Bavaria, brother to the queen, Montagu grand master of\nthe king\u2019s household, and other experienced counsellors, were nominated\nfor this purpose; and they returned with the count de Hainault to\nParis, when what had passed was told to the duke of Burgundy.\n\nAs all the circumstances of this treaty were not agreeable to the duke,\nand as he had many suspicions respecting Montagu, he was not disposed\nto receive the negotiators in the way they were sent to him. He even\npersonally made many reproaches to Montagu, who bore them patiently,\nexcusing himself for any thing that had passed. The treaty, however,\nhaving been altered and corrected, was sent back to the king at Tours,\nand in the end agreed to in the manner you shall hear.\n\nWhile these negotiations were going forward, and before their\nconclusion, the duchess-dowager of Orleans, daughter to Galeazzo duke\nof Milan, died in the town of Blois, broken-hearted at not having been\nable to obtain justice from the king and council against the duke of\nBurgundy for the murder of her late lord and husband, Louis duke of\nOrleans. The duke of Burgundy was much rejoiced at this event, for the\nduchess had bitterly carried on her prosecution against him.\n\nHer heart was buried at Paris, near that of her husband, and her body\nin the church of the canons at Blois. After her death, Charles, her\neldest son, was duke of Orleans and of Valois, count of Blois and of\nBeaumont, lord of Coni and of Ast, with many other lordships:--Philip,\nthe second son, was count of Vertus,--and John, the youngest, was named\ncount of Angoul\u00eame. These three brothers, and one sister, thus became\norphans, but they had been very well educated; yet, by the deaths of\nthe duke and duchess of Orleans, they were much weakened in support\nand advice,--and several of the king\u2019s ministers were not so zealous\nto prosecute the duke of Burgundy as they had been. This was very\napparent in the negotiations which took place some little time after\nthe death of the duchess, between the duke of Burgundy and the children\nof Orleans; for although the treaty sent by the king was not wholly to\nthe liking of the duke, as has been said, yet it was so corrected that\nthe parties accepted of it, in the following terms:\n\nFirst, it was ordered by the king and his great council, that the duke\nof Burgundy should depart from Paris with his men at arms, and return\nto his own country, where he was to remain until a certain day, namely,\nthe first Wednesday in February, when he was to meet the king at the\ntown of Chartres, accompanied only by one hundred gentlemen at arms,\nand the children of Orleans with fifty. It was also ordered, that duke\nWilliam, count of Hainault, should have under his command four hundred\nof the king\u2019s men at arms, to preserve the peace. It was also ordered,\nthat the duke of Burgundy, when he appeared before the king, should be\nattended by one of his council, who should repeat the words he was to\nsay; and the duke, in confirmation of them, was to add, \u2018We will and\nagree that it should be thus.\u2019\n\nAfterward, according to the tenor of the treaty, the king was to say to\nthe duke of Burgundy, \u2018We will, that the count de Vertus, our nephew,\nhave one of your daughters in marriage.\u2019 The duke was by this treaty to\nassign over to his daughter three thousand livres parisis yearly, and\ngive her one hundred and fifty thousand golden francs.\n\nWhen this treaty had been concluded, duke William set out from Paris\nfor Hainault; and shortly after, the duke of Burgundy disbanded his men\nat arms, and left Paris to go to Lille, whither he had summoned the\nduke of Brabant his brother, duke William and the bishop of Liege, his\nbrothers-in-law, and many other great lords.\n\nAt this period, there was a great quarrel between the duke of Brabant\nand duke William. It was caused by the father of duke William having\nborrowed in former times from the late duchess of Brabant one hundred\nand fifty thousand florins to carry on a war against some of his\nrebellious subjects in Holland, which sum the duke of Brabant had\nclaimed as belonging to him. He had in consequence, by the advice\nof his Brabanters, taken possession of a castle called Heusden[16],\nsituated between Brabant and Holland.\n\nThe duke of Burgundy took great pains to make up the quarrel between\nthese two princes, that they might the more effectually assist him in\nhis plans, which were very extensive. After this business had been\nsettled, and the parties had separated, duke William assembled in\nHainault, according to the king of France\u2019s orders, four hundred men\nat arms and as many archers. The principal lords among them were, the\ncounts de Namur, de Conversant and de Salmes. The duke of Burgundy,\nconformably to the treaty, set out, the day after Ash-Wednesday,\nattended by his son-in-law the count de Penthievre[17], and lay at\nBapaume. Thence he went to Paris, with duke William, the above-named\nlords, the count de St Pol, the count de Vaudemont[18], and several\nothers of the nobility.\n\nOn Saturday, the 2d day of March, they arrived all together at the\ntown of Gallardon, four leagues distant from Chartres. The Wednesday\nfollowing, duke William of Holland advanced with his body of forces to\nChartres, where the king then was. On the ensuing Saturday, the duke\nof Burgundy set out from Gallardon, to wait on the king, escorted by\nsix hundred men at arms; but when he approached Chartres, he dismissed\nthem all, excepting one hundred light horsemen, in compliance with the\ntreaty, and thus entered Chartres about ten o\u2019clock in the morning,\nriding strait to the church as far as the cloisters of the canons,\nwhere he was lodged.\n\nAt this same time, the duke of Orleans, in company with his brother the\ncount de Vertus, and, according to the treaty, attended by only fifty\nmen at arms, entered the church of our Lady at Chartres, with the king\ntheir uncle, the queen, the duke of Acquitaine, and several princes of\nthe blood.\n\nThat the king and lords might not be pressed upon by the spectators,\nand that all might plainly see the ceremony, a scaffolding was erected\nin the church, on which the king was seated near the crucifix. Round\nhim were placed the queen, the dauphin and dauphiness, daughter to the\nduke of Burgundy, the kings of Sicily and Navarre, the dukes of Berry\nand Bourbon; the cardinal de Bar, the marquis du Pont his brother, the\narchbishop of Sens, and the bishop of Chartres, with other counts,\nprelates, and the family of Orleans were behind the king. At the\nentrance of the church, by the king\u2019s orders, were a body of men at\narms drawn up in battle-array.\n\nIt was not long before the duke of Burgundy entered the church, and on\nhis advancing toward the king, all the lords, excepting the king, queen\nand dauphin, rose up from their seats. The duke, on his approach to the\nking, kneeled down with his advocate the lord d\u2019Ollehaing, who repeated\nto the king the following words:\n\n\u2018Sire, behold here my lord of Burgundy, your subject and cousin, who\nis thus come before you, because he has heard you are angry with him,\nfor the action he has committed against the person of the late duke of\nOrleans your brother, for the good of yourself and your kingdom,--the\ntruth of which he is ready to declare and prove to you, whenever you\nshall please. My lord, therefore, entreats of you, in the most humble\nmanner possible, that you would be pleased to withdraw from him your\nanger, and restore him to your good graces.\u2019 When the lord d\u2019Ollehaing\nhad said this, the duke of Burgundy himself addressed the king, saying,\n\u2018Sire, I entreat this of you:\u2019--when instantly the duke of Berry,\nseeing the king made no reply, bade the duke of Burgundy retire some\npaces behind,--which being done, the duke of Berry, kneeling before\nthe king, said something to him in a low voice,--and immediately the\ndauphin, the kings of Sicily and Navarre, with the duke of Berry, knelt\ndown to the king, and said, \u2018Sire, we supplicate that you would be\npleased to listen to the prayer of your cousin the duke of Burgundy.\u2019\nThe king answered them, \u2018We will that it be so,--and we grant it from\nour love to you.\u2019\n\nThe duke of Burgundy then approached the king, who said to him,--\u2018Fair\ncousin, we grant your request, and pardon you fully for what you have\ndone.\u2019 After this, he advanced, with the lord d\u2019Ollehaing, toward the\nchildren of Orleans, who, as I have said, were behind the king weeping\nmuch.\n\nThe lord d\u2019Ollehaing addressed them, saying, \u2018My lords, behold the\nduke of Burgundy, who entreats of you to withdraw from your hearts\nwhatever hatred or revenge you may harbour within them, for the act\nperpetrated against the person of my lord of Orleans, your father, and\nthat henceforward ye may remain good friends.\u2019 The duke of Burgundy\nthen added, \u2018And I beg this of you.\u2019 No answer being made, the king\ncommanded them to accede to the request of his fair cousin the duke\nof Burgundy. Upon which they replied, \u2018Sire, since you are pleased to\ncommand us, we grant him his request, and shall extinguish all the\nhatred we bore him; for we should be sorry to disobey you in any thing\nthat may give you pleasure.\u2019\n\nThe cardinal de Bar then, by the king\u2019s orders, brought an open Bible,\non which the two parties, namely, the two sons of the late duke of\nOrleans and the duke of Burgundy swore on the holy evangelists,\ntouching them with their hands, that they would mutually preserve a\nfirm peace towards each other, without any open or secret attempts\ncontrary to the full meaning of their oaths. When this was done, the\nking said, \u2018We will that henceforth ye be good friends; and I most\nstrictly enjoin, that neither of you attempt any thing to the loss or\nhurt of the other, nor against any persons who are attached to you,\nor who may have given you advice or assistance; and that you show\nno hatred against any one on this occasion, under pain of offending\nagainst our royal authority,--excepting, however, those who actually\ncommitted this murder, who shall be for ever banished from our kingdom.\u2019\n\nAfter this speech of the king, these princes again swore they would\nfaithfully abide by their treaty. The duke of Burgundy then advanced\nto salute the wife of the dauphin, the duke of Acquitaine; and about\nan hour after this ceremony had taken place the duke took his leave\nof the king, queen, and the lords present, and set out from Chartres\nfor Gallardon, where he dined. Many who were there were very much\nrejoiced that matters had gone off so well; but others were displeased,\nand murmured, saying, that henceforward it would be no great offence\nto murder a prince of the blood, since those who had done so were so\neasily acquitted, without making any reparation, or even begging pardon.\n\nThe duke of Orleans and his brother shortly after took leave of the\nking, queen, dauphin, and the lords of the court, and returned, with\ntheir attendants, to Blois, whence they had come, not well satisfied,\nany more than their council, with the peace that had been made.\n\nThe marquis du Pont, son to the duke of Bar, and cousin to the duke of\nBurgundy, who before this day was not beloved by him, on account of\nthe murder of the duke of Orleans, followed him to Gallardon, where\nthey dined publicly together in great friendship and concord. About two\no\u2019clock in the afternoon duke William, the count de St Pol, and other\ngreat lords, visited the duke of Burgundy at his lodgings in Gallardon,\nand then returned together toward Paris.\n\nThe king, the queen, the dauphin, and the other kings, princes and\ncardinals, arrived at Paris on Mid-Lent Sunday; and the dukes of\nBurgundy and of Holland, with the cardinal de Bordeaux, who was at that\ntime in Paris, on his way to the council of Pisa, went out to meet\nthem, followed by upwards of two hundred thousand Parisians of both\nsexes, eager to receive the king, singing carols, as he entered the\ngates, and conducting him with great rejoicings to his palace.\n\nThey were very happy that the king was returned to Paris, and also that\na peace had been concluded respecting the death of the late duke of\nOrleans. They attributed the whole to the great mercy of God, who had\npermitted that such strong symptoms of a civil war should be so readily\nextinguished; but they did not foresee or consider the consequences\nthat ensued.\n\nThe greater part of the Parisians were obstinately attached to the\nduke of Burgundy, through the hope that by his means all the most\noppressive taxes would be abolished; but they did not see clearly all\nthe mischiefs that afterward befel the kingdom and themselves,--for in\na very short time, as you shall hear, a most cruel contention broke out\nbetween the families of Orleans and Burgundy.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. VI.\n\n    THE QUEEN OF SPAIN DIES DURING THE SITTING OF THE COUNCIL AT\n    PISA.--THE MARRIAGE OF THE KING OF DENMARK, NORWAY AND SWEDEN.\n\n\nIn this year died the queen of Spain[19], sister to Henry king of\nEngland, and mother to the young king of Spain and queen of Portugal.\nThe Spaniards after her death sent home all the english servants, male\nand female, belonging to the late queen, who returned to England in\nmuch grief and sorrow at heart.\n\nAt this same season, great numbers of prelates, archbishops, bishops\nand abbots, set out from various countries of Christendom to attend the\ncouncil at Pisa which was assembling to restore union to the church,\nwhich had for a long time suffered a schism, to the great displeasure\nof many princes and well-inclined persons.\n\nAbout this same period, Henry[20] king of Denmark, Norway and Sweden,\ntook to wife the daughter of Henry king of England. These kingdoms were\nput into the hands of the king of Denmark by their queen, who divested\nherself of all power and profit over them in favour of king Henry.\n\n\n\n\n[A. D. 1409.]\n\nCHAP. VII.\n\n    THE KING OF FRANCE HAS A SEVERE RETURN OF HIS DISORDER.--THE\n    MARRIAGE OF THE COUNT DE NEVERS WITH THE DAMSEL OF COUCY.--THE\n    WAR OF AM\u00c9 DE VIRY, A SAVOYARD, WITH THE DUKE OF BOURBON.\n\n\nAt the beginning of this year, Charles king of France was much\noppressed with his usual disorder. On this account, when the kings of\nNavarre and Sicily, and the duke of Berry, had properly provided, in\nconjunction with the duke of Burgundy, for the state of the king, and\nthe government of the realm, they went to visit their own territories.\nIn like manner, the duke of Burgundy, went to the marriage of his\nbrother Philip count of Nevers, who took to wife the damsel of Coucy,\ndaughter to sir Enguerrand de Coucy[21], formerly lord and count of\nSoissons, and niece by the mother\u2019s side to the duke of Lorraine and to\nthe count de Vaudemont; which marriage was celebrated in the town of\nSoissons.\n\nThis ceremony was performed on Saint George\u2019s day, and the feasts and\nentertainments lasted for three days afterward. There were present the\nduchess of Lorraine[22] and the countess of Vaudemont[23], who had come\nexpressly thither to do honour to the lady of Coucy and her daughter.\n\nWhen these feasts were over, the duke of Burgundy, attended by his\nson-in-law the count de Penthievre, set out for Burgundy; and shortly\nafter, the count de Nevers conducted his wife, and the duchess of\nLorraine and the countess of Vaudemont, to his county of Rethel, where\nshe was received with every token of joy.\n\nDuring this time, the duke of Bourbon was challenged by Am\u00e9 de Viry,\na Savoyard, and a poor blade in comparison with the duke of Bourbon;\nnevertheless, he committed much damage by fire and sword in the\ncountries of Bresse and Beaujolois. The duke was very indignant at\nthis, and assembled a large body of men at arms and archers to punish\nand conquer him. He ordered his son, the count de Clermont, to lead on\nthe van, and he speedily followed in person.\n\nIn his company were the counts de la Marche and de Vend\u00f4me, the lord\nd\u2019Albret, constable of France, Louis de Baviere, brother to the queen,\nMontagu, grand master of the king\u2019s household, the lord de la Heuse and\nmany more great lords, who advanced with a numerous body of men to the\ncounty of Beaujolois.\n\nAm\u00e9 de Viry was informed of the great force which the duke of Bourbon\nwas marching against him, and dared not wait his arrival; for he had\nnot strength enough to garrison the forts he had taken. On his retreat,\nhe marched to a town called Bourg-en-Bresse, which belonged to the earl\nof Savoy, his lord. The earl, however, would not support him against\nhis great uncle, the duke of Bourbon, but gave him up, on condition\nthat Am\u00e9 should make every amends in his power for the mischiefs he had\ndone, and should surrender himself to one of the prisons of the duke,\nuntil he should have completely made him satisfaction, but that no harm\nof any sort should be done to his person.\n\nThe duke of Bourbon gladly received him, and thanked his nephew for his\nfriendship.--This caused a quarrel of some standing to be made up; for\nthe earl of Savoy had declared his great uncle owed him homage for his\nlands of Beaujolois, which he would not pay,--but now the dispute was\nmutually referred by them to the duke of Berry.\n\nWhen these matters were concluded, the duke of Bourbon returned to\nFrance, and disbanded his forces. Some time after, by means which Viry\nmade use of with the duke, he obtained his liberty. Waleran count de\nSt Pol intended being of this expedition with the duke of Bourbon, and\nraised a large force; but on marching near Paris, he was ordered not to\nproceed further, and to return to the frontiers of the Boulonois, where\nhe had been specially commissioned by the king.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. VIII.\n\n    TWO COMBATS TAKE PLACE AT PARIS IN THE PRESENCE OF THE\n    KING.----THE DEATH OF THE ARCHBISHOP OF RHEIMS.----THE COUNCIL\n    AT PISA.\n\n\nAbout Ascension-day, the king of France, who had been grievously ill,\nwas restored to health,--and in consequence, the dukes of Berry,\nBurgundy, and Bourbon, with many other lords, instantly returned to\nParis. Two combats were ordained to be fought in the square behind St\nMartin des Champs, in the presence of the king and the aforesaid lords.\nOne was between a breton knight, called sir William Batailler, and an\nEnglishman, named sir John Carmien, for a breach of faith.\n\nWhen they were met, and Montjoye king at arms had proclaimed their\nchallenges and the causes of them, in the accustomed manner, he bade\nthem do their duty. Sir William, who was the appellant, issued first\nout of his pavilion, and marched proudly toward his adversary, who was\nadvancing to meet him. They threw their lances without effect, and\nthen made use of their swords: but in this last combat the Englishman\nwas slightly wounded below his armour, when the king instantly put an\nend to the fight. They were both very honourably led out of the lists,\nand conducted to their lodgings.\n\nThe other combat was between the seneschal of Hainault and sir John\nCornwall, an english knight of great renown, and who had married a\nsister to the king of England[24]. This combat was undertaken by the\ntwo knights at the desire of the duke of Burgundy, when at Lille, to\nshow their prowess in running a few courses with the lance and giving\nsome strokes with the battle-axe: but when the duke had caused the\nlists to be prepared, the two champions were ordered by the king to\nrepair to Paris, and to perform their deeds of arms in his presence.\n\nAccording to these orders, and on the appointed day, sir John Cornwall\nentered the lists first, very grandly equipped, and, galloping his\nhorse around, came before the king, whom he gallantly saluted. He was\nfollowed by six little pages mounted on as many war-horses, the two\nfirst of which were covered with furniture of ermines, and the other\nfour with cloth of gold. When he had made his obeisances, the pages\nretired without the lists.\n\nShortly after, the seneschal arrived, attended by the duke of Brabant\nand his brother, the count de Nevers, each holding a rein of his horse,\non his right and left. The count de Clermont bore his battle-axe, and\nthe count de Penthievre his lance. When he had made the circuit of the\nlists, and had saluted the king, as sir John Cornwall had done, they\nprepared to tilt with their lances; but as they were on the point of so\ndoing, the king caused it to be proclaimed that they should not proceed\nin this matter, which was very displeasing to both of them, and forced\nthem to return to their h\u00f4tels.\n\nIt was again proclaimed, by the king\u2019s orders, that this deed of arms\nshould not be carried further,--and that in future no one, under pain\nof capital punishment, should, throughout his realm, challenge another\nto a duel without a substantial cause.\n\nWhen the king had magnificently feasted these two knights, and shown\nthem much honour at his court, they departed, as it was said, for\nEngland, with the intention of completing their deed of arms.\n\nDuring this time, the cardinal de Bar, son to the duke of Bar, and\nGuye de Roye, archbishop of Rheims, in company with master Peter\nd\u2019Ailly, bishop of Cambray, and several other prelates and churchmen,\nwere journeying to the general council which was to be held at Pisa,\nand took up their lodgings one night at a town called Voltri, on the\nsea-coast, about four leagues from Genoa. At this place the blacksmith\nof the archbishop had a quarrel with a blacksmith of the town, about\nthe price of shoeing a horse, which proceeded from words to blows, and\nthe archbishop\u2019s blacksmith killed the other, and fled instantly for\nsafety to the lodgings of his master.\n\nThe townsmen immediately rose,--and a great number of them came to\nrevenge the death of their countryman. The archbishop, hearing of the\ncause of this tumult, left his chamber, and kindly addressed them,\npromising to have the injury immediately repaired, according to their\nwishes; and, the more to appease them, he delivered up his blacksmith\ninto the hands of the magistrate of the place, who was a lieutenant of\nBoucicaut marshal of France, then governor of Genoa.\n\nBut this was of no avail,--for as the archbishop was speaking to them,\nwithout the door of his house, one of the mob thrust his javelin right\nthrough his body to the heart, so that he dropped down dead without\nuttering another word. It was a great pity, for he was a religious\nprelate, and of a noble family.\n\nThis deed, however, did not satisfy them; for instantly after they\nmurdered the magistrate and the aforesaid blacksmith, and also\nendeavoured to force their way into the house, whither the cardinal de\nBar and the greater part of the others had retired, in order to put\nthem likewise to death.\n\nThey were, however, at length appeased by the principal inhabitants,\nand it was concluded that the cardinal should grant them his pardon for\nwhat they had done against him,--to which, indeed, he was induced by\nhis attendants, from their fears of being all destroyed.\n\nThey never told him of the murder of the archbishop until he was gone\ntwo leagues from the town: on the hearing of it, he was so troubled,\nand sick at heart, that he was near falling off his mule. His\nattendants, notwithstanding, made him hasten his pace as much as they\ncould; for they were alarmed for their lives, after the instances they\nhad seen, and from the numbers of people they perceived descending\nthe hills, and the accustomed signs they saw when a town is under any\napprehension of danger, and the ringing of bells in the manner usual on\nthese occasions.\n\nThese signals were sounded throughout the country, and the peasants\nwere seen running down the hills to overtake them; but when they were\narrived within a league of Genoa, the marshal Boucicaut[25] came out\nwith a handsome company to meet him. The cardinal made loud complaints\nto him of the outrages that had been committed on his people at the\ntown of Voltri, and demanded that he would judicially inquire into it.\nThe marshal replied, that he would make so severe an example of that\ntown that all others should take warning from it.\n\nThe cardinal was then conducted into the city of Genoa, where he was\nmade welcome by the churchmen and other inhabitants; and this same\nday the body of the archbishop of Rheims was brought thither, and\nhonourably interred,--and his obsequies were performed in the principal\nchurch of Genoa.\n\nShortly after, the marshal Boucicaut punished most severely all whom\nhe could apprehend that had committed these outrages, with their\naccomplices: they were put to death in various ways, and their houses\nalso were razed to the ground, that these executions might serve for\nwarnings to others never to commit such cruel murders.\n\nThe cardinal de Bar, with his companions, now set out from Genoa, and\ntravelled, by easy day\u2019s journies, to Pisa, where were assembled a\nprodigious number of cardinals, doctors in theology, and graduates in\ncivil law and other sciences, ambassadors and prelates, in obedience\nto the two popes, from different kingdoms, and from all parts of\nChristendom.\n\nAfter many councils had been held on the schism in the church, they\ncame at last to this conclusion: they unanimously condemned the\ntwo rival popes as heretics, schismatics, obstinate in evil, and\nperturbators of the peace of our holy mother the church. This sentence\nwas passed in the presence of twenty-four cardinals, at the gates\nof Pisa, before all the people, the 15th day of June, in the year\naforesaid.\n\nThe same cardinals, after invoking the grace and assistance of the\nholy Spirit, entered into conclave, where they remained until the 16th\nday of the same month, when they finished their election. They chose\nPeter of Candia, so named from being a native of that island: he was\nof the order of Friars Minors, created a doctor in theology at Paris,\narchbishop of Milan and cardinal; and, when consecrated sovereign of\nthe true and holy catholic church, he took the name of Pope Alexander V.\n\nO, most powerful God! how great was the joy thus caused, through thy\nnever-failing grace; for it is impossible to relate the shoutings and\nacclamations that resounded for more than a league round the city of\nPisa. But what shall we say of the city of Paris? Why, when this joyful\nnews was brought thither, on the 8th of July, they incessantly shouted,\nnight and day, \u2018Long live Alexander V. our pope!\u2019 in all the squares\nand streets, and entertained all passengers with meat and drink, from\ntheir heartfelt happiness. When the ceremony of consecrating the pope\nwas over, letters were sent to different persons, the more fully to\nexplain the proceedings of the council. I shall insert the one written\nby the abbot of Saint Maixence to the bishop of Poitiers, the tenor of\nwhich was as follows.\n\n\u2018Reverend father, and my redoubted lord, after my humble respects being\naccepted, I know that your reverence would gladly be informed of the\nproceedings of the council, which has been held in the city of Pisa,\nand any intelligence concerning it; and it is for this reason I have\nindited the following lines to your reverence.\n\n\u2018First, then, on the 25th day of March all the cardinals, who had been\ncreated by both popes, and all the prelates then in Pisa, assembled\nin the church of St Martin, which is situated beyond the river, on the\nroad leading to Florence, and thence being dressed in their robes, with\nmitres on their heads, they made a grand procession to the cathedral\nchurch, which is as distant from that of Saint Martin as our church of\nN\u00f4tre Dame at Paris is from that of St Martin des Champs. There the\ncouncil always afterward assembled; and on this first day, mass was\ncelebrated with great solemnity: the sermon was preached by my lord\ncardinal of Milan, of the order of Friars Minors, a great theologian.\nWhen the service was over, the morrow was fixed on to open the council,\nand the two popes were summoned to attend on that day at the gates of\nthe church by two cardinals; but neither of them appeared, nor any one\nfor them.\n\n\u2018The council continued to sit till the latter end of March, when the\npopes were again summoned to appear, but neither of them obeyed. The\ncouncil therefore having required the two rival popes to come before\nthem, on account of the schism that has reigned in the church, and\nneither of them appearing, or sending any one to make satisfactory\nanswers for them, and the term allotted for their appearing being\nelapsed, declared them both guilty of the schism that distresses the\nchurch, and of contumacy, by their conduct, toward the council.\n\n\u2018The council ordered prosecutions to be carried on against both of the\npopes, on the Monday after Quasimodo-Sunday, the 15th of April, when\nmy lords cardinals celebrated together the service of the holy week.\nOn Good Friday, my lord cardinal d\u2019Orsini celebrated divine service in\nSaint Martin\u2019s church; and a secular doctor of divinity, from Bologna\nla Grassa, preached an excellent sermon.\n\n\u2018My lords cardinals were all present at the ceremonies of Easter\nSunday. During the ensuing week they assembled in council, sometimes\nalone, at others they called in the prelates, to deliberate on the\nstate of affairs, and what line of conduct should be pursued; and every\nthing was carried on with mutual good will on all sides. This week the\nambassadors from the king of the Romans arrived at Pisa.\n\n\u2018On the Sunday of Quasimodo, an italian bishop said mass before the\ncardinals; and a cordelier from Languedoc, a doctor in divinity\npreached the sermon, in which he greatly praised my lords cardinals\nfrom France, and such as were seeking to restore peace to the\nchurch,--but very harshly treated the two contending popes, calling\nthem schismatics, heretics, and traitorous enemies to God and to his\nchurch. He chose for his text, \u2018Jesus dixit, Pax vobis,\u2019 which he\nhandled extraordinarily well.\n\n\u2018The following Monday, the cardinals, prelates, ambassadors, and\nprocurators then present, made oath to obey the decisions of the\ncouncil. Mass was then chaunted, and succeeded by many prayers; then\nthe litany was sung, at which all the cardinals and prelates, dressed\nin their robes and mitres, attended, and so continued as long as the\nsittings of the council lasted, which made it a handsome sight to see.\n\n\u2018This same day, the council gave audience to the ambassadors from\nRobert king of the Romans; and the bishop of Verdun, on the part of\nRobert, who favoured pope Gregory as much as he could, began his\nharangue, taking for his theme, \u2018Pax vobis.\u2019 He made many mischievous\npropositions, to divide and distract the council, in obedience to\nhis master, and to serve the false pope Gregory. There were with\nthis bishop an archbishop of a foreign order, and a numerous body of\nattendants. When the bishop had made his propositions, the ambassadors\nwere required to deliver the same in writing, and to show their\nprocurations from their lord. A day was then fixed to hear the answer\nof the council to their propositions; but before this day arrived, the\nambassadors went away without taking leave of their host.\n\n\u2018This week of Quasimodo, the lord Malatesta came to Pisa in great\nstate: he had given to pope Gregory one of his castles called\nRimini[26], and made the following request to the cardinals assembled,\nas well on the part of pope Gregory as on his own,--namely, that it\nwould please the members of the council to adjourn its sittings, and\nchange the place of its meeting; that if they would so do, pope Gregory\nwould attend personally, provided the situation were in a place of\nsafety, and that he might have security for his coming to and going\nfrom it.\n\n\u2018In consequence of this request, the cardinals summoned the prelates to\nnotify it to them; but they unanimously declared, they would neither\nconsent that the place of holding the council should be changed nor\nthat the meetings of it should be adjourned. This answer was very\nagreeable to the cardinals. The lord Malatesta, therefore, returned\nwithout having succeeded in his object; but his anger was appeased by\nsome of the cardinals, his friends and acquaintance.\n\n\u2018From the 15th of April, the council continued sitting to the 23d\nof the said month,--when, after the solemnity of the mass, the\nadvocate-fiscal demanded, that the council should declare, that the\nconjunction of the two colleges of cardinals of the holy church of Rome\nhad been, and was, lawful and canonical at the time it was formed.\n\n\u2018Item, that it should declare, that this holy council is duly\ncanonical, by the cardinals of both colleges assembling for so\nexcellent a purpose.\n\n\u2018Item, that this holy council has been called together by the cardinals\nof both colleges with a good intent.\n\n\u2018Item, that it has been assembled at a convenient opportunity.\n\n\u2018Item, that it should declare, that this holy council, as representing\nthe universal church of God, has a right to take cognizance of the\nmerits of the two competitors for the papacy.\n\n\u2018Item, that a narrative should this day be read of the introduction and\ncommencement of the schism that took place from the time of the death\nof pope Gregory X. until the convention of this holy general council.\n\n\u2018In this narrative were displayed all the tricks and deceits that had\nbeen made use of, either individually or conjunctively by the two rival\npopes.\n\n\u2018After it had been read, the advocate fiscal drew several conclusions\nagainst the said rivals and their pretensions to the papacy, and ended\nhis harangue by demanding that they should be deposed and punished\ncorporally, and that the council should proceed to the election of a\ntrue and holy pope.\n\n\u2018The sittings were prolonged to Saturday the 27th day of the same\nmonth, when the ambassadors from the king of England entered the\ncouncil with a most magnificent state.--The bishop of Salisbury[27],\nin the diocese of Canterbury, made a handsome speech, urging the\nnecessity of peace and union in the church.\n\n\u2018When he had finished, the advocate-fiscal made an interesting oration,\nand concluded by demanding, through the procurator of the holy council,\nthat it would please to appoint a commission of certain wise, discreet,\nand experienced persons to examine witnesses as to the notorious sins\ncharged on the two competitors for the papacy, and his request was\ngranted.\n\n\u2018The second Sunday after Easter, mass was celebrated before the\ncardinals, and the sermon was preached by the bishop of Digne in\nProvence: he was of the order of Friars Minors, a learned doctor in\ndivinity, and had ever been a great friend to Pietro della Luna, and\nwas well acquainted with the tricks and cavils of both popes. This\nbishop delivered a good sermon from his text of \u2018Mercenarius fugit,\u2019 in\nwhich he discovered many deceptions of the two rivals, in descanting on\nthe words of his text.\n\n\u2018The sittings were continued from this Sunday to the 2d day of May,\nwhen mass was said before the cardinals; and the sermon was preached\nby the cardinal Prenestin, more commonly called the cardinal of\nPoitiers.--He delivered a good discourse, and chose for his text,\n\u2018Libera Deus Israel ex omnibus tribulationibus suis.\u2019 He urged in his\nsermon eleven conclusive arguments against the two popes, for refusing\nto give peace to the church, and ended by requiring the council, in\nconsideration of their obstinate contumacy, to proceed against them and\nprovide a pastor for the flock of God.\n\n\u2018On the 2d day of May, there was a general meeting of the council,\nwhen, after the usual solemnities, a very renowned doctor of Bologna\nmade a reply to the insidious propositions of the bishop of Verdun, on\nthe part of the emperor Robert. He condemned, by arguments drawn from\ndivine, canon, and civil law, all that had been advanced by the bishop;\nand his reasoning was so just and clear that the council were much\nsatisfied and comforted.\n\n\u2018The ensuing Sunday, mass was said before the cardinals, and the sermon\nwas preached by the general of the order of Augustins. He was a great\ndoctor in divinity, and a native of Italy. He chose for his text, \u2018Cum\nvenerit ille arguet mundum de peccato, et de justitia, et de judicio.\u2019\nHe discussed this subject very well, and with a good intent.\n\n\u2018The sittings were prolonged from this 2d of May to the 10th.--The\npatriarch of Alexandria celebrated mass before the cardinals on the\nfeast of the revelation of St Michael, the 8th of May; and he likewise\npreached a sermon, taking for his text, \u2018Congregata est ecclesia ex\nfiliis Israel et omnes qui fugiebant a malis additi sunt, et facti\nsunt illis ad firmamentum.\u2019 These words are written in the 2nd and 5th\nchapters of the first book of Machabees. In the course of this sermon,\nhe pressed six arguments against the two rival popes.\n\n\u2018On Friday, the 10th of May, the council, after the usual solemnities,\nresumed its sittings, when the advocate-fiscal made the following\nrequisitions: that the holy council would be pleased to confirm and\napprove the demands he had before made, namely, that it should declare\nthat the union of the two colleges of cardinals has been and is legal;\nand that the council should pronounce definitively on the other demands\nhe had made. The procurator fiscal made a request to the council, that\neight days should be allowed for the production of witnesses; and the\ncouncil was adjourned to the 16th of May.\n\n\u2018On the Sunday preceding that day, mass was said before the cardinals\nby the bishop of Faenza; and the sermon preached by a native of\nArragon, a learned doctor in divinity, who had always been of the party\nof Pietro della Luna. He chose his text from one of St Paul\u2019s epistles,\n\u2018Expurgate vetus fermentum ut sitis nova conspersio.\u2019 He expatiated on\nthis with such ability that all the doctors wondered. Drawing from it\ncertain conclusions, he said that the two rivals were as much popes\nas his old shoes, calling them worse than Annas and Caiaphas, and\ncomparing them to the devils in hell.\n\n\u2018Such things passed in the council to the 23d day of this present\nmonth, as I have briefly related, on which day the ambassadors from the\nking of Spain were to come to Pisa. The number of prelates that were\npresent cannot be estimated, for they were daily increased by new ones,\nwho came from all parts of Christendom. I should suppose that at the\nlast sitting of the council there were present of cardinals, bishops,\narchbishops, and abbots, wearing mitres, one hundred and forty, without\ncounting the non-mitred members.\n\n\u2018There were also ambassadors from the kings of France, England,\nJerusalem, Sicily, Cyprus, and Poland; from the dukes of Brabant,\nAustria, Stephen of Bavaria, William of Bavaria; from the counts of\nCleves and of Brandac[28]; from the marquis of Brandenbourg and de\nMoraine[29]; from the archbishops of Cologne, Mentz and Saltzbourg, and\nfrom the bishop of Maestricht; from the grand master of the Teutonic\norder; from the patriarch of Aquileia, and from many princes in Italy.\nNumbers of doctors in divinity, and in the canon and civil law, were\npresent, as well from France as from other countries, and very many\nprocurators from divers parts of the world, who, by the grace of God,\nhave held instructive and charitable conversations together from the\ncommencement of the council until this moment.\n\n\u2018In the city of Pisa are abundance of all sorts of provisions, which\nare sold at reasonable prices; but they would be much cheaper, were\nit not for the gabelles and taxes that are levied in these countries.\nIn my mind, Pisa is one of the handsomest cities existing: it has a\nnavigable river, within a league distant, running into the sea,--and\nwhich river brings large vessels, laden with different merchandise, to\nthe town. Around the city are vineyards of white grapes and many fine\nmeadows.\n\n\u2018We are very well lodged, considering the great number of men at\narms quartered in it for its guard. The town has been conquered by\nthe Florentines, who have banished many of the Pisans to prevent any\ntreasons, and sent them to Florence, to the amount of two thousand; and\nthey are obliged to show themselves twice every day to the governor at\nan appointed place, under pain of death.\n\n\u2018Four or five thousand of the Pisans went to ask succour from king\nLancelot[30], who, in compliance with their request, advanced within\nfive leagues of Pisa, with a force of twenty-three thousand combatants,\nas well horse as foot; but the Florentines, through the grace of God,\nare well able to resist all his power, and guard us. True it is, that\nthis king Lancelot ran a risk of losing his kingdom by the union of\nthe holy church, for he had tyrannically seized on a large part of the\npatrimony of St Peter.\n\n\u2018It was said that there were certain ambassadors from Pietro della Luna\nat the council, not with the intent of forwarding the union, but of\nthrowing every obstacle in its way.\n\n\u2018There were nineteen cardinals of both colleges, at this council\nat Pisa, including the cardinal de Challan, whose attendants were\narrived,--and the cardinal was to follow with the ambassadors from\nSavoy.\n\n\u2018My lords the cardinals are much displeased with those bishops,\nabbots, and chapters of cathedral churches, who have neglected to send\nprocurators to this general council. I have nothing more to send to\nyou at present.--Written at Pisa the 15th day of May, by your humble\nmonk and servant, the abbot of St Maxence.\u2019\n\nThe direction was, \u2018To the reverend father in JESUS CHRIST, and by the\ngrace of God, lord bishop of Poitiers, and chancellor to my lord the\nduke of Berry.\u2019\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. IX.\n\n    THE AMBASSADORS TO THE COUNCIL FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF PARIS\n    WRITE LETTERS, TO INFORM THOSE WHO HAD SENT THEM OF WHAT\n    HAD PASSED AT THIS COUNCIL.--PIETRO DELLA LUNA AND GREGORY\n    ARE DEPRIVED OF THE PAPACY, AND ALL PERSONS FORBIDDEN BY\n    THE HOLY COUNCIL FROM OBEYING EITHER IN ANY MANNER.--PETER\n    OF CANDIA, A CORDELIER, IS ELECTED BISHOP OF ROME BY THE\n    CARDINALS.--REGULATIONS FOR THE APPROBATION OF THE GENERAL\n    COUNCIL.\n\n\nI shall now transcribe the letters written by the ambassadors from the\nuniversity of Paris to the council at Pisa, the contents of which are\nas follows.\n\n\u2018Reverend fathers, lords and masters, after offering you our humble\nrecommendation, may it please you to know, that we write to inform you\nof the conclusions entered into by the council-general, which has held\nthirteen sittings.\n\n\u2018The two rival popes, having for some time been waited for in vain,\nnotwithstanding the summons sent them, have been declared contumacious\nin respect to schism and the faith. Many decrees were passed against\nthem for their contumacy, and commissioners were appointed to examine\nwitnesses against them.\n\n\u2018Item, the council-general approved of the union of the colleges of\ncardinals, the citations served on the contending popes, and the place\nof meeting of the council, as being perfectly convenient and secure.\nThe council declared, that it was supreme on earth to take cognizance\nand judge of the charges brought against the contenders for the papacy.\nIt was also declared by the council, that it had been lawful for any\none to quit his obedience to either of the popes, from the moment they\nhad promised to abdicate the papacy; and that all suits and processes,\ncarried on against such as had quitted their obedience to either, were\nannulled and of no weight.\n\n\u2018Public charges were then made against them, and an interlocutory\nsentence passed on the notorious sins of the two competitors. This\nday, doctor Peter Paoul declared, in full council, your opinions,\nand took for his text, \u2018Congregabuntur filii Jud\u00e6 et filii Israel et\nfacient sibimet caput unum.\u2019 That is to say, Those who are come to\nthis council, and such as shall hereafter come, will choose from among\nthemselves a head to the church. A little before this, doctor Dominic\nle Petit had made a solemn harangue before all the cardinals, taking\nfor his text, \u2018Principes populorum congregati sunt cum Deo Abraham.\u2019\nThe cardinals and prelates of the holy church are styled princes of\nthe people. On this day also, the theologians, to the number of six\nscore and three, delivered their opinions, and eighty of them are your\nfriends and supporters.\n\n\u2018Item, this day it has been ordered that the two rival popes be\nsummoned to appear at the doors of the church on Wednesday the 5th of\nJuly, to hear their definitive sentence.\n\n\u2018Gregory has sent a bull to the English to entreat they would be of his\nparty, with Robert king of the Romans, to change the place of holding\nthe council, and that they would please to be of his council; but\nhe labours in vain, for the English, Germans, Bohemians, Polanders,\nFrench, those from Cyprus, Rhodes and Italy, are all unanimous,\nexcepting Robert, whose ambassadors have gone away.\n\n\u2018Few prelates have come to this council from the kingdom of Hungary.\nKing Ladislaus wrote that he intended being here in person, but he is\nfully occupied in his war against the infidels.\n\n\u2018Pietro Mastin, called della Luna, has issued a most thundering bull,\nin which he admonishes the cardinals to return to their duty toward\nhim; and should they refuse, he prohibits them from attempting to\nmake another election, menacing them, in case of disobedience, with\nexcommunication and other penalties against them and their supporters.\n\n\u2018Reverend fathers, and redoubted masters, we have nothing more for the\npresent to write to you, except that all nations seem inclined to a\nreformation in the church, which the new pope, whom it shall please\nGod to elect, will be forced to comply with. Should you have any orders\nto send us, we are ready to obey them to the utmost of our power.\nBeseeching you humbly to keep all our concerns in your consideration,\nmay the Sovereign Lord have you under his guard!\n\n\u2018Written at Pisa the 29th day of May.\u2019 Underneath were signed the\nnames of Dominic le Petit, Pierre Paoul de Quesnoy, Jean Pere Ponce,\nVincent, Eustace de Faquemberge, Arnoul Vibrant, Jean Bourlet, dit\nFran\u00e7ois.--Master Pierre de Poingny and master Guillaume le Charpentier\ndid not sign the above, because they were absent.\n\nHere follows the sentence on the two contending popes.\n\n\u2018This present holy council, assembled in the name of JESUS CHRIST,\nwithdraws itself from the obedience to Pietro della Luna, called Pope\nBenedict XIII. and from Angelo Corrario, called Pope Gregory XII.; and\nthe holy council decrees and declares, that all true Catholics ought to\ndo the same.\n\n\u2018Item, the same holy synod, as representative and judge of the\nuniversal church, after mature consideration and examination of\nwitnesses concerning the horrible sins of the two contending popes,\npronounces, in the church of Pisa, this its definitive sentence, that\nboth popes be deprived of every honour and dignity, especially that of\nthe papacy. It also pronounces, that they be separated from the holy\nchurch, in conformity to the sacred canons, and by the above sentence,\nforbidding all persons to have the boldness ever to defend or obey\neither of them as pope.\n\n\u2018The council forbids any Christians from obeying or showing favour\nto either, notwithstanding any oath or promise they may have made or\nentered into, under pain of excommunication,--and decrees, that whoever\nshall disobey this sentence shall be delivered into the hands of\nsecular justice, and condemned as one who favours heretics, and that he\nshall be punished according to the divine commandments, and the decrees\nof the holy canons.\n\n\u2018The council also declares and pronounces, that all promotions of\ncardinals made by the two rival popes, namely, those made by Angelo\nCorrario since the 3d day of May, and by Pietra della Luna since the\n15th day of June, of the year 1408, have been and are of no effect,\nand are annulled by this definitive sentence. It also declares, that\nevery judgment given by the aforesaid competitors for the papacy, to\nthe prejudice of the holy church, against any kings, princes, lords,\npatriarchs, archbishops, bishops, prelates of the church, or other\nprivate persons, are of no effect; and the holy synod has ordained that\nproceedings to the contrary, and to the welfare of the holy church\nshall commence on the ensuing Monday, the 10th day of June.\u2019\n\nThe above sentences and declarations were passed in the general council\nof Pisa, the 5th day of June, in the year 1409.\n\nThe 26th day of June, in the year 1409, Peter of Candia, a Cordelier\nand native of Greece, doctor of divinity, and usually called the\nCardinal of Milan, was unanimously chosen pope by the cardinals at\nPisa, with the approbation of the general council, and called Alexander\nV. who, immediately after his election, published the following bull.\n\n\u2018Alexander, bishop and servant to the servants of God, to the bishop\nof Paris, health and apostolical benediction. Praise and glory be to\nthe God of heaven for having instilled into the minds of men a desire\nof peace on earth, and who, through his benign grace and mercy, has\nbrought about an union of his Christian people, hitherto long disturbed\nby a dangerous schism.\n\n\u2018Who is there among mankind that will not most heartily rejoice at\nthis happy event, on considering the perils souls must run when such\ndivisions take place in the holy church, and which have for so long a\ntime been encouraged by sacrilegious schismatics?\n\n\u2018Our blessed God, taking pity on his people, who had long suffered\nfrom this division, opened and illuminated the minds of the holy\ngeneral council, who have justly condemned the two popes, according\nto the sacred canons, as enemies to God and his holy church, by their\nenormous, horrible, and notorious sins.\n\n\u2018When our brethren, the venerable Cardinals of the holy roman church,\nof whom we were one, were desirous of finding a proper pastor for the\nChristian flock, after the usual ceremonies and solemnities, with the\nconsent of the council-general, they entered into conclave, where,\nafter long discussions, they unanimously selected our humble self, then\ncardinal-priest of the church of the Twelve Apostles, and chose us\nbishop of Rome. Although we knew our unworthiness of so great a charge,\nconsidering our weakness, yet, always confiding in the aid of God, we\nhave accepted of it.\n\n\u2018Venerable brother, these things we notify to thee, as one loving and\ndesirous of the peace of the church, as we have been well informed;\nand we exhort thee and thy flock to render thanks to the all-powerful\nGod for this most gracious gift which he has granted to us. We have so\ngreat an affection for thy worthy person, that we inform thee, that we\nare ready to serve thee and thine to the utmost of our power.--This\npresent letter we have intrusted to be delivered to thee by our\nwell-beloved son, that notable man Paulin d\u2019Arc\u00e9, esquire of honour,\nchamberlain, and our loyal servant.--Given at Pisa the 8th day of July,\nin the first year of our papacy.\u2019\n\nIt is the good pleasure of our very sacred lord Alexander V. by divine\nProvidence, pope, that all promotions, translations, confirmations and\ncollations whatever, and all consecrations of bishops and others, that\nhave been granted or performed by the two competitors for the papacy,\nshall be considered as strictly legal, provided they were effected\nprior to passing of the definitive sentence, and done according to the\nregulations of the canon law.\n\nItem, it is also the pleasure of the general council, that our\naforesaid lord shall give his orders concerning the archbishop of Genoa.\n\nItem, the benefices in the church, that had been given by ordinary\njudges, have the approbation of the holy council to continue to them to\nwhom they have been given.\n\nItem, the holy council approves of proceedings being instituted against\nall who shall obstinately obey or favour either of the late competitors\nfor the papacy, Pietro della Luna or Angelo Corrario,--and the council\ncondemns such, as guilty of schism and notorious heresy, and ordains\nthat they be punished according to the regulations of the sacred canons.\n\nItem, it is ordered, that should the cardinal de Flisque[31] be willing\nto return to his duty, and appear personally within two months, he\nshall be kindly received, and enjoy all his honours and benefices,\nwhich he obtained in the year 1408.\n\nItem, all dispensations given by bishops of dioceses in those parts\nnot obedient to the two competitors, in the cases of persons not being\nof sufficient age to obtain dignities in the church or benefices,--and\nall absolutions, and acts of penitence, ordained by the competitors\nduring the schism, shall be reserved to the determination of the holy\napostolic see. All of which has been approved of and certified by the\nholy council.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. X.\n\n    THE DEATH OF THE BISHOP OF PARIS.----THE MARRIAGES, OF THE\n    DUKE OF BRABANT WITH THE NIECE OF THE KING OF BOHEMIA,--OF THE\n    CONSTABLE OF FRANCE\u2019S DAUGHTER WITH THE SON OF MONTAGU, GRAND\n    MASTER OF THE HOUSEHOLD,--OF THE KING OF CYPRUS WITH CHARLOTTE\n    DE BOURBON.\n\n\nIn these days, the lord John d\u2019Orgemont, bishop of Paris, departed this\nlife, in his episcopal palace, about the end of June. He was succeeded\nin his bishoprick by the lord Gerard de Montagu, bishop of Poitiers,\nchancellor to the duke of Berry, and brother to the grand master of\nthe king\u2019s household and to the archbishop of Sens. He was honourably\nreceived in the cathedral church of N\u00f4tre Dame in Paris, the 22d day of\nSeptember following.\n\nThe king of France, the dukes of Berry, Burgundy, and Bourbon, the king\nof Navarre, and several other princes, with prelates and churchmen\nwithout number, were present at his consecration. With the aid of the\ngrand master, his brother, the feast he gave on the occasion was the\nmost magnificent ever seen, in regard to the quantity of gold and\nsilver plate, and the diversity and abundance of meats and liquors.\nFrom this grand display, the princes observed that the grand master\ngoverned the king as he pleased; and they began to form suspicions as\nto the uprightness of his conduct.\n\nOn the 16th day of July following, duke Anthony of Brabant married, at\nBrussels, the niece of the king of Bohemia[32], heiress to the duchy\nof Luxembourg in right of her father. This marriage had been concluded\nby the mediation of the bishop of Ch\u00e2lons and sir Regnier Pot.\n\nSeveral knights, esquires, ladies and damsels of high rank, had\naccompanied the lady to Brussels, according to the orders of the king\nof Bohemia, her uncle. There were present at these nuptials the two\nbrothers of the duke of Brabant, the duke of Burgundy and the count de\nNevers, with their sister, wife to duke William count de Hainault; the\ncount de Charolois and the countess of Cleves, children to the duke of\nBurgundy; the marquis du Pont, his brother John[33] and their sister,\nthe countess de St Pol[34], all three children to the duke de Bar; the\ncounts de Namur and de Conversant, with their ladies, with many more of\nthe great nobility of both sexes.\n\nThe count de Clermont, son to the duke de Bourbon, was also there,--and\nwhen he tilted was attended by the duke of Burgundy and count de\nNevers. The duke bore his shield and the count his lance, to the\nsurprise of many present, on account of the great hatred that had so\nlately subsisted between them for the murder of the duke of Orleans:\nhowever, they seemed then to be in perfect concord. This feast was\nabundantly served with all sorts of provisions and wines,--and when it\nwas ended, the different guests retired to their respective countries.\n\nOn the last day but one of the same month of July, the marriage of the\ndaughter of the lord d\u2019Albret, constable of France, with the eldest\nson of Montagu[35], grand master of the king\u2019s household, was solemnly\ncelebrated. The queen of France and numbers of the great nobles were\npresent,--and the whole of the expense was paid by the king, which\ncreated much anger and envy in several of the princes of the blood\nagainst Montagu.\n\nAt this time, the truces were broken between the kings of France and of\nEngland, but only at sea; and a bitter naval war ensued, to the great\nloss of many merchants in each country.\n\nOn the 2d day of August, John de Lusignan, king of Cyprus, espoused by\nproxy, Charlotte de Bourbon, sister-german to the count de la Marche.\nThe ceremony was performed in the castle of Melun, in the presence of\nthe queen of France, the duke of Acquitaine and her other children,\nthe king of Navarre, the dukes of Berry and of Bourbon, the counts de\nla Marche and de Clermont, the lord Louis de Baviere, brother to the\nqueen, and many ladies and damsels, who greatly amused themselves in\ntournaments, dances, in feastings and other pastimes.\n\nThe lady Charlotte, queen of Cyprus, was very handsome, and well\nendowed with noble and gracious manners. On the conclusion of these\nfeasts, she departed for Cyprus, most honourably accompanied by the\nnobles so ordered by her brother, and also by those who had been sent\nto her from the king of Cyprus. She landed at the port of Chermes,\nwhither the king came to meet her, much rejoiced at her safe arrival,\nand conducted her, attended by the greater part of the nobility of\nthe island, to Nicosia, where were made many feasts, according to the\ncustom of the country. They reigned for a long time with much honour,\nand had two children, of whom more shall be spoken hereafter.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XI.\n\n    THE DUKE OF BURGUNDY HOLDS A GREAT COUNCIL AT LILLE ON HIS\n    AFFAIRS.--THE DEATH OF THE DUCHESS OF ORLEANS.\n\n\nOn the 5th of August, and the eight succeeding days, duke John of\nBurgundy held a grand council in his town of Lille, on his own affairs,\nand on the means of reconciling his brother and brother-in-law, the\nduke of Brabant and duke William of Holland, who had quarrelled for a\ncause before mentioned.\n\nWith these two dukes, there were also present the duke of Burgundy\u2019s\nsister, the wife of duke William, the bishop of Liege, and the count\nde Namur. At length, the duke of Burgundy made peace between them, on\ncondition that duke William should pay to the duke of Brabant, for all\nhis demand of debt, the sum of seventy thousand golden florins of the\ncoin of France, by different instalments.\n\nWhen this had been settled, the duke of Burgundy went, about the\nmiddle of August, to Paris, by orders from the king and royal council:\nhe was accompanied by many men at arms, whom he quartered in the\nvillages round Paris. The reason why he was attended by such a force\nwas, because the duke of Brittany had lately brought from England\ngreat numbers of English, and, in conjunction with his Bretons, was\ncarrying on a sharp war against the old countess of Penthievre[36]\nand her lands. The queen of France and the king\u2019s ministers were much\ndispleased at this conduct of the duke of Brittany, because it was to\nthe prejudice of the realm. The duke had increased this displeasure\nagainst him by having beaten and ill treated his duchess, daughter to\nthe king of France, for blaming him on account of his undertaking this\nwar.\n\nIt was therefore intended, that the duke of Burgundy should march the\nforces he had brought, attended by other princes and captains, against\nthe duke of Brittany, to conquer his country and oblige him to submit\nto the king. The duke of Burgundy was very desirous of succouring\nthe countess and her fair son, the count de Penthievre; but while the\npreparations were making, the duke of Brittany, informed by some of\nhis friends that he was in the ill graces of his mother in law, the\nqueen of France, and of those who governed the king, sent, by advice\nof his council, certain ambassadors to Paris, to offer to submit his\ndifferences with the countess de Penthievre to the king and council,\nwhich was at length accepted, through the interference of the king of\nNavarre.\n\nThe countess de Penthievre and her son were summoned to Paris, whither\nalso came the duke of Brittany, when, after some discussions, peace was\nmade between them.\n\nIn this same month, Isabella, the king of France\u2019s eldest daughter, and\ndowager queen of England, but wife to Charles duke of Orleans, died\nin childbed. The duke bitterly lamented her loss, but received some\nconsolation out of regard to the daughter she had brought him.\n\nThe patriarch of Alexandria, bishop of Carcassonne, succeeded Guy de\nRoye (whose murder has been noticed) in the archbishoprick of Rheims,\nand the archbishop of Bourges succeeded to the patriarchate. Doctor\nWilliam Bouratier, secretary to the king, was nominated archbishop\nof Bourges; and nearly about this time died doctor Peter Paoul, and\nwas succeeded in his dignities by doctor Gilles des Champs, almoner\nto the king. Louis de Harcourt, brother to the count de Harcourt, was\nappointed archbishop of Rouen.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XII.\n\n    THE TOWN OF GENOA REBELS AGAINST BOUCICAUT, MARSHAL OF FRANCE,\n    THE GOVERNOR, WHILE OBEYING A SUMMONS FROM THE DUKE OF MILAN.\n\n\nBoucicaut, marshal of France, was at this time governor of Genoa, and\nresided there. He was called upon by the duke of Milan and his brother,\nthe count of Pavia[37], to settle a dispute which had arisen between\nthem, respecting part of their dominions. He accepted the invitation,\nthinking he should do an agreeable service to the duke of Milan, and\nnot suspecting any trick in the matter. But during his absence, the\ninhabitants of Genoa rebelled against his government, and sent for some\nof their allies and accomplices to come to them.\n\nThey cruelly murdered the marshal\u2019s lieutenant, the chevalier de\nColletrie, named Chollette, a native of Auvergne, which the other\nFrenchmen hearing of, fled into the forts, for fear of suffering a\nsimilar fate. These were instantly besieged by the Genoese, who sent\nfor the marquis of Montferrat[38]: he lost no time in hastening to\ntheir aid with four thousand combatants, as they had promised to pay\nhim ten thousand florins yearly,--and they immediately elected him doge\nof Genoa. They also chose twelve knights, as a council to manage public\naffairs.\n\nA few days after, Fassincault[39], a very renowned captain in Italy,\nand a great friend of the marquis of Montferrat, came to Genoa with\nthe intent of assisting the marquis; but the Genoese refused to admit\nhim, or accept of his offers. On his return, his force, amounting\nto eight thousand men, took a town called Noefville; but the French\nretreated within the castle, which was instantly besieged.\n\nWhen Boucicaut heard of the rebellion of the Genoese, he set out\naccompanied by his men, and the duke of Milan and the count of Pavia,\nand arrived with speed at the castle of Gaing[40], situated between the\ntown of Noefville[41] and Genoa, and fought with Fassincault and his\nforces. In this battle, eight hundred men were slain, the greater part\nbelonging to Fassincault,--and night alone separated the combatants.\n\nBoucicaut, by the advice of Enguerrand de Bournouville and Gaiffier\nde la Salle, both men at arms of acknowledged prowess, advanced that\nnight to the castle of Gaing, which he won, and amply provided it with\nprovision and all necessary stores. Fassincault remained in the town;\nbut seeing he could not gain the castle, he departed with his men to\nhis own fortresses.\n\nThe marshal Boucicaut carried on a severe warfare against the Genoese\nand those who had assisted them. He also sent messengers to inform\nthe king of France of his situation, and to require that he would\nimmediately send him reinforcements of men at arms.--The king and his\ngreat council, on receiving this intelligence and considering the\nfickleness of the Genoese, determined to proceed cautiously against\nthem. The king sent, at his expense, the lords de Torsy, de Rambures,\nand de Viefville, with a certain number of men at arms, to the city of\nAsti, belonging to the duke of Orleans, and near to the territory of\nGenoa, with the hope of affording assistance to Boucicaut.\n\nOn their arrival at Asti, they found that the whole country was in\nrebellion, excepting some forts, which held out for the French; but as\nthey were without the town, and could not contain many men, from dread\nof wanting provision, they were not of consequence, nor could they do\nmuch mischief. The above knights, therefore, perceiving they could not\nperform any essential services, resolved to return to France.\n\nAll merchants, and others who came from or had any connexions with\nGenoa, were now sought after in Paris, arrested and imprisoned, and\ntheir goods confiscated to the king\u2019s use. Now these Genoese had for a\nlong time been under obedience to the king, and had diligently served\nhim in many of his wars.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XIII.\n\n    THE PRINCES OF THE BLOOD ASSEMBLE, AND RESOLVE TO REFORM THE\n    MANAGEMENT OF THE ROYAL FINANCES.--THE DEATH OF MONTAGU.\n\n\nAt this period, the following princes of the blood,--Louis king of\nNavarre[42], the dukes of Berry, Burgundy, and Bourbon, and many other\ngreat lords, were at Paris; and having learnt that the king\u2019s treasury\nwas impoverished by his officers and those who governed him, insomuch\nthat his plate and the greater part of his jewels were in pawn, they\none day personally explained to the king, in the presence of the queen,\nthe duke of Acquitaine and others of his council, the miserable state\nof his finances, and the unworthy government of the officers of his\nhousehold. They at the same time requested, that he would be pleased\nto permit that some of them should have power to reform in general the\nabuses that had commenced with his reign, and to call to an account,\ndismiss, and punish all who should have mismanaged the finances,\naccording as the cases might require, without any exception whatever.\n\nThis request the king granted; and for the better carrying on their\nobject, the greater part of the lords before mentioned left their\nown h\u00f4tels, and resided in the king\u2019s palace of St Pol, where, with\nthe advice of the members of the parliament and the university, they\ncontinued their reformations for many days.\n\nThey soon discovered that those who had managed the finances for the\nlast sixteen or twenty years had very dishonestly acquitted themselves,\nand had acquired for themselves and their friends immense fortunes,\nto the prejudice of the state. Montagu, who had been the principal\nminister of finance, was particularly the object they aimed at,--and\nthey ordered him, with several others, to be arrested and confined in\nthe prisons of the Ch\u00e2telet.\n\nSir Peter des Essars, provost of Paris, was directed to put this order\ninto execution, with his sergeants; and by the command of the duke of\nBurgundy, the lords de Heylly, de Robais, and sir Roland de Vequerque,\nwere appointed to assist the provost in this duty. Having assembled\ntogether, they, on a certain day, met Montagu, and with him the doctor,\nMartin Gouge, bishop of Chartres, both going to hear mass at the\nmonastery of St Victor.\n\nThe provost, attended by the above lords, on meeting them, laid his\nhands on both, saying, \u2018I lay hands on you by virtue of the royal\nauthority vested in me for this purpose.\u2019--Montagu, hearing these\nwords, was much astonished, and trembled greatly; but his courage soon\nreturned, and he replied to the provost, \u2018What! rascal, art thou daring\nenough to lay hands on me?\u2019 But the provost answered, \u2018Matters will\nnot turn out as you think,--for you must make reparation for the many\nand great mischiefs you have done.\u2019\n\nMontagu, unable to resist, was tightly bound by the provost, and\ncarried by him straight to the little Ch\u00e2telet. The bishop of Chartres\nwas arrested with him, as he had been president of one of the financial\ndepartments. Montagu was several times put to the torture, insomuch\nthat, suspecting his end was approaching, he asked his confessor what\nhe had best do: the confessor replied, \u2018I see no other remedy than your\nappealing from the jurisdiction of the provost of Paris.\u2019 This he did;\nand the provost waited on the lords who had commanded him to arrest\nMontagu, to inform them, that he had appealed against his jurisdiction.\nThe parliament was consequently convoked to examine into the matter;\nand the members of it declared the appeal of no effect. The lords,\ntherefore, seeing the cause had been judged, said to the provost, \u2018Go,\nwithout delay, accompanied by some of the populace well armed, take thy\nprisoner, and finish the matter by cutting off his head with an axe,\nand fix it on a lance in the market-place.\u2019\n\nAfter these words, the populace armed themselves, and, on the 17th\nof October, assembled in bodies in the place Maubert, and in other\nparts of the town. They carried Montagu to a scaffold erected in the\nmarket place, where, having made him strip to his shirt, they cut off\nhis head, and fixed it to the end of a pike, and hung his body by the\nshoulders to the highest gibbet at Montfaucon. This execution was\nchiefly owing, as it was said, to the duke of Burgundy\u2019s hatred to him,\nwho even sent for a very great number of the nobles of his countries of\nBurgundy, Flanders, and Artois, to be spectators of it.\n\nA little before this execution took place, the duke of Bourbon, and\nhis son the count de Clermont, left Paris, indignant at the arrest of\nMontagu. The duke of Orleans, his brothers, and all of their party,\nwere also very much displeased that he was put to death,--but they\ncould not help it, for at that time they were not listened to by the\nking\u2019s council.\n\nOn the morrow of this event, duke William count of Hainault arrived at\nParis, having been sent for by the duke of Burgundy. A large company of\nthe nobles went out of the town to meet him; and he was most graciously\nreceived by the king, the duke of Acquitaine and the other princes. On\nhis arrival, the h\u00f4tel that had belonged to Montagu was given to him,\nwith all its furniture, for it had been confiscated to the king\u2019s use;\nand duke William took instant possession.\n\nThe castle of Marcoussi, which had been built by Montagu, was seized\nby the king: it is situated seven leagues from Paris, on the road to\nChartres. Montagu was born in Paris, and had first been secretary\nto the king: he was the son of Gerard de Montagu, who had also been\nsecretary to Charles V. He was of noble birth by his mother\u2019s side, and\nhad three daughters, two of whom were married; the elder to John[43]\ncount de Roussy, the second to Peter de Craon, lord of Montbason;\nand the third was betrothed to John de Melun, son to the lord\nd\u2019Antoing[44], but the match was broken off: his son was married to the\ndaughter of the lord d\u2019Albret, constable of France and cousin to the\nking, as has been related.\n\nAfter this, the provost of Paris arrested many of the king\u2019s officers,\nparticularly those who had been concerned in the finances and in\nmatters of revenue. All the principals in the department of the\ngeneralities, the presidents and others of the chamber of accounts,\nPerrin Pillot, a merchant, with several others, were imprisoned in the\nLouvre and in other places of confinement.\n\nWhen the borgne de Foucal, equerry to the king, and keeper of that\ndepartment of the treasury called the Epargne, heard that the grand\nmaster of the household was arrested, he was greatly astonished and\ntroubled, and, instantly changing his dress, mounted a fleet horse, and\nsecretly left Paris. This caused him to be much suspected of improper\nconduct by the princes who were examining into these matters.\n\nAt this period, the archbishop of Sens, brother to the grand master,\nGuichart Daulphin, William de Tignonville, knights, and master Goutier\nCol, secretary to the king, were sent, by orders from the king, to meet\nthe english ambassadors at Amiens. The archbishop, hearing of the\narrest and imprisonment of his brother, took leave of his companions,\nand set out from Amiens: but as he was journeying toward Paris, he was\nmet by one of the king\u2019s ushers, who made him his prisoner; for he had\norders so to do from the king, and confine him at Amiens, should he\nchance to find him there.\n\nThe archbishop very prudently replied, that he was ready to follow him\nto prison or to death; but when they came to the river Oise, near the\npriory of St Leu de Cherens, he played the usher a trick. On leaving\nthe ferry boat with a few of his people, he mounted the fleetest of his\nhorses, and galloped off, leaving the usher on the other side waiting\nfor the return of the ferry-boat; but, thunderstruck at his being so\ncheated, he returned to Paris without his prisoner.\n\nThe lord de Tignonville, having been a member of the chamber of\naccounts, was, by command of the princes, arrested by the bailiff of\nAmiens, and confined in his prison. But after a short time, he, the\nbishop of Chartres, and the other prisoners at Paris, were suspended\nfrom their offices, and, having given bail, were permitted to go about\nParis, or wherever they pleased.\n\nThe princes, not being able to attend sufficiently to these matters\nof reform from their other occupations of greater weight, appointed\na commission to examine carefully into them, which commission was\ncomposed of the counts de la Marche, de Vend\u00f4me and de St Pol, with\nsome members of the parliament.\n\nThe men at arms that had been called together round Paris by the duke\nof Burgundy and others were disbanded; and each, as they returned to\nthe places whence they had come, devoured the substance of the poor\npeople, according to the custom of that time.\n\nSir Guichart Daulphin[45], before mentioned, was, by the princes,\nappointed grand master of the king\u2019s household in the room of the\nmurdered Montagu; for the king was then troubled with his usual\ndisorder.\n\nThe bishop of Paris now requested of the princes, that they would, in\ntheir mercy, permit him to have the body of his brother taken down from\nthe gibbet, and, with many tears and supplications, petitioned for\nleave to bury him. But neither of these requests was granted him by the\nprinces; on which the bishop, ashamed of the disgraceful death of one\nbrother and the flight of another, the archbishop of Sens, soon after\nquitted his see, and taking with him his sister-in-law, the widow of\nMontagu, and some of their children, for the duke of Berry had already\nappointed another chancellor, went to the estate of his sister-in-law\nin Savoy: she was the daughter of sir Stephen de la Grange, formerly\npresident of the parliament, and brother to the cardinal d\u2019Amiens.\n\nThe borgne de Foucal, not answering to the proclamations that were\nmade for his appearance, was banished the realm of France, by sound\nof trumpet in the four quarters of Paris. In like manner were the\narchbishop of Sens and many other fugitives banished the kingdom.\n\nThe king of Navarre, the dukes of Berry, Burgundy and Holland, with the\ncounts de Vend\u00f4me and de la Marche, and several great lords, waited on\nthe queen of France and the duke of Acquitaine, to make them acquainted\nwith the reasons for the executing Montagu, and what progress they had\nmade in the reformation of abuses, and the measures they had pursued\nagainst such as were criminal. The queen testified her satisfaction,\nand was contented that they should proceed as they had began. She was,\nhowever, far from being pleased with the duke of Burgundy, whom she\ndreaded, from the great power he was now possessed of, more than any of\nthe other princes, although he treated her respectfully in his speech.\n\nThe marriage of the lord Louis of Bavaria, brother to the queen, was\nagain talked of with the daughter of the king of Navarre; and he was\npresented with the castle of Marcoussi, with all its furniture and\nappurtenances, which had lately been confiscated to the king, by the\ndeath of Montagu, which was very agreeable to the queen.\n\nAfter these lords had for some days transacted business at Melun, where\nthe court was, they all returned to Paris, carrying with them master\nPeter Bosthet, president of the parliament, and some members of the\nchamber of accounts, and assembled daily to inquire after those persons\nwho had been in the receipt and expenditure of the public revenues.\n\nDuring this time, the king, who had been very ill, was restored\nto health, insomuch that on the 2d day of December, he rode from\nhis palace of St Pol, dressed in a hauberk under his robes, to the\ncathedral church of N\u00f4tre Dame, where he made his prayers, a page\ncarrying behind him a very handsome steel helmet and a moorish lance.\nHaving finished his prayers, he returned to his palace of Saint Pol.\n\nOn the morrow, he held a royal council in person, at which were present\nthe king of Navarre, the dukes of Berry, Burgundy, and of Bourbon,\nwhich last was lately returned to Paris. It was there resolved, that\nthe king should summon the following lords to attend him personally\nat the ensuing feast of Christmas, namely, the dukes of Orleans, of\nBrittany, of Brabant, of Bar, and of Lorraine: the counts of Savoy[46],\nof Alen\u00e7on, of Penthievre, of Namur, of Harcourt, of Armagnac[47],\nand in general all the great lords within his realm of France and\nDauphiny, with many prelates and other noblemen. After this summons of\nthe king, the duke of Burgundy gave orders for a large body of men at\narms to be collected in his countries of Flanders, Artois and Burgundy,\nfor the safety of his person.\n\nShortly after this council, duke William count of Hainault went to\nMelun, the residence of the queen of France, who was his near relation;\nand so managed that she, who could not bear the duke of Burgundy, and\nhad strongly supported the party adverse to him, namely, that of my\nlord the duke of Orleans, was reconciled to him.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XIV.\n\n    DUKE LOUIS OF BAVARIA ESPOUSES THE DAUGHTER OF THE KING OF\n    NAVARRE.--THE NAMES OF THE LORDS WHO CAME TO PARIS IN OBEDIENCE\n    TO THE KING\u2019S ORDERS.\n\n\nAbout this time, duke Louis of Bavaria was married at Melun to the\ndaughter of the king of Navarre, according to what has been before\nmentioned. She had previously married the eldest son of the king of\nArragon[48], who had lately been slain in a battle between him and the\nviscount de Narbonne and the Sardinians, which took place in Sardinia.\nThere was much feasting at this wedding, which was attended by many\nlords, ladies and damsels.\n\nAbout Christmas the greater part of those lords whom the king had\nsummoned, arrived at Paris: the duke of Orleans and his brothers,\nhowever, did not come. On the eve of Christmas-day, the king went to\nthe palace to hold his state, and remained there until St Thomas\u2019s day,\nwhere he celebrated most solemnly the feast of the nativity of our Lord.\n\nOn this day the following persons were seated at the king\u2019s table at\ndinner: on his right, doctor William Bouratier, archbishop of Bourges,\nwho had said the mass, next to him was the cardinal de Bar. The king\nwas seated at the middle of the table, very magnificently dressed in\nhis royal robes. On his left were the dukes of Berry and Burgundy. A\ngreat variety of ornamental plate was produced in gold and silver,\nwhich were wont to be served before the king on high feasts, but which\nhad not for some time been seen, because they had been pawned to\nMontagu, and had been found after his death in his castle of Marcoussi,\nand in other places where he had hidden them.\n\nBy orders from the princes of the blood they had been replaced, as\nusual, in the king\u2019s palace, which was a very agreeable sight to the\nnobles and people of Paris, from their regard to the honour of the\nking\u2019s person, and his royal state.\n\nA great many princes and others had obeyed the king\u2019s summons, and\nwere at this feast,--namely, the king of Navarre, the dukes of Berry,\nBurgundy, Bourbon, Brabant, duke William count of Hainault, the duke of\nLorraine, duke Louis of Bavaria, brother to the queen,--and nineteen\ncounts, namely, the count de Mortain, brother to the king of Navarre,\nthe count de Nevers, the count de Clermont, the marquis du Pont, son\nto the duke of Bar, the count de Vaudemont, the count d\u2019Alen\u00e7on, the\ncount de Vend\u00f4me, the count de Penthievre, the count de St Pol, the\ncount de Cleves, the count de Tancarville, the count d\u2019Angy[49], the\ncount de Namur, and several others, to the aforesaid amount. The number\nof knights who accompanied these princes was so great that, from the\nreport of the heralds, they were more than eighteen hundred knights,\nwithout including esquires.\n\nNevertheless, there were not in this noble company the duke of Orleans\nnor his brothers, nor the duke of Brittany, nor the lord d\u2019Albret,\nconstable of France, nor the counts de Foix, d\u2019Armagnac, and many other\npotent lords, although they had been summoned by the king in like\nmanner as the others.\n\nOn St Thomas\u2019s day, after the king had feasted his nobles in royal\nstate, the queen, by orders from the king, came from the castle of\nVincennes to Paris. All the princes, prelates, and great crowds of\npeople, went out to meet her and her son, the duke of Acquitaine, and\nconducted her to the palace, where they presented her to the king, in\nthe presence of all the before-mentioned lords. Her son had visited\nhis government, to be properly instructed in arms, and other necessary\nmatters, that he might be the better qualified to rule his kingdom when\nit should fall to him.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XV.\n\n    THE KING OF FRANCE KEEPS ROYAL STATE IN HIS PALACE, WHEREIN\n    SEVERAL OF THE GREAT LORDS BEFORE MENTIONED HOLD MANY COUNCILS\n    ON THE STATE OF THE NATION.\n\n\nIn consequence of several meetings having been held in the presence of\nthe king, queen, and duke of Acquitaine, the king ordered the great\nhall of the palace to be magnificently prepared for a royal sessions.\nThither were summoned all the principal noblemen, prelates and others,\nwhen the king appeared seated in his regal robes. On one side of him\nwere the king of Navarre and the cardinal de Bar, and on the other\nthe duke of Acquitaine, the duke of Berry, and all the other princes\nand nobles, each seated according to his rank: in like manner were\nthe prelates, knights, and clergy, and a multitude of others, seated\naccording to their respective situations in life.\n\nThen, by the king\u2019s commands, the count de Tancarville, an able and\neloquent man, harangued with a loud and clear voice, how Richard\nlate king of England, and son-in-law to the king, had been basely and\ntreacherously put to death, during the time of a truce, by Henry of\nLancaster, calling himself king of England, but then earl of Derby, in\nconjunction with his partisans, as might be fully proved by several of\nthe English, near relations of the deceased king Richard:--And also how\nthe young prince of Scotland, an ally to the king, when on his voyage\nto France, was taken by this same Henry, and detained his prisoner for\na long time; as were likewise many Scots, who were in the company of\nthe prince of Wales. Yvain Graindos[50], with several of his Welshmen,\nallies also to the king, notwithstanding the aforesaid truce, were by\nthe English harrassed with war. The eldest son likewise to the prince\nof Wales was made captive[51], carried to England, and imprisoned by\nHenry for a considerable time.\n\n\u2018In consequence of the facts above stated, the king thinks he may,\nwithout further consideration, lawfully wage war against the said\nHenry and his english subjects, without giving them any respite.\nNotwithstanding this,\u2019 continued the orator, \u2018the king is desirous that\nwhatever he may please to order should be for the common welfare of the\nstate; and for this purpose a royal sessions has been held, for every\none to consider these matters and what ought to be the line of conduct\nfor him to pursue,--and, having an opinion thereon, if they will inform\nthe king or his council thereof, the king will thank them and follow\nthat advice which shall seem to him the most advantageous for the\ngeneral good.\n\nUpon this, the eldest of the princes of the blood, namely, the king\u2019s\nuncle the duke of Berry, arose from his seat, and, advancing in front\nof the king\u2019s throne, fell on his knees, and, speaking for himself and\nthe other princes of the blood, declared they would relinquish, to the\nuse of the state, all taxes and impositions which they annually levied\non their lands,--and in like manner would they relinquish all the fees\nand perquisites of office which they were in the habit of receiving\nfrom their places under the king, and as the members of his council.\n\nThe king kindly listened to the duke\u2019s speech, and accepted his offers,\nand then commanded him to be reseated. The lord Tancarville continued\nhis harangue, saying, that the king, then present, revoked all pensions\nand grants which he had given, and thus publicly annulled them. In\nregard to the reformation and future management of the finances, the\nking declared his intention that such regulations as should be ordered\nby himself, and by the advice of the count de la Marche (who had now\nlost his wife, the daughter of the king of Navarre), his brother the\ncount de Vend\u00f4me, the count de Saint Pol, and the other commissioners\nfrom the parliament, should be fully executed without excepting any\nperson whatever; and that the reformations by them proposed should take\nplace, as well in the chambers of accounts as in the generalities and\nin the household of the king,--and that all receivers, comptrollers,\nand all persons any way interested in the management of the finances\nof the realm, whether bishops or archbishops, and of what rank soever,\nshould be subjected to them.\u2019 The orator continued,--\u2018That the king\nwilled and ordered, that during his absence, the queen should call\nto her assistance some of the princes of the royal blood, and should\ngovern the affairs of this kingdom according as she might judge most\nconducive to its welfare; and in case of the absence of the queen, the\nduke of Acquitaine, his son, then present, should govern the kingdom,\nwith the assistance of the dukes of Berry and Burgundy.\u2019\n\nWhen the lord de Tancarville had more fully enlarged on the above\nmatters, and concluded his speech, the king descended from his royal\nthrone, and, with a small company, entered his apartment to dinner; and\nthe whole assembly broke up, and departed to their h\u00f4tels.\n\nAfter the dinner, the queen set out with her attendants for the castle\nof Vincennes, as it was the eve of the feast of the Circumcision, but\nleft her son with the king. On the morrow, the feast-day, the duke of\nBurgundy (who had alone more princes, knights, and gentlemen attached\nto him than all the other princes together,) gave presents of jewels\nand rich gifts, of greater magnificence than any one, according to the\ncustom of that day. He made presents to all the knights and nobles of\nhis household, to the amount, as was estimated, of fifteen thousand\ngolden florins, of medals formed like to a mason\u2019s level, of gold and\nsilver gilt; and at the pointed ends of these levels was fastened a\nsmall gilt chain, with a plummet of gold, so that it might be used as a\nrule.\n\nItem, on Twelfth-day following, Louis king of Sicily, having been sent\nfor by the king, entered Paris. He came from the city of Pisa, whither\nhe had gone to visit pope Alexander V. and made his entry, attended by\nnumbers of the nobility and clergy, who had gone out to meet him.\n\nShortly after, the cardinal de Thurey came to Paris, as ambassador from\nthe pope to the king, who most honourably received him, as he likewise\ndid Philibert de Lignac, grand master of Rhodes, and chief of the order\nof St John of Jerusalem, who had come from England.\n\nThe king now disbanded all the troops he had collected, as did the duke\nof Burgundy, excepting about one hundred or six score gentlemen, whom\nhe retained, with those of his household, to guard his person: the\nothers returned to their homes.\n\nBefore the duke of Burgundy left Paris, the duke of Acquitaine, with\nthe consent of the king and queen, was intrusted to his care and\nguardianship, that he might be properly instructed in the arts of war\nand government. He had been very anxious to obtain this, and had caused\nseveral of the princes of the blood to press the matter: even his\nuncle, the duke of Berry, had, on this account, more than once refused\nthe queen to accept of the guardianship of the duke of Acquitaine;\nbut had so urged the business that the lord de Dolhaing[52], knight,\nhis principal esquire, counsellor and advocate, had, by the earnest\ndesire of the queen, been made chancellor to the duke of Acquitaine,\nand the lord de Saint George his first chamberlain. The government\nof the castles of Crotoy and Beaurain-sur-Canche were granted to the\nduke of Berry for his life, on giving the preceding governors the\nusual pension, in whose room he appointed two of his own knights; the\nlord de Croy to Crotoy, and the lord de Humbercourt to Beaurain; and\nsir Reginald Pot was, at his request, appointed governor of Dauphiny\nfor the dauphin. Soon after this, the king relapsed into his usual\ndisorder, and was put under good guard. Those who were intrusted with\nthe reform of abuses continued daily at work, and with such success\nthat large sums were recovered from the late directors of the finances.\n\nAt this period, the princes and council of state went often to the\ncastle of Vincennes, where the queen resided,--for without her\nknowledge no business of any importance was carried on. The dukes of\nBerry and Bourbon, however, were much discontented that they were not\nso often summoned to the council as before, and that their authority\nwas greatly lessened. Seeing themselves, as it were, banished from the\ngovernment, they took leave of the king, queen, and princes, and each\nretired to his own domains.\n\nThe cardinal de Thurey had come to Paris to solicit the university\nand council of state to consent that pope Alexander might levy\ntwo-tenths on the gallican church, to defray the great expenses he was\nbound to pay. This request was not granted, because the university\nopposed it, in the name of the whole church. The better to effect\nthis, the university required and obtained a royal mandate, to\ncommand all officers under the crown forcibly to send out of their\njurisdictions all persons who should come thither making similar\ndemands. The solicitors of this levy had brought to Paris with them\na bull containing many novelties, which were not usually advanced,\nnamely, that the tythes, and other things, such as oblations to the\nchurch, belonged to them in preference to the parochial clergy, for\nthat in fact they were in the same capacity, inasmuch as whoever should\nconfess themselves to them were not under the necessity of so doing to\ntheir own clergyman. This doctrine they publicly preached throughout\nParis, and the members of the university preached in opposition to it,\nso that during Lent the whole town was in confusion and discord by\nthese quarrels of the university and the mendicants, until they were\ndriven out of it by the university. The Jacobins, however, as the most\nprudent, renounced the bull, and made oath that they would never claim\nany advantages from it, nor from other privileges that had been granted\nto them. By this means, they were reconciled to the university. The\npope, at this period, held his court with great state in Bologna la\nGrassa.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XVI.\n\n    A GREAT DISSENSION TAKES PLACE THIS YEAR BETWEEN THE KING OF\n    POLAND, ON THE ONE HAND, AND THE GRAND MASTER OF PRUSSIA AND\n    HIS KNIGHTS ON THE OTHER.\n\n\nThis year, a great quarrel arose between the king of Poland and the\ngrand master of the Teutonic order in Prussia; and the king assembled a\nlarge force from different nations, which he marched into Prussia, with\nthe intent to destroy it.\n\nThe grand master and his brethren soon made themselves ready to meet\nhim with a great army, and showed every inclination to give him battle;\nbut when the two armies were in sight of each other, through the will\nof God, the king of Poland retreated with his forces, among which were\ntwenty thousand Tartars at least, without counting his Polanders and\nothers his Christian allies, who were very numerous, and returned to\nhis own country.\n\nAfterward, the king of Lithuania, by the exhortations of the king of\nPoland, invaded Prussia with an immense army, and destroyed the greater\npart which lay on the sea-shores. The Prussians made a thousand of them\nprisoners, and slew many.\n\nThe king of Poland was formerly an infidel, and son to the king of\nLithuania, but, having a great ambition to reign, murdered his father,\nand was for this crime banished the country. He took refuge with the\nthen king of Poland, who received him kindly, and admitted him into his\nfriendship and confidence. He also gained the affections of the princes\nand nobles, insomuch that, on the death of their king, they unanimously\nelected this parricide to succeed him, had him baptised, and married\nhim to the widow of the late king; and, since that time, he has happily\nenough governed that kingdom[53].\n\nAt this period, Sigismond king of Hungary, brother to the king of\nBohemia, took to wife the sister of the above queen of Poland: they\nwere daughters to a german count, called the count de Cilly, of the\nroyal branch of Hungary[54]. The king of Poland laid claim to Hungary\nin right of his wife, and thence took occasion to harrass that country\nas well as Prussia. He sent secret messengers to the king of Lithuania,\nhis cousin german and ally, to press him to invade Prussia on the\nquarter nearest the sea, when he would march his Polanders to form a\njunction and destroy the whole of it. His intentions were discovered\nby the messenger being arrested by orders of the king of Hungary, and\ninformation sent of them to Prussia, whenceforward the king of Hungary\nand grand master took such wise precautions that his future attempts\nwere fruitless.\n\n\n\n\n[A. D. 1410.]\n\nCHAP. XVII.\n\n    THE DUKE OF BERRY, BY THE KING\u2019S COMMANDS, RETURNS TO\n    PARIS.--THE MARRIAGE OF THE SON OF THE KING OF SICILY.--THE\n    ASSEMBLY THAT IS HOLDEN AT MEUN LE CHASTEL.\n\n\nThis year, the duke of Berry was, by the king\u2019s orders, remanded to\nParis, and, on his arrival, was sent, with the king of Navarre, to\nGiens sur Loire, to put an end to the quarrels between the duke of\nBrittany and the count and countess of Penthievre. Although both\nparties had promised to meet them, they did not personally attend, but\nsent commissioners.\n\nThe king of Navarre and the duke of Berry took great pains, and\nproposed various means, to bring about a reconciliation. Finding all\ntheir attempts fruitless, they referred the whole matter, with the\nconsent of the commissioners, to the king\u2019s decision on All-saints-day\nnext coming, and then they returned to Paris.\n\nIn this year was concluded the marriage between the eldest son of Louis\nking of Sicily, and Catherine, daughter to the duke of Burgundy. The\nlady was conducted by sir John de Ch\u00e2lons, lord de Darlay, the lord de\nSt George, sir William de Champdivers, and sir James de Courtjambe, to\nAngers, and there delivered to the queen of Sicily, who received her\nmost affectionately and honourably,--and she magnificently entertained\nthe knights who had brought her. After a short stay at Angers, they\nreturned to their lord, the duke of Burgundy, at Paris.\n\nAt this time, the dukes of Orleans and Bourbon, the counts de Clermont,\nd\u2019Alen\u00e7on, d\u2019Armagnac, the lord Charles d\u2019Albreth, constable, and many\nother lords of great power and authority, held a meeting in the town\nof Meun le Ch\u00e2tel,--where they had several long consultations with\neach other on the state of public affairs, and particularly as to the\nmurder of the late duke of Orleans, principally to consider how they\nshould proceed to take vengeance on the person who had committed it.\nMany different opinions were urged: one was, that the duke of Orleans\nshould declare a deadly war against him, and carry it on by every\npossible means, with the assistance of his relations, friends, and the\nwellwishers to his cause.\n\nOthers said, it would be better to follow another course, and\nremonstrate strongly to the king, their sovereign lord, on the\nnecessity he was under to do strict justice on the duke of Burgundy,\nto which he was the more particularly bound, as the murder was\ncommitted on his own brother. But, as they could not all agree in the\nsame opinion, they broke up the meeting, and appointed another day to\nassemble again.\n\nBefore they separated, a treaty of marriage was entered upon between\nCharles duke of Orleans and the daughter of the count d\u2019Armagnac. She\nwas niece to the duke of Berry by her mother\u2019s side, and sister[55]\nto the count de Savoye. This done, the lords departed for their own\ndomains.\n\nThe duke of Burgundy resided in Paris, and ruled there more\ndespotically than any other of the princes: affairs were solely carried\non by him and his partisans, which, no doubt, made very many jealous of\nhim.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XVIII.\n\n    THE KING OF SICILY GOES TO PROVENCE AND TO BOLOGNA, TO MEET HIS\n    RIVAL KING LADISLAUS.--THE DEATH OF POPE ALEXANDER, AND THE\n    ELECTION OF POPE JOHN.\n\n\nAbout this period, Louis king of Sicily set out from Paris with a\nnumerous body of men at arms, and went for Provence, and thence to\nBologna, to meet king Ladislaus, his opponent, and to defend his\nkingdom of Naples, where his rival was committing great devastation.\nKing Louis had for this raised so considerable a force, that he might\nbe enabled to offer him combat; and he had also the hope that pope\nAlexander would assist him, to the utmost of his ability, in money and\nin men.\n\nAn end was soon put to his expectations in this respect; for, on the\nmorrow of the feast of the discovery of the holy cross, pope Alexander\nwas poisoned in the town of Bologna, as was currently reported, and\ndied most pitifully. His bowels were interred, and his obsequies were\nperformed in the church of the Cordeliers. Mass was celebrated by the\ncardinal de Vimers: the deacon and under deacon were the cardinals\nd\u2019Espaigne and de Thurey. The whole court was dressed in deep mourning.\n\nThe 6th of May, the corpse of the pope, having been embalmed with fine\nspices, was placed in the hall of audience, dressed in his papal robes,\nhis face uncovered, gloves on his hands, but his feet naked, so that\nwhoever pleased might kiss them,--and nine funeral services were there\nperformed.\n\nThere were present twenty cardinals, two patriarchs, four archbishops,\ntwenty-four bishops, with many prelates, abbots, and other churchmen.\nHis escutcheon of arms were placed at the four corners of his coffin;\nand for nine days, masses were celebrated in the same manner as on the\nmorrow of his death. The masses were said by the cardinals in rotation;\nand the ninth day, the body was carried to the Cordeliers for interment.\n\nThe two first bearers were the cardinals de Vimers and de Challant,\nand the two last the cardinals d\u2019Espaigne and de Thurey. The cardinal\nMilles preceded the body bearing a cross. The chorists were the\ncardinals de Bar, (not the son of the duke of Bar, but the cardinal of\nBar[56] in Calabria), and d\u2019Orsini. The cardinal de Vimers performed\nthe service, as he had done at the interment of the bowels.\n\nWhen this ceremony was over, the cardinals returned home dressed in\nblack; and after dinner, they assembled at the palace, and entered\ninto conclave, where they remained shut up from the Wednesday to the\nSaturday following. Some of the cardinals, having consulted together,\nproposed Balthazar, cardinal of Bologna, as sovereign pontiff of\nthe universal church; and the others, who were not of this opinion,\nseeing their numbers were very small, consented to it; and the new\npope was conducted by them to the church of St Peter, where they placed\nthe tiara on his head, and took the oaths of fidelity to him. They\nthen led him to the palace of his predecessor, where every piece of\nfurniture had been carried off, and there did not remain even a door or\nwindow-frame.\n\nOn the morrow, he took the name of pope John XXIII. and great were the\nrejoicings and feasts that ensued. In the procession were twenty-three\ncardinals, two patriarchs, three archbishops, twenty-seven abbots,\nmitred and non-mitred, without reckoning other churchmen, who were\nalmost numberless. The pope wore on that day a silver-gilt tiara bound\nwith white. The following Saturday, the 23d of May, the pope received,\nin the chapel of his predecessors, the holy order of priesthood, when\nthe cardinal de Vimers said the mass, and the cardinal de Challant was\ndeacon: at this service, all the before-named prelates attended.\n\nOn the following day, Sunday, the pope celebrated mass in the church\nof St Peter, having the cardinal de Vimers near him to show him the\nservice. The marquis of Ferrara and the lord of Malatesta were present,\nand held the bason wherein the pope washed his hands. The marquis of\nFerrara had brought with him fifty-four knights, all clothed in scarlet\nand blue, having five trumpets and four companies of minstrels, each\nplaying on a different instrument.\n\nWhen mass was finished, pope John was carried out of the church to a\nvery handsome platform erected without the porch, and there solemnly\ncrowned in the presence of all those whom I have mentioned, and a great\nmultitude of doctors and clergy.\n\nWhen seated on his throne, which was covered all over with cloth of\ngold, he was surrounded by the cardinals de Vimers, de Challant, de\nMilles, d\u2019Espaigne, de Thurey, and de Bar, having tufts of tow in their\nhands. The cardinals lighted their tufts; and as the flame was suddenly\nextinguished, they addressed the pope, saying, \u2018Thus, holy father,\npasses the glory of this world!\u2019 This was done three times.\n\nThe cardinal de Vimers having said some prayers over him and on the\ncrown, placed it upon his head. This crown was a triple one: the first\nof gold, which encircled the forehead within the mitre; the second\nof gold and silver, about the middle of the mitre; and the third, of\nvery fine gold, surmounted it. He was then led down from the platform,\nand placed on a horse covered over with scarlet furniture. The horses\nof the cardinals and bishops, &c. were caparisoned in white; and in\nthis state he was conducted from street to street, making every where\nthe sign of the cross, until he came to where the Jews resided, who\npresented him with a manuscript of the Old Testament. He took it with\nhis own hand, and, having examined it a little, threw it behind him,\nsaying, \u2018Your religion is good, but this of ours is better.\u2019\n\nAs he departed, the Jews followed him, intending to touch him,--in the\nattempt of which, the caparison of his horse was all torn.--Wherever\nhe passed, the pope distributed money,--that is to say, quadrini and\nmailles of Florence, with other coins. There were before and behind him\ntwo hundred men at arms, each having in his hand a leathern mallet,\nwith which they struck the Jews in such wise as it was a pleasure to\nsee.\n\nOn the morrow, he returned to his palace, accompanied by the cardinals\ndressed in crimson,--the patriarchs in like manner,--the archbishops\nand bishops in similar dresses, having white mitres on their heads,\nand numbers of mitred and non-mitred abbots. In this procession were,\nthe marquis of Ferrara[57], the lord Malatesta[58], the lord of\nGaucourt[59], and others, to the amount of forty-four, as well dukes as\ncounts and knights of Italy, all dressed out in their liveries. In each\nstreet, two and two by turns led the pope\u2019s horse by the bridle,--the\none on the right hand, and another on the left.\n\nThere were thirty-six bagpipes and trumpets, and ten bands of minstrels\nplaying on musical instruments, each band consisting of three\nperformers. There were also singers, especially those of the chapel of\nhis predecessor, as well as those belonging to the cardinals and from\ndifferent parts of Italy, who rode before the pope loudly chaunting\nvarious airs, sacred and profane.\n\nWhen he arrived at the palace, he gave his peace to all the cardinals,\nwho, according to their rank in the college, kissed his foot, hand, or\nmouth. The cardinal de Vimers first performed the ceremony, and was\nfollowed by the other cardinals, patriarchs, archbishops, bishops,\nabbots and clergy. He then gave his benediction to the four elements,\nand to all persons in a state of grace, as well to those absent as\npresent, and bestowed his dispensations for four months to come,\nprovided that, during this time, three Pater-nosters should be said by\neach in praying for his predecessor, pope Alexander.\n\nPope John then went to dinner, as it was now about twelve o\u2019clock, and\nthis ceremony had commenced between five and six in the morning.\n\nIn honour of him, feasts were continued at Bologna for the space\nof eight days; and on each of them very handsome processions were\nmade round St Peter\u2019s church, when the prelates were all dressed\nin vermilion robes, with copes of the same. In like manner did the\nCarthusians of St Michael\u2019s Mount, without the walls of Bologna.\n\nThe next day, the 25th of May, pope John held a consistory, in the\npresence of the cardinals, patriarchs, archbishops, bishops, and\npresented to the marquis of Ferrara and the italian heralds, many and\nvarious rich gifts. This was followed by a great feast, with dancing\nand music. The ensuing day, the pope revoked all that his predecessor\nhad done, excepting what he had confirmed, or what had been taken\ncorporal or spiritual possession of.\n\nKing Louis of Sicily arrived at Bologna the Friday after the coronation\nof the pope, and twenty-two cardinals, two patriarchs, six archbishops,\ntwenty bishops and eighteen abbots, handsomely equipped, went out of\nthe city to meet him: on his entrance, he went directly to the pope. He\nwas clothed in scarlet, and his horse\u2019s furniture was ornamented with\nsmall gilt bells: he was attended by about fifty knights dressed in his\nuniform. It was the last day of May that the king arrived,--and he was\nmost graciously received by the pope.\n\nThe ensuing day, the Florentines came to pay their duty and reverence\nto the holy father. They were about three hundred horse, among whom\nwere eighteen knights dressed in scarlet, with feathers bespangled\nwith gold. They were attended by six trumpets, two heralds, and ten\nmusicians playing on different instruments. When they had made their\nreverence to the pope, they returned to their h\u00f4tels, and the next\nday went to court. By reason of their alliance with king Louis, they\nsupplicated the pope to give him assistance against his adversary king\nLadislaus, adding, that they intended affording him every aid in their\npower of men and money. These Florentines were very indignant at the\nlate conduct of the Genoese in regard to the king of Sicily; for when\nthe king of Sicily was sailing with five gallies from Marseilles,\nnear to the port of Genoa, the Genoese, being in the interest of king\nLadislaus, hastily armed fifteen gallies with cross-bows and men at\narms, and sent them to attack the remainder of king Louis\u2019s fleet that\nwas following him, which they conquered, all but one, that escaped\nback to Marseilles by superior sailing, and carried the crews and all\ntheir baggage prisoners to Genoa.\n\nThe pope, having heard their request, asked some time to consider of\nit before he gave an answer. He could not well consent to it, because\nthe Genoese had been long connected with him, and he had also entered\ninto some engagements with king Ladislaus. The matter was, therefore,\ndeferred. King Louis was, notwithstanding this, magnificently feasted\nby the pope and cardinals; after which, he left his court well pleased,\nand returned to Provence.\n\nOn the first day of June, the pope held an open court, and signed many\ngraces and benefices, and all such things as with honour and justice he\ncould sign. He continued from that time to hold public audiences, and\nto do whatever business appertained to the papacy.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XIX.\n\n    THE GRAND MASTER OF PRUSSIA MARCHES A POWERFUL ARMY OF\n    CHRISTIANS INTO LITHUANIA.\n\n\nThis year, 1410, the grand master of the Teutonic order, accompanied\nby his brother knights and a numerous army of three hundred thousand\nChristians, invaded the kingdom of Lithuania, to destroy the whole of\nit. The king of Lithuania was soon ready to meet him; and, aided by\nthe king of Sarmatia, he assembled an army of four hundred thousand\ninfidels, and offered battle.\n\nThe Christians gained a complete victory,--for there remained dead on\nthe field full thirty-six thousand infidels, the principals of whom\nwere the grand general of Lithuania and the constable of Sarmatia. The\nremnant, with the other officers, escaped by flight. Of the Christians,\nonly two hundred were slain, but a great many were wounded.\n\nShortly after, the king of Poland, who was a determined enemy to\nthe grand master of Prussia, (and who had but faintly accepted of\nChristianity in order to obtain his kingdom) marched his Polanders to\nthe assistance of the infidels, whom he strongly pressed to renew the\nwar against Prussia, insomuch that, eight days after this defeat, the\nking of Poland, in conjunction with the aforesaid two kings, assembled\nan army of six hundred thousand men, and marched against the grand\nmaster of Prussia, and other Christian lords. A battle ensued, which\nwas lost by the Christians, who had more than sixty thousand killed\nand wounded. In the number of dead were the grand master of Prussia,\nwith a noble knight from Normandy, called sir John de Ferriere, son to\nthe lord de Ferriere, and another from Picardy, son to the lord du Bos\nd\u2019Ancquin.\n\nIt was currently reported that the day had been lost through the fault\nof the constable of Hungary, who commanded the second squadron of the\nChristians, by running away with all his Hungarians. The infidels,\nhowever, did not gain the glory without loss,--for without counting\nthe Polanders, who had ten thousand men slain, they lost upward of\nsix-score thousand men, according to the reports of the heralds, and\nthe bastard of Scotland, called the count de Hembe[60].\n\nThe lord de Kyeuraing and John de Grez, Hainaulters, were there, and\nwith them full twenty-four gentlemen, their countrymen, who were unhurt\nat this battle, and returned home as speedily as they could.\n\nAfter the engagement, the infidels entered Prussia, and despoiled\nmany parts of it, and took twelve inclosed towns in a short time and\ndestroyed them. They would have persevered in their wickedness, and\nhave done further mischief, had not a valiant knight of the Teutonic\norder, named Charles de Mouroufle[61], rallied a great number of the\nChristians who had fled, and by his prudence and vigour regained the\ngreater part of these towns, and finally driven the infidels out of the\ncountry[62].\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XX.\n\n    THE DUKE OF BERRY QUITS PARIS, AND RETIRES TO HIS OWN\n    ESTATES.--HE GOES AFTERWARD TO ANGERS, AND UNITES WITH THE DUKE\n    OF ORLEANS AND THE OTHER PRINCES OF HIS PARTY.\n\n\nThe duke of Berry, finding that he had not that government of the\nking and the duke of Acquitaine to which he had been accustomed,\nbecame very discontented, and retired to his estates, indignant at\nthe ministers, and particularly at his nephew and godson, the duke\nof Burgundy. Shortly after, he went to Angers, where the dukes of\nOrleans and of Bourbon, and all the principal lords of that party, were\nassembled.\n\nThey went in a body to the cathedral church, and there made oath, in\nthe most solemn manner, to support each other, and mutually to defend\ntheir honour against all who should attempt any thing against it,\nexcepting the king, and ever to remain in strict friendship united,\nwithout acting to the contrary in any kind of measure.\n\nMany great lords in France were not pleased with this confederation;\nand when, shortly after, news of it was brought to the king and his\ncouncil, he was much astonished and dissatisfied therewith.\n\nThe king, in consequence of the advice of the duke of Burgundy and his\nfriends, marched out of Paris, accompanied by him, the duke of Brabant,\nthe count de Montagu, and a large body of chivalry, and went to Senlis:\nthence to the town of Creil, to regain the castle of that place, which\nthe duke of Bourbon held, and had given the government of it to some of\nhis people.\n\nThe governor made so many delays before he surrendered it that the\nking became much displeased; and because they had not obeyed his\nfirst summons, the garrison were made prisoners, and carried bound\nto the prisons of the Ch\u00e2telet in Paris. The countess of Clermont,\ncousin-german to the king, soon after made application for their\ndeliverance, and obtained it; and on the morrow the king appointed\nanother garrison, and returned to Paris.\n\nThis expedition was not very agreeable to the Orleans-faction,--and\nthey continued to collect daily, and inlist in their party as many as\nthey could.\n\nThe duke of Burgundy became very uneasy at their proceedings; for he\nsuspected the duke of Orleans and his party would infringe the peace\nwhich had so lately been patched up between them at Chartres, or that\nthey would march a large force to Paris, to seize the government,\ntogether with the persons of the king and duke of Acquitaine.\n\nTo obviate this, he caused several royal summons to be proclaimed in\nvarious parts of the realm, for the assembling of men at arms and\nquartering them in the villages round Paris, to be ready to defend the\nking and his government against the ill-intentioned. By the advice of\nhis brothers and the king of Navarre, he resolved to defend himself\nby force against his adversaries, and caused it to be proclaimed\nthroughout the kingdom, in the king\u2019s name, that no one should dare to\nassemble armed in company of the dukes of Berry and Orleans, and their\nallies, under pain of corporal punishment and confiscation of goods.\n\nThe Orleans-faction, however, continued their meetings in spite of\nthis proclamation, and even forced their vassals to serve under and\naccompany them: I mean, such of them as were dilatory in obeying their\nsummons. There were, therefore, at this time, great and frequent\nassemblies of armed men in different parts of France, to the prejudice\nof the poor people.\n\nThose lords that were well inclined to the king came to Paris, and\ntheir men were quartered in the flat country of the island of France.\nThe Orleans-party fixed their quarters at Chartres and the adjacent\nparts; and their forces might amount, according to the estimate of\nwell-informed persons, to full six thousand men in armour, four\nthousand cross-bows, and sixteen hundred archers, without counting the\nunarmed infantry, of which there were great numbers.\n\nIn regard to the army which the duke of Burgundy had assembled by\norders from the king, it was estimated to consist of upward of sixteen\nthousand combatants, all men of tried courage. During this time, the\nking of Navarre and his brother, the count de Mortain, at the request\nof the duke of Burgundy, negotiated a peace between the duke of\nBrittany, their nephew, and the count de Penthievre, son-in-law to the\nduke of Burgundy.\n\nThis was done in the hope that the duke of Brittany would be induced\nto assist the king with his Bretons, and give up the Orleans-party, to\nwhom he had engaged himself. On the conclusion of this peace between\nthe two parties, twenty thousand golden crowns were sent the duke, to\ndefray the expenses he had been at in raising men at arms.\n\nLarge sums of money were also sent to the lord d\u2019Albreth, constable\nof France, that he might collect a numerous body of men at arms, and\nmarch them to Paris, to serve the king. He had not any great desire to\nperform this, for he was wholly inclined to the duke of Orleans and his\nallies, as was perfectly notorious shortly afterward.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XXI.\n\n    THE DEATH OF THE DUKE OF BOURBON.--THE PROCLAMATION OF THE KING\n    OF FRANCE.--THE DUKE OF ORLEANS AND HIS ALLIES SEND LETTERS TO\n    THE PRINCIPAL TOWNS IN FRANCE.\n\n\nDuring this troublesome time, Louis duke of Bourbon, uncle to the\nking of France by the mother\u2019s side, being full sixty years of age,\nfeeling himself oppressed with years and sickness, caused himself to be\nconveyed to his residence at Moulins[63] in the Bourbonnois, where he\ndeparted this life, and was buried in the church of the canons, which\nhe had founded.\n\nHe was succeeded by his only son, the count de Clermont, who, after\nsome days of lamentation, had the funeral obsequies of his father\nperformed, and, having arranged his affairs, returned to the duke of\nOrleans and the other lords at Chartres, and firmly united himself with\nthem, treading in the steps of his late father. The duke of Bourbon\nhad long held the office of great chamberlain of France, from the\nfriendship of the king, and was in possession of it even at the time of\nhis death; but at the entreaty of the king of Navarre and the duke of\nBurgundy, the king now gave it to the count de Nevers, to exercise the\nduties of it in the usual manner.\n\nAt this time, the duchess of Brittany, daughter to the king of France,\nwas brought to bed of a son; and she sent to request the duke of\nAcquitaine, her brother, to stand godfather. He sent, as his proxy,\nsir David de Brimeu, knight, lord of Humbercourt, with a handsome\npresent of jewels, which sir David gave her on the part of the duke of\nAcquitaine.\n\nThe king again issued his summons to the different bailiwicks and\nseneschalships in the realm, for all persons to arm without delay who\nwere bounden so to do from the tenure of their fiefs or arriere fiefs,\nand to march instantly to Paris to serve the king against the dukes of\nOrleans, Berry, Bourbon, the counts d\u2019Armagnac, d\u2019Alen\u00e7on, and others\ntheir allies, who, notwithstanding the king\u2019s positive orders to the\ncontrary, continued daily to assemble large bodies of men at arms, to\nthe destruction of his country and subjects.\n\nThe above dukes wrote letters to the king, to the university of Paris,\nand to many of the principal towns, to explain the causes why they had\nthus confederated and collected men at arms; one of which, signed with\ntheir signs-manuel, they sent to the town of Amiens, and the contents\nwere as follows:\n\n\u2018To our well-beloved and very dear citizens, burgesses, and inhabitants\nof the town of Amiens, health and affection. We have written to\nour most redoubted and sovereign lord the king of France in manner\nfollowing:--We dukes of Berry, of Orleans, and of Bourbon, counts of\nAlen\u00e7on and of Armagnac, your humble uncles, relations and subjects,\nfor ourselves and all others our adherents, wellwishers to your\nperson,--as the rights of your domination, your crown and royal\nmajesty, have been so nobly instituted, and founded on justice,\npower, and the true obedience of your subjects,--and as your glory\nand authority are resplendent through all parts of the world, you\nhaving been worthily consecrated and anointed by the holy roman see,\nand considered by all Christendom as sovereign monarch and equal\ndistributor of justice, as well to the poor as to the rich, without\nowing obedience to any other lord, but God and his Divine Majesty, who\nhas been pleased most worthily to have gifted you,--may all those who\nare connected with you by blood, by their frank and loyal affections,\nguard and defend your sacred person as your relations and subjects.\n\n\u2018And may we, in particular, as your near relations, and for that cause\nmore obliged to it, set an example of due obedience to your other\nsubjects, and exert ourselves in preserving to you free liberty of\naction in every part of your government, insomuch that you may have\npower to reward the good and punish the wicked, and to preserve every\none in his just rights, and likewise that you may execute justice in\nsuch wise that your kingdom may remain in peace, first to the honour\nof God, and then to your own honour, and to the example of your good\nfriends and subjects, by following the paths of your predecessors,\nthe kings of France, who, by this noble way of governing their great\nkingdom, have ever preserved tranquillity and peace, insomuch that all\nChristian nations, far and near, and even infidels, have had recourse\nto them in their disputes, and have been perfectly contented with their\ndecisions on the cases referred to them, as the fountains of justice\nand loyalty.\n\n\u2018And, most sovereign lord, that your power, justice, and the state of\nyour government may not suffer at present any wound or diminution,\nand that public affairs may be managed according to the principles\nof reason, in such wise as may be apparent to all men of sound\nunderstanding;--\n\n\u2018For this effect, most redoubted sovereign, we, the above-written, have\nconfederated and assembled, that we may most humbly lay before you the\nreal state of your situation, in regard to your royal person, and also\nthat of my lord of Acquitaine, your eldest son. We have likewise to lay\nbefore you the manner in which you are enthralled, and the government\ncarried on, that justice may be restored, and the public weal no longer\nsuffer, as we can more fully explain. Should any persons deny this,\nlet your majesty, by the advice of your council, appoint some of the\nprinces of your blood, and other impartial and unprejudiced persons,\nto inquire into it, in whatever number you in your wisdom may select.\nBut we advise that you speedily and effectually provide for the safety\nof your own person, and for that of my lord of Acquitaine, your eldest\nson, so that your state may enjoy justice and a good government, to the\nadvancement of the public welfare, and that the power and authority\nmay be exercised by you alone, freely and uncontrolled by any other\nperson whatever; and that such a desirable object may be obtained, we,\nthe above-named, offer our earnest prayers, and, at the same time, our\nlives and fortunes, whatever they may be, which God has graciously\ngranted us in this world, for the just defence of your rights, and in\nopposing all who may attempt to infringe on them, if any such there be.\n\n\u2018Most redoubted lord, we also inform you, that we shall not break up\nour confederation until you shall have listened to us, and until we\nshall see that you have properly provided against the inconveniences\nwe have mentioned, and until you be fully and wholly reinstated in\nthat power which is your right. To this, most redoubted lord, are we\nbound, as well in regard to what we have already said, as from fear,\nhonour and reverence to our Creator, from whom originates your royal\nauthority, and also to satisfy justice, and then yourself, who are\nsovereign king on earth, and our sole lord. To your support we are\nurged by our kindred and by our love to your person; for in truth,\nmost redoubted sovereign, there is nothing we dread so much as having\noffended God, yourself, and wounded our own honour, by leaving for so\nlong time unnoticed the aforesaid grievances, which are notorious to\nevery one.\n\n\u2018In like manner as we signify the above to you, we shall do the same to\nall prelates, lords, universities, cities and principal towns of your\nrealm, and in general to all your wellwishers.\n\n\u2018Most redoubted lord, we humbly supplicate that you will deign to hear\nus, and consider of what we have written,--for the sole object we aim\nat personally affects yourself and your government; and we earnestly\nbeg that you will speedily adopt the most effectual measures for the\nenjoyment of your own freedom of action, and that your government may\nbe carried on to the praise of God first, and your own glory, and\nto the advantage of all your good subjects who are anxious for your\nwelfare.\n\n\u2018We have written this, that you may know our intentions, and the cause\nof our assembling, which is solely for the preservation of the personal\nliberty of our lord and king, and the affranchisement of his government\nfrom any hands but his own. For this object we have sought the advice\nof the most prudent men, and shall follow their counsels, with all the\nmeans God has put in our power, to obtain so desirable an end, for the\ngeneral welfare of the realm; and we intend so to act toward our lord\nthe king that God and the world shall be satisfied with us.\n\n\u2018And we most earnestly entreat that for so praiseworthy an object\nyou will join us, and exert yourselves in the same cause; for it is\nnot properly us but the king your lord that you will serve, whom by\nyour oaths you are bounden to assist,--and know that for so doing you\nwill be commended by all men of understanding and prudence. Given at\nChartres the 2d day of December, 1410.\u2019\n\nThis letter, when received by the council of the town of Amiens,\nproduced very little sensation,--for all, or the greater part of the\ninhabitants, were inclined to the duke of Burgundy. When a similar one\nwas read in the council of state, it did not make any impression on the\nking, nor did it seem advisable that the dukes should have an audience;\nbut, on the contrary, orders were sent to them to disband their forces\nwithout delay, on pain of incurring the royal indignation.----They\nrefused to obey this order, and bade the messenger tell the king,\nthat they would not cease assembling until he should grant them an\naudience, and hear their complaints. At this period, the dukes of\nAcquitaine and Burgundy paid a visit to the queen of France at her\nresidence in the castle of Melun, and left there a garrison, having\nbrought back with them the queen and her children to the castle of\nVincennes.\n\nThe duke of Brabant at this time left Paris, to go to his country, and\nassemble his Brabanters to serve the king. Many able ambassadors were\nsent, in the king\u2019s name, to the lords assembled at Chartres; and among\nthem was the grand master of Rhodes, to signify to them that they must\ndisband their army, and that, if they pleased to wait on the king in\ntheir private capacity, he would see them.\n\nThis they refused; and as they continued disobedient, the king took\npossession of the counties of Boulogne[64], Estampes, Valois,\nBeaumont, Clermont, and other lands belonging to the said dukes,\ncounts, and their adherents, of whatever rank they might be. The king\u2019s\nofficers appointed governors to the castles and fortresses within these\ncountries, whom they ordered to govern them at the expense of the\naforesaid lords.\n\nSo very numerous were the forces that assembled near Paris, in\nobedience to the summons from the king and the duke of Burgundy, that\nthe oldest persons had not for a long time seen so many men at arms\ntogether.\n\nAmong the number was the duke of Brabant, with a great force. He was\nquartered in the town of St Denis, where he lived at the expense of the\ngreater part of the inhabitants, as if he had been in the open country.\nThe count de Penthievre, son-in-law to the duke of Burgundy, was there\nwith him, accompanied by a large body of Bretons.\n\nTwo thousand men belonging to the count Waleran de St Pol were\nquartered at Menil-Aubry, and the adjacent villages.--Because the\ncount himself resided in Paris, he one day ordered his troops to be\nassembled under the lord de Chin, for him to march them to Paris to be\nmustered and enrolled for pay; but it happened, as they were marching\nthrough St Denis to obey the order, that a dispute arose between them\nand the Brabanters, on account of some enterprise which the last had\nmade against the lord de Carlian, a native of the Boulonois, so that\nthe two parties armed and drew up in battle-array to decide matters\nby combat. The duke of Brabant was soon informed of this tumult, and\nhastened from Paris to check his own men, and acted so prudently with\nboth parties that an end was put to it; but he was very wroth with the\nfirst promoters of it, for he was married to the daughter and heiress\nof the count de St Pol.\n\nWhen they had marched through Saint Denis, they came before their lord,\nthe count de St Pol, in Paris, who having reviewed them, and paid many\ncompliments to their captains, dismissed them to the quarters whence\nthey had come. In order to pay these troops which had been levied,\nas has been said, by orders from the king and the duke of Burgundy,\nand which amounted, by the muster-rolls, to fifteen thousand men with\nhelmets, seventeen thousand cross-bows and archers, very heavy taxes\nwere levied throughout the realm, and particularly on the city of\nParis. It will be impossible to relate one half of the mischiefs the\narmies of both parties committed: suffice it to say, that churches,\nchurchmen, and the poor people were very great sufferers.\n\nThe Orleans-party, shortly after this, marched from Chartres\nto Montlehery, seven leagues from Paris, and there, and in the\nneighbouring villages, quartered their army, ruining the whole country\non their line of march. The lords and adherents of this faction, as\nwell clergy as seculars, wore, as their badge, a narrow band of white\nlinen on their shoulders, hanging over their left arm, like to a deacon\nwhen celebrating divine service.\n\nWhen the king of France and his council learnt that they had approached\nso near the capital, they hastily dispatched to the leaders the count\nde la Marche, the archbishop of Rheims, the bishop of Beauvais, and the\ngrand master of Rhodes, with some others, to persuade them to disband\ntheir army, and come before him at Paris, in consequence of his former\norders, without arms, in the manner in which vassals should wait on\ntheir lords, and that he would do them justice in regard to their\ndemands; but that, should they refuse, he would instantly march his\nforces against them.--The princes made answer, that they would not\nact otherwise than they had said in their letter to the king; and the\nambassadors, seeing they could not gain any thing, returned to Paris.\n\nIn like manner, the university sent to them an embassy of learned\nmen, headed by Noe\u00e9tz, abbot of Povegny and doctor in divinity, who\nharangued them very ably and gravely. They were very handsomely\nreceived by the princes, especially by the duke of Berry, who, among\nother grievances, complained much that his nephew, the king, should be\ncounselled by such fellows as the provost of Paris, and others of the\nsame sort, who now ruled the realm, which was most miserably governed,\nas he was ready to explain, article by article, when they should be\nadmitted to an audience.\n\nThey could obtain no other reply than that, with God\u2019s pleasure, they\nwould accomplish, to the utmost of their power, the matters contained\nin their circular letters to the university and principal towns.\n\nOn this repeated ill success, the king, by the advice of his council,\nsent another embassy, composed of the queen, the cardinal de Bar, the\ncount de St Pol, and others. The count de St Pol had lately accepted,\nwith the king\u2019s approbation, the office of grand butler of France,\nwhich the provost of Paris had held, through the interest of the count\nde Tancarville, by a gift from the king.\n\nNotwithstanding the queen and her companions were received with every\nhonour, she did not remain with their army, but went to the castle\nof Marcoussi, which is not far distant from Montlehery, with her\nattendants, and remained there some time negotiating with them, and\nsome of the princes daily visited her. Although she acted with much\nperseverance, she failed in her object,--for the princes were firm in\ntheir resolution of marching with their army to the king, and requiring\nthat he would execute justice and attend to the affairs of government,\nand choose another set of ministers than those now in power.\n\nFinding she was labouring in vain, she returned with her companions\nto Paris, and related to the king all that had passed. He was very\nindignant, and much troubled thereat; and on the morrow, the 23d\nSeptember, he ordered all the men at arms that were come to serve him\nto be drawn out, and the baggage and artillery waggons to be made ready\ninstantly to march against the Orleans-party, to give them battle.\n\nWhen all were ready, and as he was going to attend mass and afterward\nto mount his horse, he was met by the rector of the university,\nmagnificently accompanied by all the members and supporters of it, who\nremonstrated with him, that his daughter, the university of Paris, was\npreparing to leave that city, from the great want of provisions, which\nthe men at arms of the two parties prevented coming to Paris,--for no\none could venture on the high roads without being robbed and insulted;\nand, likewise, that all the low countries round Paris were despoiled by\nthese men at arms. They most humbly requested, that he would provide\na remedy, and give them such answer as might seem to him good. The\nchancellor, namely, master Arnauld de Corbie, instantly replied, \u2018The\nking will assemble his council after dinner, and you shall have an\nanswer.\u2019 The king of Navarre, being present, entreated the king that he\nwould fix an hour for hearing them again after dinner; and the king,\ncomplying with his request, appointed an hour for the rector to return.\n\nWhen the king had dined, he entered the _chambre verde_, attended by\nthe following princes: the dukes of Acquitaine, Burgundy and Brabant,\nthe marquis du Pont, the duke of Lorraine, the counts de Mortain,\nde Nevers and de Vaudemont, with many other great lords, as well\necclesiastical as secular. The king of Navarre made four requests to\nthe king: first, that all the princes of the blood, as well on the one\nside as on the other, should retire to their principalities, and never\nmore interfere in the king\u2019s government, and likewise that henceforth\nthey should not receive any profits or pensions, as well from the\nsubsidies arising from their lands as from other exactions, but live\non their own proper revenues until the public treasury should be in\na better state than it was at that moment: however, should the king\nbe inclined to make them presents of any thing, or call them near his\nperson, they should be alway ready to obey him.\n\nHis second request was, that some diminution should take place in those\ntaxes that most aggrieved the people.\n\nThe third, that as some of the citizens of Paris had lent different\nsums of money to the king, of which repayment had been promised, but\nnot made, sufficient assignments on the treasury should be given to\nthem.\n\nThe fourth, that the affairs of the king and realm should be governed\nby prudent men, taken from the three estates of the kingdom. When the\nking of Navarre had ended, the king himself replied, and said he would\ntake advice on what he had proposed, and then give him such answers as\nought to satisfy him and every one else.\n\nWhen this was over, the king showed the same determination as before\nto march, on the morrow morning, against the rebellious lords; but he\nwas overruled, and the queen, with the former ambassadors, were again\nsent to negotiate a peace. On their arrival at the army of the princes,\nshe exerted herself, as it was said very much and loyally; for it was\ncommonly reported that she was in her heart inclined to the Orleans\nfaction.\n\nDuring the time of this embassy, the count Am\u00e9 de Savoye, who had been\nsent for by the king, arrived at Paris with five hundred men at arms.\nHis brothers-in-law the dukes of Burgundy and Brabant, and the count\nde Nevers, attended by many other lords, went out to meet him beyond\nthe gate of St Anthony, and thence conducted him to the palace to the\nking, who very kindly received him.\n\nSome days after, the queen, not having more success than before,\nreturned to the king, and told him that she could not any way bring\nthem to terms, for they were obstinate in their original intentions.\nShe then hastened to the castle of Vincennes as speedily as she could.\n\nOn the ensuing morning, the aforesaid lords quitted Montlehery; and\nthe duke of Berry came to his h\u00f4tel of Vinchestre[65], which he had\nrebuilt, and was there lodged. The duke of Orleans fixed his quarters\nat Gentilly, in the palace of the bishop, and the count d\u2019Armagnac at\nVitry; the rest as near to each other as they could; and at vespers,\nthey had advanced as far as the suburbs of St Marcel and the gate de\nBordelles.\n\nThe king, the duke of Burgundy, and the other princes, were greatly\nsurprised at this boldness; and the Parisians, at their own expense,\ncollected a body of a thousand men armed with helmets to serve as a\nguard during the night, and they also made great fires in very many of\nthe streets. To prevent them from crossing the Seine at Charenton, they\nsent two hundred men at arms to defend that pass.\n\nThe third day, Arthur count de Richemont, brother to the duke of\nBrittany, joined the dukes of Berry and Orleans, with six thousand\nbreton horse, to the great displeasure of the king, and especially of\nthe duke of Burgundy; for the duke of Brittany had lately been summoned\nby the king to attend him with his Bretons, and had, for this purpose,\nreceived a very large sum of money. The duke, in consequence, having\nother business in hand, sent his brother to serve the king in his room.\n\nIt was also said, that the lord d\u2019Albreth, constable of France, had\ndisposed of the money sent him in the same manner, and had employed it\nin the service of the duke of Berry. The army of the princes marched to\nSaint Cloud, and to the adjoining towns, which they plundered, taking\nby force whatever they were in need of. Some of the worst of them\nravished and robbed many women, who fled to Paris, and made clamorous\noutcries against their ravishers, requiring vengeance from the king,\nand restitution, were it possible, of what they had been plundered of.\n\nThe king, moved with pity, and by the importunity of his ministers,\nordered a decree to be drawn out, which condemned the whole of the\nOrleans-party to death and confiscation of goods. While this was doing,\nthe duke of Berry, uncle to the king, hastily sent ambassadors to\nParis to prevent it from taking effect, and in the name of their lord\nrequested that the decree might be a little delayed, when other means\nof accommodation, through God\u2019s grace, would be found.\n\nThis request was granted, and the proclamation of the decree put off:\na negotiation was entered into warmly by both parties, although the\nking was very much displeased that the princes of his blood were thus\nquarrelling with each other, so that he should be forced to proceed\nwith rigour against them. To prevent the effusion of blood, the king\ndesired his chancellor and others of his privy council to exert\nthemselves diligently that peace might be established; and he likewise\nspoke to the same purpose to the duke of Burgundy, the count de St\nPol, and other princes, who promised faithfully that an accommodation\nshould take place.\n\nWhile these matters were going on, the lord de Dampierre, the bishop\nof Noyon, the lord de Tignonville, master Gautier de Col, and others,\nambassadors from the king of France, were sent from Paris to Boulogne,\nto meet an embassy from the king of England, consisting of the lord\nBeaumont, the bishop of St David\u2019s, and others, who had arrived at\nCalais to treat of a truce. It was prolonged from All-saints-day, when\nthe former one expired, to the feast of Easter ensuing.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XXII.\n\n    IN CONSEQUENCE OF THE NEGOTIATIONS BETWEEN THE TWO PARTIES OF\n    BURGUNDY AND OF ORLEANS, PEACE IS MADE BETWEEN THEM, AND CALLED\n    \u2018THE PEACE OF WINCHESTER,\u2019 WHICH WAS THE SECOND PEACE.\n\n\nAfter the ambassadors from both parties, namely those of the king and\nduke of Burgundy on the one hand, and those of the dukes of Berry, of\nOrleans, and of Bourbon, on the other, had held several conferences,\nthe following treaty was at length concluded, on the 2d of November.\n\nThe princes of the blood on each side, with the exception of the count\nde Mortain, were to retire to their principalities, and lead back their\nforces, committing as little damage as possible to the countries they\nshould pass through, without fraud or deception. The duke of Berry had\nliberty, if he pleased, to reside at Giens-sur-Loire, and the count\nd\u2019Armagnac might stay there with him for fifteen days. The king of\nNavarre was to depart for his duchy of Nemours. The duke of Brabant\nmight, if he so pleased, visit his sister, the duchess of Burgundy, in\nthat country.\n\nThe aforesaid princes were to conduct their men at arms so that all\ntrespassing might be mutually avoided on each other\u2019s lands,--nor\nshould they suffer any of their adherents to commit waste or damage, so\nthat all inconvenience or source of quarrel might be avoided.\n\nItem, in whatever garrisons there shall be more men than are usually\nkept, the same shall be reduced to the accustomed number of men\nretained therein for its defence, without any fraud or deception. And\nthat these terms may be faithfully observed, the aforesaid lords shall\npromise, on their oaths, made before such princes as the king may\nnominate, that they will punctually and loyally keep every article.\n\nItem, the captains of their troops shall make oath also to the due\nobservance of this treaty; and if it be the good pleasure of the king\nhe may appoint some of his knights as conductors to the men at arms,\nand superintendents on their leaders, to prevent them and their men\nfrom delaying their march, and also from committing waste in the\ncountries through which they shall pass.\n\nItem, the aforesaid lords will not return near the person of the king,\nunless they be sent for by him, by letters patent under the great seal,\nconfirmed by his council, or on urgent business,--nor shall any of the\naforesaid lords intrigue to obtain orders for their return; and this\nthey shall especially swear to before commissioners nominated for the\npurpose. The king shall make the terms of this treaty public, and all\nthe articles they shall swear to observe.\n\nShould the king think it necessary to send for the duke of Berry,\nhe shall, at the same time, summon the duke of Burgundy, and _vice\nversa_; and this he will observe, in order that they may both meet at\nthe same time on the appointed day, which will hold good until the\nensuing Easter in the year 1411; and from that day until the following\nEaster in 1412, no one of the aforesaid shall proceed against another\nby acts of violence or by words.--Every article of this treaty to be\nproperly drawn out and signed by the king and his council, with certain\npenalties to be incurred on the infringement of any of them.\n\nItem, the king shall select certain able and discreet persons, of\nunblemished characters, and no way pensioners, but such as have solely\ngiven their oaths of allegiance to the king, to form the royal council;\nand when such persons have been chosen, a list of their names shall be\nshown to the princes on each side.\n\nItem, the dukes of Berry and Burgundy, having the wardship of the duke\nof Acquitaine, shall agree together as to the person who shall be their\nsubstitute in that office during their absence; and powers for so doing\nshall be sent to the duke of Berry, as he is at present without them.\n\nItem, the provost of Paris shall be dismissed from all offices which he\nholds under the king, and another shall be appointed according to the\nking\u2019s pleasure, and as he may judge expedient.\n\nItem, it was ordained, that no knight, or his heirs, should in future\nsuffer any molestation because he had not obeyed the summons sent him\nby either of the parties; and should they be any way molested, the king\nwould punish the offender by confiscation of his property. Letters,\nconfirming this last article, shall be given by the king and the\naforesaid lords to whoever may require them.\n\nThis treaty was concluded on All-saints day, and on the ensuing Monday\nconfirmed; and four days after, the greater part of the articles were\nfulfilled. Sir John de Neele, chancellor to the duke of Acquitaine,\nwas, by the king\u2019s command, appointed to receive the oaths of the lords\non each side.\n\nThe king dismissed his provost of Paris, sir Peter des Essars, knight,\nfrom all his offices, and nominated sir Brunelet de Sainct-Cler, one of\nhis masters of the household, to the provostship. He also sent letters,\nsealed with his great seal, to the duke of Berry, appointing him to\nthe guardianship of his son, the duke of Acquitaine.\n\nIn consequence of one of the articles above recited, twelve knights,\nfour bishops, and four lords of the parliament, were appointed to\ngovern the kingdom,--namely, the archbishop of Rheims, the bishops\nof Noyon and Saint Flour, master John de Torcy, lately one of the\nparliament, but now bishop of Tournay, the grand master of the king\u2019s\nhousehold sir Guichart Daulphin, the grand master of Rhodes, the\nlords de Montenay, de Toursy, de Rambures, d\u2019Offemont, de Rouvroy, de\nRumacourt, Saquet de Toursy, le vidame d\u2019Amiens, sir John de Toursy,\nknight to the duke of Berry, and grand master of his household, and the\nlord de St George. The two last were nominated, by the dukes of Berry\nand Burgundy, guardians to the duke of Acquitaine during their absence.\n\nThe two parties now left Paris and the adjoining fortresses and\ncastles; but on the following Saturday, the king was again strongly\nseized with his usual malady, and confined in his h\u00f4tel of St Pol. The\nqueen and her attendants, then at Vincennes, returned to Paris with her\nson, the duke of Acquitaine, and fixed their residence, with her lord,\nin the h\u00f4tel de St Pol.\n\nThe duke of Burgundy went to Meaux, where he was met by the king of\nNavarre;--and thence the duke went to Arras and Flanders, accompanied\nby sir Peter des Essars, late provost of Paris, and his most\nconfidential adviser; and he always gave him the title of provost of\nParis, as though he had still retained the office.\n\nConformably to the treaty, all the men at arms on each side returned\nto the places whence they had come, but plundering the poor people\non their march. A number of Lombards and Gascons had formed part of\nthe army of the duke of Orleans, who were mounted on terrible horses,\nthat were taught to wheel round when on full gallop, which seemed very\nastonishing to the French, Flemings, Picards, and Brabanters, who had\nnot been accustomed to such movements.\n\nBecause the count d\u2019Armagnac had joined the duke of Orleans with a\nlarge body, his men were called _Armagnacs_; and in consequence, the\nwhole of that faction were called _Armagnacs_. Although there were many\nprinces of much higher rank in either party than the count d\u2019Armagnac,\nthey were not pleased if they were not called by this name, which\nlasted a very considerable time.\n\nAs the treaty before mentioned had been concluded at the h\u00f4tel de\nWinchester, where the dukes of Berry and Orleans, with others of their\nparty were amusing themselves, it was called \u2018The Peace of Winchester.\u2019\n\nAll who had come to these meetings at Paris now departed, and those\nto whom the government had been intrusted remained near the person of\nthe king and the duke of Acquitaine. The people expected, that by this\nmeans they should enjoy more peaceable times; but it happened just the\ncontrary, as you shall shortly hear.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XXIII.\n\n    A MEETING OF THE UNIVERSITY AND CLERGY IS HELD ON THE XXIII. OF\n    NOVEMBER, IN THE CHURCH OF ST BERNARD AT PARIS, ON THE STATE OF\n    THE CHURCH.\n\n\nWhen peace had been established, a large congregation was held, by\norder of the university, on the 23d of November, in the church of\nthe Bernardins in Paris,--to which were called, the bishop of Puy\nin Auvergne, many other prelates, and in general all bachelors and\nlicentiates in canon and civil law, although in former times doctors\nonly had been summoned.\n\nThis assembly was holden at the request of the archbishop of Pisa,\nand other legates from the pope, on the subject of tythes, the vacant\nbenefices, and the effects of the dead. But it was opened by the\nadoption of a solemn ordinance, which had been ordained during the\npapacy of Pietro della Luna, respecting the liberties of the french\nchurch, in the year 1406, and since confirmed by the king, his great\ncouncil, and the parliament, namely, that the said church shall be\nmaintained in all its ancient privileges. It was thus freed from all\ntythes, procurations, and subsidies, or taxes whatever. And as the\nobject of these legates was to establish the above impositions, it was\nresolved that the aforesaid ordinance should be strictly conformed to;\nand the more effectually to have it observed, they sent deputations\nto the king, to his council, and to the parliament, to whom the guard\nof this ordinance belonged, to obviate the inconveniences that might\nfollow should any article of it be infringed.\n\nIt was also concluded, that should the legates attempt, by menaces of\necclesiastical censures or otherwise, to compel payment of any tribute,\nan appeal should be made from them to a general council of the church.\n\nItem, should any collectors or sub-collectors exact subsidies to\nthe church, they shall be arrested, and punished by confiscation of\nproperty, and, when they have no property, by imprisonment.\n\nIt was also concluded, that to settle this matter, the king\u2019s attorney,\nand other lords, should be requested to join the university. But it was\nat last resolved, that should the pope plead an evident want of means\nto support the church, a council should be called, and a charitable\nsubsidy granted, the which should be collected by certain discreet\npersons selected by the council, and the amount distributed according\nto the directions of the said council.\n\nOn the ensuing Monday was held a royal sessions, at which the duke of\nAcquitaine, the archbishop of Pisa, and the other legates from the\npope, the rector and the members of the university were present. In\nthis meeting, the archbishop declared, that what he demanded was due\nto the apostolic chamber, by every right, divine, canon, civil and\nnatural, and that it was sacred and simple justice,--adding, that\nwhoever should deny this right was scarcely a Christian.\n\nThe university was greatly displeased, and said, that such expressions\nwere derogatory to the king\u2019s honour, to that of the university, and\nconsequently of the whole kingdom. From what had passed, another\ngeneral assembly was holden on Sunday the 30th of November, in the\nplace where it had been held the preceding Sunday; and it was then\ndetermined that the university should send a deputation to the king,\nto lay before him the words uttered by the legates, and to demand that\nthey should be publicly recanted by them. It was proposed, that in case\nthey should refuse so to do, the faculty of theologians should bring\naccusations against them, on the articles of faith, and they should be\npunished according to the exigence of the case. It was also resolved,\nthat the university of Paris should write letters to all the other\nuniversities in the realm, and to the prelates and clergy, to invite\nthem to unite in their opposition to such tenets.\n\nMany other things were agitated in this meeting, which I pass over for\nthe sake of brevity. It was, however, finally concluded to send an\nanswer to the pope, that he could not have any subsidy granted him in\nthe way which had been proposed. The meeting came to the resolution,\nthat the university of Paris should require from the archbishop of\nRheims, and those of the members of the king\u2019s government who, as\nmembers, had given their oaths to the university, to join in the\nmeasures they had adopted, otherwise they should be expelled the\nuniversity.\n\nIt should be known, that while these things were passing, the legates,\nfearful of the consequences, hastily left Paris, without taking leave,\nas is usually done. The holy father, however, sent ambassadors to the\nking, to demand payment of the tenth imposed on the french church. When\nthey declared the object of their mission to the council of state, and\nin the presence of the duke of Acquitaine, they said, that not only\nwas the french church bound to pay this subsidy to the pope, but all\nother churches which were under his obedience,--first, from the divine\nlaw in Leviticus, which declares that all deacons shall pay to the\nhigh priest a tenth of their possessions,--and, 2dly, by natural and\npositive law.\n\nWhilst these things were passing, the university came to the council,\nand on the morrow a congregation was held in the monastery of the\nBernardins. It was then resolved that the manner of demanding this\nsubsidy should be reprobated, for that it was iniquitous, and contrary\nto the decree of the king and his council in the year 1406, for the\npreservation of the franchises of the french church. The university\ninsisted on this decree being preserved inviolate, and declared, that\nif the pope or his legates attempted to constrain any person to pay\nthis subsidy by censures of the church, it would appeal to a general\ncouncil on this subject. Should any of the new ministers attempt any\nthing against this decree, the university would appeal to the king and\nthe whole council of state; and should any members of the university\nurge the payment of this tenth, they should be expelled; and if any\npersons, guilty of the above offence, should have any property of their\nown, the university would require that the said property should be\nconfiscated to the king\u2019s use, otherwise they should be imprisoned.\n\nShould the holy father adopt the manner of raising this subsidy by\nway of charity, it would be agreeable to the university that the king\nshould call together the prelates of his realm,--first, to consider\nwhat subjects should be discussed in the general council of the church\nto be holden on this occasion; secondly, to deliberate on the demands\nmade by the ambassadors respecting the tenth. Should it be determined\nfor the pope to receive this subsidy, the university expressed its wish\nthat some sufficient person should be deputed from this kingdom to\nreceive the amount of the same, for the peace and union of the greek\nand latin churches, and from England for aid of the holy land, and the\npreaching the gospel to all the world; for such were the purposes for\nwhich the legates declared the holy father raised this subsidy. The\nuniversity solicited the members of the parliament to unite themselves\nwith them, for it was in support of their decree made on the demand of\nthe king\u2019s attorney-general.\n\nJuvenal des Ursins[66] was deputed by the university to reply to what\nthe pope\u2019s ambassadors had advanced before the council; but at length\nthe archbishop of Pisa, perceiving he could not otherwise gain his\nobject, humbled himself much before the university, and spoke privately\nto some of the principal members to prevail on them to assist him.\nHowever, on the 28th day of January, it was declared, that no subsidy\nwhatever should be granted to the pope without the previous consent of\nthe french church; and the deliberation on this matter was deferred to\nthe 10th of February, when many prelates were summoned to give their\nopinions thereon. Through the active diligence of the university, the\nlegates could not obtain consent that a subsidy in any shape should be\ngranted to the pope, although the greater part of the lords, and in\nparticular the princes, were very agreeable to it.\n\nWhile these matters were transacting at Paris, the holy father sent\nletters to the king of France and to the university, to say that\nthe Florentines refused any longer to obey him, from fear of king\nLadislaus; that this king Ladislaus was assembling an immense army,\nas the pope wrote word, to conquer Rome and the adjacent country,\nthat he might place in the chair of St Peter a pope according to his\npleasure. Should this happen, a more ruinous schism might befal the\nchurch than the former one,--to obviate which, he requested from the\nking, the princes, and university, aid and support. This was, through\nthe intercession of the archbishop of Pisa, complied with, and in the\nmanner that shall be hereafter related.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XXIV.\n\n    THE LORD DE CROY IS MADE PRISONER WHEN GOING ON AN EMBASSY\n    FROM THE DUKE OF BURGUNDY TO THE DUKE OF BERRY, TO THE GREAT\n    DISPLEASURE OF THE LATTER.\n\n\nThe duke of Burgundy, shortly after he had left Paris, sent three of\nhis counsellors, namely, the lords de Croy and de Dours, knights, and\nmaster Raoul, head canon of Tournay and of Amiens, licentiate of law,\nas ambassadors to the king at Paris, and to his uncle and godfather,\nthe duke of Berry, at Bourges. But when they were travelling between\nOrleans and Bourges, the lord de Croy was arrested by the officers\nof the duke of Orleans on the last day but one of January, without\nany molestation being given to the other two ambassadors or their\nattendants.\n\nHe was carried to a castle within three leagues of Blois, and, on the\nmorrow, strictly interrogated respecting the murder of the late duke\nof Orleans, and put to the torture to confess if he had been any way\nconsenting to it, or an accomplice in it; but they could not discover\nany thing to his prejudice. On the following Sunday, he was carried to\nBlois, and confined in the dungeons of a prison.\n\nThe other ambassadors continued their route to Bourges, where, having\nexplained to the duke of Berry the object of their mission, they humbly\nentreated that he would exert himself with the duke of Orleans that the\nlord de Croy might obtain his liberty. When they related to him the\nmanner of the lord de Croy being arrested, the duke was filled with\nindignation, and instantly sent letters signed with his hand to the\nduke of Orleans, to say that he must immediately give up his prisoner,\nwhom he had illegally arrested when coming to him; and that if he did\nnot do it, he would have him for his enemy.\n\nThe duke of Orleans, on the receipt of this letter, considered it well,\nand replied at length most courteously to the duke of Berry, excusing\nhimself for what he had done, but putting off the setting the lord de\nCroy at liberty. The king and the duke of Acquitaine were soon made\nacquainted with this arrest,--and they sent letters to the duke of\nOrleans, commanding him instantly to deliver the lord de Croy from his\nimprisonment, on pain of incurring their indignation.\n\nNotwithstanding these letters, the duke of Orleans would not give him\nhis liberty, but kept him in close confinement, where he was very often\nmost rigorously treated, and at times examined and put to the torture.\n\nIn the mean time, the other ambassadors sent messengers to the duke of\nBurgundy, to notify to him this conduct and the means they had taken in\nvain for the deliverance of the lord de Croy.\n\nThe duke was much surprised and vexed at this news, for he greatly\nloved the lord de Croy. Having considered this insult, and others that\nhad been offered to his friends, he thought it time to take effectual\nmeasures for his security, and in consequence amassed as large a sum as\nhe could: to this end, he sold his right to all confiscations within\nthe town of Ghent to the townsmen, and yielded for money several other\nprivileges to the Flemings. He likewise carried his son, the count\nde Charolois, to show him to many of the principal towns as their\nfuture lord, who, on this occasion, made him considerable presents. He\nafterward held a grand council on his affairs, in the town of Tournay,\nwhich was attended by his brothers-in-law duke William and the bishop\nof Liege. The count de Namur was also present, and several great lords\nfrom the borders of the empire. The duke of Burgundy solicited their\naid against his enemies, should need be, and in particular against\nthe duke of Orleans, his brothers and allies. This service they\noffered him liberally, to the utmost of their power. Having obtained\ntheir promises, he went to Lille, whither the marshal Boucicaut, late\ngovernor of Genoa, came to meet him. He received him very kindly, and\ncarried him with him to his town of Arras, whither he had convoked all\nthe lords and nobles of the county of Artois and its dependancies.\n\nWhen they were assembled in the great hall of his residence, he\naddressed them himself, and caused them to be harangued by master\nWilliam Bouvier, knight, licentiate of law, to explain how his enemies\nwere plotting daily to arrest and imprison his friends, and had\nactually arrested and imprisoned the lord de Croy; for which cause he\nhad now assembled them, to request that they would remain loyal, and\nthat, should there be a necessity, they would enter into his pay and\nserve him,--for they might be assured it would be solely in his own\ndefence, and for that of the king and the duke of Acquitaine, that\nhe would ever take up arms. He declared, that it was merely for the\npreservation of the crown to his present majesty, and to his heirs,\nthat he had slain the duke of Orleans, father to the present duke.\nThis death had been lately pardoned, and peace established by the\nking in the town of Chartres, and proclaimed by letters patent. He\nadded, that should any of the conditions of that treaty of Chartres be\nunaccomplished by him, he was ready to fulfil them, and willing to do\nany thing else that would afford satisfaction.\n\nWhen he had concluded his speech, the nobles and knights present\nunanimously replied, that they would serve him to the utmost of their\npower. The meeting then broke up, and each man returned to his own\ncountry and home.\n\nThe marshal Boucicaut went to Paris, and in full council, presided\nby the duke of Acquitaine in the place of his father, he accused the\nGenoese of various crimes, and exculpated himself for having lost that\ntown; and ended by entreating, that he might be sufficiently supplied\nwith men and money to offer them battle and regain it.\n\nThe council deferred giving an answer at the moment, but appointed a\nday for him to receive it. In the mean time, Boucicaut waited on all\nthe principal lords, to interest them in his cause, and to beg that\nthey would press the king and council to hasten a compliance with his\nrequest. It was ordered by the council, conjunctively with the three\nestates, that the Genoese should be summoned to appear before them at\nParis, at the feast of Easter, when many of the nobles would be there\nassembled on other weighty affairs, particularly to have their consent\nthat the duke of Acquitaine should be appointed regent of the kingdom,\nfor the Parisians were extremely pressing that this should be done.\n\nThe duke of Berry, however, was much displeased when he heard of it,\nand, to prevent it, wrote urgent letters to the duke of Acquitaine, to\nthe queen, and to the great council, giving substantial reasons why\nthis could not and ought not to be done, considering how very young the\nduke of Acquitaine was,--adding, that he and his brother Philip duke of\nBurgundy, of good memory, had sworn on the holy sacrament that they\nwould support and defend, to their last drop of blood, their nephew,\nthe king now on the throne, against all who should attempt any thing to\nhis dishonour or disadvantage.\n\nWhile these things were in agitation, the king recovered his\nhealth,--and of course, the duke of Acquitaine was not regent, to the\ngreat satisfaction of the duke of Berry, who was much rejoiced thereat.\n\nIn consequence of the quarrel that had now again broken out between the\ndukes of Orleans and Burgundy, the king issued a proclamation to all\nthe bailiwicks, provostships, seneschalships and governments in his\nrealm, to forbid all nobles, of whatever rank they might be, and every\nother person, to obey the summons or join in arms either of the above\ndukes, under pain of their property being confiscated.\n\nOn the Wednesday of the holy week, the duke of Bourbon and the count\nde Vertus, brother to the duke of Orleans, marched five hundred men at\narms to Clermont in Beauvoisis, and thence invaded Normandy. The count\nde Vertus did not remain long there, but, taking a part of the men at\narms, left the duke of Bourbon, and hastened to the countries of the\nSoissonnois and Valois, to the territory of Coucy, which belonged to\nhis brother, and there placed a good garrison.\n\nTrue it is, that when the duke of Burgundy heard this, he was much\ntroubled, and, as speedily as he could, ordered his men at arms to meet\nhim at Ch\u00e2teau-Cambresis the last day but one of April. But when these\ntransactions came to the knowledge of the king and council, he sent\nable ambassadors to each of these dukes, to forbid them, under pain of\nhaving all their lands confiscated, and being declared enemies to their\nking and country, to attempt any expeditions against each other, and\ncommanded them instantly to disband their forces. For this time they\nvery humbly obeyed his orders, and deferred proceeding further for a\nconsiderable space.\n\n\n\n\n[A. D. 1411.]\n\nCHAP. XXV.\n\n    THE DUKE OF ORLEANS SENDS AMBASSADORS TO THE KING OF FRANCE,\n    WITH LETTERS OF ACCUSATION AGAINST THE DUKE OF BURGUNDY AND\n    THOSE OF HIS PARTY.\n\n\nAt the commencement of this year, the duke of Orleans was displeased\nthat those ministers who had been nominated by the duke of Burgundy had\ngreater influence than any of the others, and that they daily deprived\nsuch as had been attached to the late duke of Orleans, and were now\nhis friends, of their offices. In consequence, he sent ambassadors\nto the king to complain of this conduct, and to require that the\nmurderers of his father should be punished conformably to the articles\nof the treaty, but who were now residents within the kingdom. To these\nambassadors promises were made, on the part of the king, that proper\nremedies should be applied to give them satisfaction.\n\nOn their departure, the king sent to his uncle, the duke of Berry, at\nBourges, to require that he would interfere between his two nephews of\nOrleans and Burgundy, and make peace between them, which he engaged\nto do; and in consequence, he sent his chancellor, the archbishop of\nBourges, to Paris, well instructed by the duke how he was to act.\n\nShortly after, this chancellor, the marshal Boucicaut, with others,\nwere dispatched to the duke of Burgundy, then at St Omer, who, having\nheard all they had to say, replied, that it was no fault of his, nor\nshould it ever be so, that any articles of the late treaties were\ninfringed; for that in this, and in every thing else, he was very\ndesirous of obeying the king. And this his answer they laid before the\nking and council.\n\nBut as the proceedings against the murderers of the late duke of\nOrleans did not seem to his son, and his advisers, to be carried on\nwith sufficient vigour, he wrote letters, signed with his own hand, to\ncomplain of this and other matters to the king, the contents of which\nwere as follows:\n\n\u2018Most redoubted lord, after offering my humble recommendation,--lately,\nvery redoubted lord, two of your counsellors came to me, namely, sir\nCollart de Charleville, knight, and sir Simon de Nanterre, president of\nyour parliament, whom you had been pleased to send me to signify and\nexplain your good will and pleasure touching certain points, which they\nhave clearly and distinctly declared, according to the terms of their\ncommission.\n\n\u2018First, they require and entreat of me, in your name, who may command\nme as your loyal subject and humble servant, that I should submit the\nquarrel that subsists between me and the duke of Burgundy, for the\ninhuman and cruel murder of my very redoubted lord and father, and your\nown brother, on whose soul may God have mercy! to my lady the queen,\nand to my lord and uncle the duke of Berry, who has been in like manner\nsolicited by your ambassadors to labour diligently to establish a firm\npeace, for the general good of the kingdom.\n\n\u2018They have informed me, that you have also made a similar proposal to\nthe duke of Burgundy,--and that, to effectuate so desirable an object\nas peace, I should send four of my friends to my said uncle of Berry,\nwho will there meet the same number from the duke of Burgundy.\n\n\u2018The second point mentioned by them is, that you entreat I would desist\nfrom assembling men at arms.\n\n\u2018Thirdly, that I would accept of letters from you similar to those\nwhich had been formerly sent me at my request, respecting the\nmurderers, and their accomplices, of my late father and your brother.\n\n\u2018Having very maturely weighed and considered the above points, I reply,\nthat I most humbly thank you, very redoubted lord, for your grace and\nkindness in thus sending to me; and I can assure you, that I have no\ngreater pleasure than in hearing often from you, and of your noble\nstate; that I was, and am always ready to serve and obey you in body\nand fortune, to the utmost extent of my own and my subjects\u2019 abilities.\n\n\u2018But as the matters which they have mentioned to me in your name are\nof very high consideration and importance, concerning yourself and\nyour noble state, and as I shall ever be most anxious to show my ready\nobedience to your will, I was unable at the moment to make them any\nreply, excepting that I would send you an answer as speedily as I\ncould. This I have hitherto deferred, for I know you have near your\nperson, and in your council, several of my bitter enemies, whom you\nought to regard as yours also, and to whom I am unwilling that my\nanswer, or my future intentions, should be made known: neither is it\nright they should be made acquainted with what concerns me, or have the\nopportunity of giving their opinions in council, or elsewhere, relative\nthereto.\n\n\u2018I therefore assure you, most redoubted lord, in the fullest manner,\nthat I am your humble son and nephew, ready at all times to obey you\nas my sovereign lord, and most heartily anxious to honour and exalt to\nthe utmost of my power your crown and dignity, as well as that of the\nqueen, the duke of Acquitaine, and all your other children and kingdom,\nand to advise you most loyally and faithfully, without ever concealing\nany thing from you that may tend to the glory of your crown, or to the\nwelfare of your realm.\n\n\u2018I have some time hesitated to denounce to you such of my enemies, and\nyours also, as are in your council and service, namely, the bishop of\nTournay, the vidame d\u2019Amiens, John de Neelles[67], the lord de Heilly,\nCharles de Savoisy, Anthony des Essars, John de Courcelles, Peter de\nFontenay and Maurice de Railly, who, by force or underhand means, are\ncapable of doing me great mischief, insomuch that they have dismissed\ncertain very able men from their offices, who were your trusty\nservants, and have done them very great and irreparable damages: they\nare guilty also of insinuating very many falsehoods, to keep myself and\nothers, your relations and faithful servants, at a distance from you,\nby which, and other means equally dishonourable and iniquitous, long\nfollowed by them and their adherents, have they troubled the peace of\nthe kingdom: nor is it very probable that so long as such persons shall\nremain in power, and in your service, any firm or lasting peace can be\nestablished; for they will always prevent you from doing justice to\nmyself or to others, which ought indifferently to be done to all,--to\nthe poor as well as to the rich.\n\n\u2018This conduct they pursue, because they know themselves guilty of many\ncrimes, and especially John de Neelles and the lord de Heilly, who were\naccomplices in the murder of my late honoured father, and your only\nbrother, under the protection of the duke of Burgundy, the principal\nin this crime. They are his sworn servants and pensioners, or allies\nto the said duke, whence they may be reputed actors and accomplices in\nthis base and cowardly assassination. These accomplices, most redoubted\nlord, appear daily in your presence, and you ought to consider their\ncrimes in the same light as if done personally against you, for indeed\nyour authority was set at nought.\n\n\u2018That I may now say all that I know, I am satisfied, that had not the\ncourse of your justice been checked by the aforesaid persons and their\naccomplices, ample justice would have been done for the death of my\nlord and father, and your brother, with the aid of your officers and\nloyal subjects, as I know for certain that they were well inclined to\nit.\n\n\u2018For this I am very thankful; and I most earnestly pray you, for your\nown honour, for that of the queen and of the duke of Acquitaine, as\nwell as for the honour of your kingdom, that you would do good and fair\njustice, by causing these guilty persons to be arrested and punished,\nsince they are equally your enemies as mine,--and that you would not\nlonger admit to your presence and councils the partisans of the duke of\nBurgundy, but select in their places good, loyal, and able men, such as\nmay be found in abundance in your kingdom.\n\n\u2018When these things shall be done, I will then, under God\u2019s pleasure,\nsend you such answer, that you may clearly know my inmost thoughts, and\nwhich shall prove satisfactory to God, to yourself, and to the world.\nFor the love of God, I pray you, my most redoubted lord, do not neglect\ndoing this; otherwise I see plainly, that whatever supplications or\nrequests I make to you will never be attended to, although they be\nconformable to reason and justice, and that you will be prevented from\nacting in the manner you have proposed, through your ambassadors to me,\nnor shall I be able to do what they have required from me on your part.\n\n\u2018Therefore, my most redoubted lord, I beg you will not disappoint\nme; for what I have required is but just and reasonable, as will be\napparent to any one. My very dear lord, may it please you to order me\naccording to your good pleasure, and, with the will of God, I will obey\nyou faithfully in all things.\u2019\n\nWhen the duke of Orleans had sent this letter to the king, he wrote\nothers of the like tenour to the chancellor of France, and to such\nof the ministers as he knew were favourable to him, to entreat that\nthey would earnestly exert themselves in pressing the king, queen, and\nduke of Acquitaine, to dismiss those of the council who governed under\nthe name of the duke of Burgundy, and whose names have been already\nnoticed,--and that he might obtain justice on the murderers of his\nlate father. Notwithstanding the many attempts he made by repeated\nletters to the king and to others, he could not at that time, through\nthe interposition before mentioned, obtain any answer which was\nsatisfactory.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XXVI.\n\n    THE DEATH OF THE DUKE OF BAR.--THE KING OF FRANCE SENDS AN\n    EMBASSY TO THE DUKE OF BURGUNDY,--AND OTHER MATTERS.\n\n\nIn this year died that valiant and wise man Henry duke of Bar, and was\nsucceeded by his eldest son Edward, marquis du Pont, in the duchy of\nBar and castlewick of Cassel, excepting a part which he had bequeathed\nas an inheritance, after his decease, to Robert de Bar, son to the\ndeceased Henry de Bar, his eldest son, and to the lady de Coucy,\nnamely, Varneston, Bourbourg, Dunkirk and Rhodes[68]. In consequence\nof his death, Edward was styled Duke of Bar, and began his reign\nprosperously.\n\nAt this period, the king of France sent ambassadors to the duke of\nBurgundy, who, beside what they delivered to him in speech, gave\nhim the letters which the duke of Orleans had written to the king,\ncontaining his charges against him and his accomplices. He was much\ndispleased at this conduct, and made reply by these ambassadors, that\nthe charges brought against him by the duke of Orleans were untrue.\nWhen he had received the ambassadors with every honour, he took leave\nof them, and went to his county of Flanders: and they returned to\nParis without any satisfactory answer to the matters concerning which\nthey had been sent.\n\nIt was not long before the duke of Burgundy raised a large body of men\nat arms, whom he sent into the Cambresis, and toward St Quentin; but\nimmediately after, by orders from the king and council, he dismissed\nthem to the places whence they had come.\n\nOn the 15th day of July, master John Petit, doctor of divinity, whom\nthe duke of Orleans had intended to prosecute, before the university\nof Paris, for heresy, died in the town of Hesdin, in the h\u00f4tel of\nthe hospital which the duke of Burgundy had given him, beside large\npensions, and was buried in the church of the Friars Minors in the town\nof Hesdin.\n\nAt this time, a tax was laid on the clergy of France and of Dauphiny,\nof half a tenth, by the pope, with the consent of the king, the\nprinces, and the university of Paris, and the greater part of the\nprelates and cities, to be paid by two instalments; the first on\nMagdalen day, and the second at Whitsuntide following. It was so\nrigorously collected that the poorer clergy complained bitterly.\n\nDuring this transaction, and while the duke of Burgundy was resident\nin his town of Bruges, on Saturday the 10th of July, sir Am\u00e9 de\nSarrebrusse, sir Clugnet de Brabant, and other captains of the duke of\nOrleans, came, with a numerous body of men at arms, before Coucy, in\nthe Vermandois, and Ham sur Somme.\n\nNews of this was soon carried to the duke of Burgundy, who, suspecting\nthey intended to invade and make war on his territories, gave\ncommissions to several of his captains, namely, the lord de Heilly,\nEnguerrand de Bournouville, the lord de Ront, and some others, to march\na body of men at arms towards Bapaume and Ham, to oppose the Armagnacs,\nshould they attempt to penetrate further into the country.\n\nDuring this time, the duke of Orleans and his brothers continued their\nsolicitations for justice, and again sent letters to the king, princes,\ncities, and prelates, to engage them to unite with them in obtaining\nthe object of their petitions. The tenour of the letter they wrote to\nthe king is as follows.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XXVII.\n\n    THE DUKE OF ORLEANS AND HIS BROTHERS SEND LETTERS TO THE KING\n    OF FRANCE, TO OTHER LORDS, AND TO SEVERAL OF THE PRINCIPAL\n    TOWNS IN FRANCE, TO COMPLAIN OF THE DUKE OF BURGUNDY.\n\n\n\u2018Most redoubted and sovereign lord,--we Charles duke of Orleans,\nPhilip count de Vertus, and John count of Angoul\u00eame, brothers, your\nvery humble children and nephews, have, with all due humiliation\nand submission, considered it right to lay before you, jointly and\nseparately, what follows.\n\n\u2018Although the barbarous and cruel murder of our redoubted lord and very\ndear father, your brother, must for certain be most strongly impressed\non your royal memory, and engraven on your heart,--nevertheless, most\nredoubted lord, our grief and the sense of what is due to us from all\nlaws, human and divine, force us to renew in your memory all the minute\ntransactions of that inhuman event.\n\n\u2018It is a fact, most dear lord, that John, who styles himself duke\nof Burgundy, through a hatred he had long nourished in his breast,\nand from an insatiate ambition and a desire of governing your realm,\nand that he might have the office of regent, as he has clearly shown\nand daily continues to show, did, on the 14th day of November in the\nyear 1407, most treacherously murder your brother, our most renowned\nlord and father, in the streets of Paris, and during the night, by\ncausing him to be waylaid by a set of infamous wretches, hired for this\npurpose, without having previously testified any displeasure towards\nhim. This is well known to all the world; for it has been publicly\navowed by the traitorous murderer himself, who is more disloyal, cruel,\nand inhuman than you can imagine; and we do not believe you can find in\nany writings one of a more perverse or faithless character.\n\n\u2018In the first place, they were so nearly connected by blood, being\ncousins-german, the children of two brothers, that it adds to his crime\nof murder that of parricide; and the laws cannot too severely punish\nso detestable an action. They were also brothers in arms, having twice\nor thrice renewed this confederation under their own hands and seals,\nand solemnly sworn on the holy sacrament, in the presence of very many\nprelates and nobles, that they would be true and loyal friends,--that\nthey would not do any thing to the prejudice of each other, either\nopenly or secretly, nor suffer any such like thing to be done by others.\n\n\u2018They, besides, entered into various protestations of love and\nfriendship, making the most solemn promises to continue true brothers\nin arms, as is usual in such cases, to demonstrate that they felt a\nperfect friendship for each other; and as a confirmation of their\naffection, they mutually wore each other\u2019s colours and badges.\n\n\u2018Secondly, he proved the perverseness of his heart by the manner in\nwhich this murder was committed. Under cover of his pretended affection\nfor your aforesaid brother, he conversed frequently with him; and once\nwhen he was ill, a short time before his death, he visited him at his\nhouse of Beaut\u00e9 sur Marne, and in Paris, showing him every sign of love\nand friendship that brother, cousin, or friend could testify,--when,\nat the same time, he had plotted his death, had sent for the murderers\nto Paris, and had even hired the house to hide them in, which clearly\ndemonstrates the wickedness and disloyalty of his heart.\n\n\u2018In addition to what I have just stated, and the very day before the\nmurder took place, after the council which you had held at the h\u00f4tel\nde St Pol was broken up, they both, in your presence and before the\nother princes of the blood who were there, drank wine and ate together;\nand your brother invited him to dine with him the Sunday following.\nThe duke of Burgundy accepted the invitation, although he knew what\na diabolical attempt he harboured in his heart, and that it would be\nput into effect the very first favourable opportunity. This is an\nabomination disgraceful even to relate.\n\n\u2018On the morrow, therefore, notwithstanding all his fair promises and\noaths, being obstinately bent upon his wicked purpose, he caused him to\nbe put to death with more cruelty than ever man of any rank suffered,\nby those whom he had hired to waylay and murder him, and who had, for\na long time, been watching their opportunity. They first cut off his\nright hand, which was found the next day in the dirt: they then cut his\nleft arm so that it held only by the skin, and, beside, fractured and\nlaid open his skull in several places that his brains were scattered\nin the street; and they then dragged his body through the mud, until it\nwas quite lifeless.\n\n\u2018It would be pitiful to hear of such barbarous conduct towards the\nmeanest subject: how much the more horror must the recital cause, when\nit was practised on the first prince of the blood of France! Never was\nany branch of your noble race so cruelly and infamously treated,--and\nyou and all of your blood, and such of your subjects as wish you well,\nought not to suffer such a lamentable deed to be perpetrated without\nany punishment or reparation whatever, as is the case till this present\ntime, which is the most shameful thing that ever happened, or ever\ncould happen, to so noble a house; and additional disgrace will fall\nupon it, if you any longer delay justice.\n\n\u2018Thirdly, he shows his perverseness and obstinacy by false and damnable\nhypocrisy; for after the horrid deed had been done, he came with the\nother princes dressed in black, to attend the body, pretending the\nutmost grief at the funeral for the loss of his brother in arms,\nthinking by this means to cover the wickedness of his sin. It would be\ntiresome to relate all the damnable and hypocritical arts he employed\nto hide the treacherous and murderous part he had acted, until he\nperceived that his crime must be brought to light by the diligence of\nyour officers of justice.\n\n\u2018He then, and then only, confessed to the king of Sicily, and to the\nduke of Berry, that he had perpetrated this murder, or at least had\ncaused it to be committed; and that the devil had tempted him to do\nit, for that in truth he could not assign any other cause for having\nso done. But he was not contented with murdering his body: he wanted\nagain, so great is his iniquity, to murder his fame and fair reputation\nby false and wicked accusations, when he was no more able to defend\nhimself against them. The falsehood of these charges, through the grace\nof God, is notorious to you and to the whole world.\n\n\u2018My late most redoubted lady-mother, whose soul may God receive!\nsuffered the utmost tribulation, not only for the death of her\nmuch-beloved lord and husband, but also for the inhuman and cruel\nmanner of it; and like one in despair, attended by me, John of\nAngoul\u00eame, she waited on you, as her king and sovereign lord, and\nher sole refuge in this her distress, and most humbly supplicated\nthat you would, out of your benign goodness, have compassion on her\nand her children, and would order such prompt and just judgment to\nbe executed on the perpetrators of this murder as the blackness of\nthe case required; and as you are bound in your quality of king to\nadminister strict justice to all your subjects without delay, as well\nto the poor as to the rich, so rather the more promptly ought you to\nexercise it in favour of the poor and deserted than for the rich and\npowerful; for this upright administration of justice is a great virtue,\nand on this account were kings chiefly appointed, and power intrusted\nto their hands. The case that was then and is now again brought before\nyou requires the most speedy justice; for it not only concerns you as\nking, but affects you more sensibly and personally,--for her husband,\nour much regretted lord, who was so treacherously slain, was your only\nbrother, and, consequently, strict justice ought to have been granted\nto her, and done on the murderers.\n\n\u2018You did indeed appoint a day for doing her this justice; on which\naccount, she constantly employed her agents near your person, to\nremind you thereof: she waited long after the appointed day had elapsed\nfor the judgment which you had promised her,--and, notwithstanding all\nher diligence and exertions, she met with nothing but delays, caused by\nthe means of the aforesaid traitor, his friends and adherents, as shall\nbe more fully explained hereafter.\n\n\u2018However, most redoubted lord, I know for certain, that your\ninclinations were very willing to do us justice, and that they still\nremain the same. Our most afflicted mother, attended by me Charles of\nOrleans, again returned; and we renewed our request to have judgment\nexecuted on the assassins of our late lord and father. We also caused\nto be most fully detailed before my lord of Acquitaine, your eldest\nson, and by you commissioned as your lieutenant on this occasion, and\nbefore the queen, every circumstance relative to the murder, and the\ninfamous charges urged by way of exculpation by the murderer, and the\ncauses why he had committed this atrocious crime. We, at the same time,\nfully replied to what had been argued in his defence; and after this,\nour lady-mother caused conclusions to be drawn against the aforesaid\ntraitor, according to the usual customs of your reign, and required\nthat your attorney should join with her in the further prosecution of\nthe criminals, so that they might be brought to justice.\n\n\u2018When this was done, our very redoubted lord the duke of Acquitaine,\nby the advice of the princes of your blood and divers others of your\ncouncil, then present at the Louvre, made answer to our lady-mother,\nthat, as your lieutenant, he and the princes of the blood, and\nthe members of your council, were satisfied, and pleased with the\njustifications offered by our lady-mother in behalf of your brother,\nour much redoubted father, whose soul may God pardon! and that they\nconsidered him as fully innocent of the charges brought against him,\nand added, that substantial justice should be done to her satisfaction.\n\n\u2018Notwithstanding all these promises, there was much delay in their\nexecution, insomuch that she frequently renewed her solicitations\nto you, the princes of your blood, and to your council, and used\nvarious other means to obtain justice, the recital of which would\ntire you: nevertheless, she could never gain the assistance of your\nattorney-general in prosecuting the aforesaid criminals to judgment,\nwhich circumstance is lamentable to think on.\n\n\u2018For the aforesaid traitor, well knowing your inclination to execute\njustice, knowing also that his crime could by no means be justified, in\norder to prevent matters being pushed to extremity, (notwithstanding\nyour positive orders to him, to forbid his appearing at Paris, with any\nbody of men at arms) came thither with a powerful force, composed of\nforeigners, and several who had been banished your realm, who did great\nmischief to the countries through which they passed, as is notorious to\nevery one.\n\n\u2018Your and our lady the queen, with the duke of Acquitaine, your son\nand heir, and the princes of the blood, were forced to quit your\ncapital before he arrived there. He remained, therefore, in your\ntown of Paris lord paramount, and conducted himself in a tyrannical\nmanner, subversive of your dominion, and contrary to the interests\nof the people. To avoid greater inconveniences and oppressions on\nyour subjects from him and his men at arms, it was judged expedient\nthat you, the royal family and council of state should, according to\nhis good pleasure, come to Chartres, and there grant him whatever\nhe should ask. Thus he thought he should be acquitted of all the\ntraitorous acts and murders which he had committed, by trampling your\njustice under his feet. Consequently he refuses to suffer any of your\nofficers to take cognizance of his crimes, and has not condescended to\nhumiliate himself before you, whom he has troubled and offended more\nthan can be told. He is not, therefore, capable of receiving any grace\nby law or reason; nor worthy of being admitted to your presence, and\nhaving any favours shown to him or to his dependants and friends. He\nshould have presented himself before you in all humility and contrition\nfor his offences; whereas he has done precisely the contrary, and has\nso obstinately persisted in his wickedness that he has had the boldness\nto avow to yourself publicly, and before so great an assembly as met at\nChartres, that he put your only brother to death for your welfare and\nthat of the state.\n\n\u2018He wishes also to maintain, that you told him you were not displeased\nthat it had been done. This has shocked every loyal ear that has heard\nit, and will shock still more the generations to come, who shall read\nand learn that a king of France (the greatest monarch in Christendom)\nshould not have been displeased at the most inhuman and traitorous\nmurder of his only brother.\n\n\u2018This is so manifestly treason of the deepest die against your\nown honour, and that of your crown and kingdom, that scarcely any\npunishments ordered by law and justice are capable of making reparation\nfor it. It is also greatly prejudicial to the far-famed justice of your\ncourts of law.\n\n\u2018Notwithstanding the excuses which he made to you, that the murder\nof your brother had been committed for your personal security, and\nthe good of your kingdom, it is notorious, that it had been plotted\na very long time, through his immeasurable ambition of obtaining the\ngovernment of your realm, as I have before stated. He has declared to\nseveral of his dependants and officers, that there never before was\ncommitted in this country so base a murder; and yet, in his defence, he\nsays it was done for the public good, and for your personal safety.\n\n\u2018It is therefore very clear, according to law and equity, that every\nthing done at Chartres on that day is null and void; and what perhaps\nis as deserving of punishment as the commission of the crime itself\nis, that he never deigned to pay you any honour, respect, or condolence\nfor such a loss as that of your brother, nor ever once solicited\npardon, or any remission for his offence whatever. And he wishes to\nmaintain, that without confessing his guilt, and without demanding\npardon, you have remitted all further proceedings against him, which is\ncontrary to all equity and written laws,--a mere illusion, or rather a\nderision of justice, namely, thus to leave a murderer, without taking\nany cognizance of his crime, without penitence or contrition, and\nto prosecute no inquiry into his conduct, and, what is worse, when\nsuch a criminal obstinately perseveres in his wickedness, even in the\npresence of his sovereign lord. On that same day, however, he fell\ninto a manifest and apparent contradiction; for he says that he has\ndone well, and consequently he assumes to himself merit, and requires\nremuneration,--and, nevertheless, he pretends to say that you have\ngiven him pardon and remission, which circumstance implies not good\ndeeds and merit, but a crime and offence.\n\n\u2018He has never offered any prayers for the salvation of the soul of the\ndeceased, nor any remuneration to those who have suffered from the\nloss caused by him; and this you ought not, and cannot in any manner\npardon.\n\n\u2018Thus it clearly appears, that what was done at Chartres was contrary\nto every principle of law, equity, reason and justice; whence it again\nfollows, that from this, and other causes too long to be detailed, all\nthe proceedings at Chartres are null and of no effect. Should any one\nmaintain, that the treaty made at Chartres is good and binding, it may\nvery easily be shown, that this aforesaid traitor has infringed the\narticles of it in various ways, and has been the first to violate it.\n\n\u2018Although you had ordered, that henceforth he should in no way act to\nour prejudice, and although he had sworn to observe it,--nevertheless\nhe did directly the contrary; for, thinking to damn the good fame of\nour very redoubted lord and father, he caused your grand master of\nthe household, whose soul may God receive! to be arrested, thrown\ninto close imprisonment, and inhumanly tortured, so that his limbs\nwere broken, and made him suffer other martyrdom that he might,\nthrough the severity of torture, force him to confess that our\never-to-be-regretted lord and father, and your only brother, whose\nsoul may God pardon! was guilty of some of the charges which he had\nfalsely brought against him, so that his crimes might be excused, and\nthat he might for ever destroy the honour of our family.\n\n\u2018He had the grand master carried to the place of execution, who there,\nwhen death was before his eyes, declared, on the damnation of his soul\nif he told a falsehood, that he had never in his life seen any thing\ntreasonable in the conduct of the late duke of Orleans, or any thing\nthat tended to the hurt of any individual,--but that he had always most\nloyally served you: and should he have said any thing to the contrary\nwhen under torture, it must have been his sufferings that forced him to\nutter what he thought would please his tormentors. What he now said was\nthe real truth, and he uttered it on the peril of damnation; and this\nhe persevered in to the moment of his execution, in the hearing of many\nknights and other respectable persons.\n\n\u2018This plainly demonstrates, that the duke of Burgundy\u2019s conduct was\nprecisely the reverse to what he had sworn to observe when at Chartres.\n\n\u2018He has received into his h\u00f4tel and supported, and continues daily\nso to do, the murderers who slew your brother, although they were\nespecially excepted out of the treaty concluded at Chartres. He\nlikewise, as is notorious, troubles the officers and servants of our\nlate lord and father, who now appertain to us, and dismisses them from\nall the employments which they held under your government, without any\nother cause whatever but his hatred to us and to our house, and to\nthose servants who are attached to us. He even attempted not only to\nruin them in their fortunes, but to take away their lives by means too\ntedious to relate; but the facts are notorious.\n\n\u2018The traitor, therefore, sensible of the horror of his criminal\ncruelty, and that he could not by any means palliate it, has usurped\nthe government of your kingdom (for the sole cause of his murdering\nyour brother was his unbounded ambition),--and, by so doing,\neffectually prevents your officers of justice from taking cognizance\nof his crimes, and likewise creates infinite grief to all your loyal\nsubjects and wellwishers.\n\n\u2018He detains your royal person, as well as that of my lord the duke of\nAcquitaine, in such subjection that no one, however high his rank, can\nhave access to you, whatever may be his business, without first having\nobtained permission from those whom he has placed around you, and has\nthus driven from you and your family several faithful and valiant\nservants long attached to you, and filled their places with his own\ncreatures, and in great part with foreigners and persons unknown to\nyou. In like manner, he has acted toward my lord of Acquitaine.\n\n\u2018He has also displaced your officers,--in particular, such as held\nthe principal posts in your realm; and as for your finances, he has\nlavished them here and there according to his will and pleasure, but\ngreatly to his own advantage, and not at all for the good of yourself,\nor for the relief of your people, which has caused much discontent\nagainst you. The underlings in office he has sorely vexed, under\nfeigned pretences of justice, and has robbed them of their fortunes,\nwhich he has applied to his own proper use, as is well known throughout\nParis and elsewhere.\n\n\u2018In short, he has introduced such a licentiousness of manners into the\nkingdom that all sorts of crimes are committed, without inquiry or\npunishment following them; and thus, from default or neglect of justice\nbeing done on this enormous and detestable murderer, many other murders\nhave been committed with impunity in different parts of the realm,\nsince the melancholy death of our much-regretted lord and father,\nmurderers and other criminals saying, \u2018Our crimes will be passed over,\nsince no notice has been taken of him who slew the king\u2019s brother.\u2019\n\n\u2018On this account, most redoubted lord, my lord of Berry your uncle,\nthe duke of Bourbon, the count d\u2019Alen\u00e7on, the counts de Clermont and\nd\u2019Armagnac, and I Charles of Orleans, wishing to testify our loyalty to\nyou, as we are bound by parentage, and being your very humble subjects,\nhad intended coming to you last year to lay before you the damnable\ngovernment of your kingdom, and to remonstrate, that should it continue\nlonger, it must end in the destruction of yourself, your family, and\nyour realm.\n\n\u2018In order, therefore, that you may hear us as well as such as may\nmaintain the contrary, let there be chosen a sufficient number of\ndiscreet men to examine into the grievances we complain of; and let a\nremedy be applied to them, providing first for the security of your\nroyal person, and for that of my lord of Acquitaine. This was more\nfully explained in the proclamations issued previously to our coming\nto Paris, when, for our personal safety, we were accompanied by our\nfriends and vassals, all of them your subjects; and our only object in\nthus coming was the welfare of yourself and your kingdom.\n\n\u2018We offered to wait on you with very few attendants, but we could\nnever obtain access to you, nor have a single audience, through the\nobstructions of this traitor, who was alway by your side; and he alone\nprevented the goodness of our intentions being made known to you,\nfrom his persevering ambition and his boundless desire of seizing the\ngovernment of yourself and realm.\n\n\u2018We, therefore, finding all hopes of seeing you fruitless, in\nconsequence of agreements concluded with your council, returned home;\nbut to avoid, if possible, the destruction of your country, we must\nagain confederate.--We faithfully observed all the articles of the\nagreement; but we were no sooner at a distance than our enemy violated\nthem in the most essential part. It had been settled that your new\nministry should be composed of men of unblemished characters, who were\nnot partisans or servants, or pensioners to either side; but he has\nkept those that were attached to him in power, so that he has now a\nmajority in the council, and consequently rules more despotically and\nmore securely than when he held the reins of government in his own hand.\n\n\u2018These grievances are increasing, and will increase, unless God shall\ndirect your mind to provide a remedy to them.\n\n\u2018Pierre des Essars, who had been provost of your good town of Paris,\nand minister of finance, was to be deprived of these offices, and of\nevery employment he held under your name. This was done for a short\ntime,--but he has since obtained for him, by letters sealed with\nyour great seal, a re-appointment to the provostship, under pretence\nof which the said Pierre des Essars has returned to Paris, and has\nattempted by force to execute the duties of that office. He came, in\nfact, to the court of the Ch\u00e2telet, seated himself on the judgment\nseat, and took possession of his office with the knowledge and\nconnivance of the duke of Burgundy,--and it was not his fault, if he\nfailed in success.\n\n\u2018Hence it appears plainly, that the late arrangements have been by\nhim, and those of his party, violated; and that he never had any real\nintentions of keeping the treaty is clear from his having consented to\nthe dismission of Pierre des Essars, and then secretly procuring his\nrestitution. It was also stipulated in this treaty, that all who had\nbeen deprived of their offices for having been in the company of me,\nCharles d\u2019Orleans, and the other lords, at the h\u00f4tel of Winchester,\nshould be restored to them; and that, by your orders, and those of your\ncouncil, sir John de Charencieres was to be replaced in his government\nof your town and castle of Caen,--nevertheless, the duke of Burgundy,\nin opposition to these your orders, had him displaced, and solicited\nthe appointment for himself, from hatred to sir John de Charencieres,\nand, having obtained it, now holds it, which is another infringement of\nthe treaty.\n\n\u2018Notwithstanding, most redoubted lord and sovereign, all the diligence\nand exertions made by our much-loved mother, whose soul may God\npardon! to obtain justice on the murderers of our late very dear\nfather, four years have now elapsed without any judgment being passed\non such enormous criminals, although she pursued every means in her\npower.\n\n\u2018In consequence of this failure or neglect, I, Charles of Orleans, have\nof late most humbly supplicated you to grant me warrants against these\naforesaid murderers, addressed to all your justices, that they might,\non due examination of the charges, imprison and punish, according to\nthe exigency of the case, all or any who may have been implicated in\nthis abominable crime. In this I made not any extraordinary request;\nfor justice is due to all your subjects, and cannot be refused them:\nyou cannot believe that any man, however low his rank, in your kingdom,\nwould have a similar request neglected by your courts of justice, for\nI know it could not be refused. However, in spite of every exertion I\ncould make, I have never yet been able to obtain these warrants, the\nreason of which is, as I suppose, that some of your new ministers are\nimplicated in the crime I am anxious to have punished, and therefore\nwill not suffer such warrants to be issued.\n\n\u2018For this reason, therefore, most redoubted lord, have I of\nlate earnestly supplicated you, that you would, from personal\nconsiderations, and for the good of your realm, dismiss from your\nservice the persons named in my letter,--for I therein charged them\nwith having obstructed public justice and disturbed the peace of the\ncountry. When this should be done, I declared to your ambassadors,\nthat I was willing, from my love to your person and attachment to your\nkingdom, to make publicly known my future intentions, and that my\nconduct should be such as would have the approbation of God and of your\nmajesty; but notwithstanding this, I have not yet had any satisfactory\nanswer to all my repeated solicitations for justice on the murderers of\nmy late regretted lord and father.\n\n\u2018We, therefore, most redoubted lord, again make our petitions that the\naforesaid criminals may be brought to that justice which is due to them\nfor the enormity of their offences; the principal having made a public\nconfession of his guilt in the presence of my lord of Acquitaine, who\npresided, in your absence, at the meeting held at his request in the\nh\u00f4tel de St Pol, and before a numerous body of the nobility, clergy\nand others; and the traitor cannot deny that this his confession was\nmade before a competent judge, and in the presence of such witnesses as\nthe king of Sicily and my lord of Berry your uncle.\n\n\u2018He had before privately confessed to these two persons, that he had\ncommitted the murder without any cause whatever, but through the\ninstigation of the enemy of mankind. This confession, according to\nevery law, ought to be to his prejudice, nor should he be suffered to\noffer any excuse in extenuation of a crime thus publicly and privately\navowed; for he has condemned himself, and ought to have judgment passed\non him accordingly.\n\n\u2018It is very apparent, that such confession requires not any further\nproceedings but the passing of that sentence which the enormity of the\ncrime deserves. Notwithstanding this, our much-regretted lady-mother\nand ourselves have never been able, with all our exertions, to overcome\nthe premeditated delays to obstruct justice; for three years and a half\nare elapsed since we first brought the matter before you, and we are\nnot one step more advanced to the attainment of judgment than we were\nthen. It is painful to consider what may be the consequence of this\nwilful delay of justice to the welfare of your kingdom, and that the\nmost dangerous consequences may ensue, unless a speedy and decisive\nremedy be applied.\n\n\u2018May it therefore please your grace to do your loyal duty, in executing\nthis act of justice, in obedience to God your Creator, to whom judgment\nappertains, and from whom you hold your authority. Have regard also to\nthe good government of your realm, and exert yourself to put an end\nto every obstacle in the way of a just punishment on the traitor. We\nmost earnestly supplicate you to comply with this our request as soon\nas possible, for we are bounden to press you to it, to the utmost of\nour powers, under pain of not being reputed the children of our late\nlamented father, and of being disgraced, and unworthy of bearing his\nname and arms, and of succeeding to his honours and estates: such\ndishonour we will never endure, but would rather suffer death, as ought\nto be the determination of every man of noble heart, of whatever rank\nor estate he may be.\n\n\u2018We therefore entreat you, with all possible humility, that for this\npurpose, and also in order to resist and oppose his wicked intention\nto destroy us by any means whatsoever, it may please you, from your\nbenignant grace, to aid, assist and abet by your power, us to whom\nGod hath vouchsafed so great favour as to cause us to be born your\nrelations, even of your own kin, and your true nephews, children of\nyour only brother,--or, to speak more properly, assist your only\nbrother, who has fallen a martyr to the ambitious views of this\ntraitor. Most redoubted lord, there is no man so poor, who, having had\nhis brother murdered, will not prosecute the murderer to death, and\nthe more earnestly as the criminal displays greater obstinacy. This is\nexemplified in the conduct of our traitor; for it is notorious, that he\nhas dared to write, and to declare to many respectable persons, that he\nslew your brother, whom God pardon! our much-redoubted lord and father,\nfairly and meritoriously. In answer to which, I Charles of Orleans say,\nthat he lies, and I at present decline to make a more ample reply,--for\nit is very manifest, as I have before explained, that he is a liar, and\na false disloyal traitor, and that, through the grace of God, I am, and\never will be without reproach, and a teller of truth.\n\n\u2018Since, therefore, such things cannot fail of being very prejudicial to\nyour realm and to the public welfare, we beseech you most humbly to do\nus that justice which you are bounden to do, and to assist us by every\nmeans in your power, that we may have full and ample reparation for the\nwrongs done us and our family, and that this murder may be punished in\nthe manner it deserves. In acting thus, you will acquit yourself toward\nGod our Creator, and execute justice, of which you are the supreme\nhead, to whom we must have recourse after God.\n\n\u2018That you, our most redoubted lord, may be assured that the contents of\nthis letter are from our free will and knowledge, we, Charles, Philip\nand John, your most humble children and nephews, have each of us signed\nit with our own hands. Written at Gergeau, the 10th day of July, in the\nyear 1411.\u2019\n\nThis letter was sent, by a herald of the duke of Orleans, to the king\nat Paris, and was laid before the whole of the council, where different\nopinions were held as to the contents. Some wished that the brothers\nshould have their requests complied with, and that the duke of Burgundy\nshould be summoned, that they might hear what he had to say in his\ndefence to the charges which they should make against him. But at\nlength the business was postponed, and the duke of Orleans could not\nobtain any favourable answer; for the greater part of those who ruled\nthe king and the duke of Acquitaine were favourers of the duke of\nBurgundy, to whom they shortly after sent a copy of the above letter.\n\nThe duke of Burgundy, on reading it, was convinced that the family of\nOrleans and their friends would very soon declare war against him;\nand in consequence, he immediately began to make every preparation to\noppose them, by forming magazines of stores, and engaging a numerous\nbody of men at arms, in various parts of his possessions.\n\nThe duke of Orleans and his brothers had not only written to the king\nof France, and to the princes of the blood, but also to the principal\ntowns, making complaint against the duke of Burgundy, and requiring\ntheir support. When they perceived that the king and his ministers did\nnot intend to answer their letter, they again wrote to the great towns,\ngiving them to understand, that if redress were not granted them in the\nlegal manner, as they had demanded it, they should seek other means of\nobtaining it.\n\nIt was now ordered by the king, the queen, and the duke of Berry,\nand others of weight in the council, that measures should be adopted\nfor appeasing the quarrels of the dukes of Orleans and of Burgundy.\nAmbassadors were sent to each of the parties, but without success,\nprincipally because the duke of Burgundy would not condescend to make\nany other reparation than what had passed at the treaty of Chartres;\nand his pride was increased by having the king and the duke of\nAcquitaine on his side.\n\nThe Orleans-party were much discontented, but not dismayed; for many\nvery considerable lords were with them, and had promised them aid and\nsupport against the duke of Burgundy to the utmost of their powers. The\nqueen, therefore, and the others employed to negotiate a peace between\nthe two factions, finding their attempts fruitless, gave it up, and on\na certain day made a report to the king of what they had done, and the\nanswers they had received from both parties. Shortly after, the duke\nof Orleans and his faction resolved to make mortal war on the duke of\nBurgundy and his allies, and sent him their challenges by a herald.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XXVIII.\n\n    THE DUKE OF ORLEANS AND HIS BROTHERS SEND A CHALLENGE TO THE\n    DUKE OF BURGUNDY, IN HIS TOWN OF DOUAY.\n\n\nThe following is the tenour of the challenge sent by the three brothers\nof Orleans to the duke of Burgundy, in consequence of the murder of\ntheir late father, the duke of Orleans.\n\n\u2018Charles, duke of Orleans and of Valois, count of Blois and of\nBeaumont, and lord of Coucy, Philip count of Vertus, John count of\nAngoul\u00eame, brothers,--to thee, John, who callest thyself duke of\nBurgundy.\n\n\u2018For the very horrible murder by thee committed (in treacherously\nwaylaying by assassins) on the person of our most redoubted lord and\nfather, Louis duke of Orleans, only brother to my lord the king, our\nsovereign and thine, in spite of all the divers oaths of brotherhood\nand fellowship thou hadst sworn to him; and for the numberless\ntreacheries and disloyal acts that thou hast perpetrated, as well\nagainst our sovereign lord the king as against ourselves, we thus\nacquaint thee, that we shall make war upon and distress thee and thine\nby every possible means in our power.\n\n\u2018And we appeal to God and justice against thy disloyalty and treason,\nand call for the assistance of every worthy man in this world. In\ntestimony whereof, and to assure thee of its truth, we have subjoined\nthe seal of me Charles of Orleans to these presents. Given at Gergeau,\nthe 18th day of July.\u2019\n\nThe above letter was delivered to the duke of Burgundy by a herald\nin his town of Douay, who, having considered its contents, wrote the\nfollowing answer, which he sent by one of his heralds at arms to the\naforesaid brothers.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XXIX.\n\n    THE DUKE OF BURGUNDY SENDS AN ANSWER TO THE CHALLENGE OF THE\n    DUKE OF ORLEANS AND HIS BROTHERS.\n\n\n\u2018John duke of Burgundy, count of Artois, of Flanders, palatine of\nBurgundy, lord of Salines and of Malines,--to thee Charles, who stylest\nthyself duke of Orleans and Valois,--and to thee Philip, who signest\nthyself count of Vertus,--and to thee John, who callest thyself count\nof Angoul\u00eame, who have lately sent me your letters of defiance.\n\n\u2018We make known to you, and to all the world, that to put an end to the\nabominable treasons and mischiefs that were daily plotted in various\nways, against the person of our sovereign lord and king, and against\nall his royal offspring, by Louis your father, and to prevent your\nfalse and disloyal father from succeeding in his abominable designs\nagainst the person of our and his most redoubted lord and sovereign,\nwhich were become so notorious that no honest man ought to have\nsuffered him to live, more especially we who are cousin-german to\nour lord the king, dean of the peerage, and twice a peer[69], felt it\nincumbent on us not to permit such a person longer to exist on the\nearth, and, by putting an end to his life, have done pleasure to God,\nand a most loyal service to our sovereign lord, in destroying a vile\nand disloyal traitor.\n\n\u2018And since thou and thy brothers are following the detestable traces\nand felony of your said father, thinking to succeed in the aforesaid\ndamnable attempts, we have received your challenge with great gladness\nof heart. But in regard to the charges therein made against us, we\ndeclare ye have falsely and wickedly lied, like disloyal traitors as\nye are; and with the assistance of our sovereign, who is perfectly\nwell acquainted and satisfied with our loyalty and honour, and for the\nwelfare of his people, we will inflict that punishment on you as such\nabandoned traitors and wicked rebels are deserving of. In witness of\nwhich, we have had this letter sealed with our seal. Given at our town\nof Douay, the 14th day of August, in the year 1411.\u2019\n\nThis answer, as I have before said, was carried by one of the duke of\nBurgundy\u2019s officers at arms to Blois, and there delivered to the duke\nof Orleans and his brothers, who were very indignant at the expressions\ncontained therein. He nevertheless entertained the bearer well, and,\nhaving maturely considered the matter, exerted himself to the utmost in\ncollecting men at arms to wage war on the duke of Burgundy.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XXX.\n\n    THE DUKE OF BURGUNDY IS DISCONTENTED WITH SIR MANSART DU\n    BOS.--HE SENDS LETTERS TO REQUIRE THE ASSISTANCE OF THE DUKE OF\n    BOURBON.\n\n\nWhen the duke of Burgundy was convinced that he could not avoid war\nwith the family of Orleans and their adherents, for several of them had\nchallenged him by letters and otherwise, he vigorously applied himself\nto collect forces to resist them. Among those who had sent him letters\nof defiance, he was more displeased with sir Mansart du Bos, a knight\nof Picardy, than with any of the rest; but of him, and his end, more\nshall be said hereafter.\n\nHe wrote a letter to the duke of Bourbon, which he sent by Flanders\nking at arms, the contents of which were as follow:\n\n\u2018Very dear and well-beloved cousin, duke of Bourbon and count of\nClermont,--John duke of Burgundy, count of Artois, Flanders and\nBurgundy, hopes he remains well in your good memory. In the year 1405,\nyou and he formed certain alliances, which, three years ago, were,\nat your request, renewed and again sworn to, in the presence of many\nknights and of other persons well deserving credit. In consequence, you\nwere to remain my good and true friend during your life, to promote to\nthe utmost my welfare and honour, and to ward off any evil from me, as\na sincere relation is bound to do; and likewise, whenever any thing\nshould affect my own honour, or that of my friends, you were bound\nto assist them or me, to the utmost of your abilities, in council or\nin arms, and to aid me with money and vassals against all the world,\nexcepting only the persons of my lord the king and of my lord of\nAcquitaine, or whoever may succeed to the throne of France, and of my\nlate fair cousin, the duke of Bourbon, your father.\n\n\u2018Should it have happened that a war took place between me and any\nenemy, whose side the late duke of Bourbon embraced, in that case you\nmight have joined your late father, but only during the course of\nhis life, without any way derogating from the articles of our said\nalliance. Now, as we both have most solemnly sworn to the observance\nof this alliance on the holy evangelists of God, and on sacred relics\ntouched by us, to the damnation of our souls in case of failure, I\ninform you, very dear and well-beloved cousin, that Charles, who calls\nhimself duke of Orleans, in conjunction with Philip and John, his\nbrothers, have sent me a challenge, and intend to wage war on me to the\nutmost of their power; but I hope, through the will of God, and the\nassistance of my friends and allies, in council and in arms, and with\nthe aid of my subjects and vassals, to make a successful defence of my\nhonour against their attempts.\n\n\u2018And since, very dear and well-beloved cousin, you have so solemnly\nbound yourself to assist me on every lawful occasion, I now,\ntherefore, in virtue of this alliance, require and summon you to come\npersonally to my aid, attended by as many of your friends and men\nat arms as you can collect, in opposition to the aforesaid Charles,\nPhilip and John, and thus honourably acquit yourself of your oaths and\npromises,--knowing, at the same time, that on a similar occasion I\nwould accomplish every article of my oaths, without any fraud whatever.\nAnd this I hope you will do.--Have the goodness to write to me by the\nreturn of the bearer, to inform me of your pleasure and intentions, as\nthe necessity of the case requires it.\n\n\u2018Given at my town of Douay, and sealed with my great seal appendant to\nthese presents, the 14th day of August, in the year 1411.\u2019\n\nThis letter was delivered by the aforesaid herald to the duke of\nBourbon, who, having fully read and considered its contents, replied\nto the herald, that he would speedily send his answer to the duke of\nBurgundy. This he did; for in a few days he returned the articles of\nconfederation, which he had formed with the duke of Burgundy, declaring\nthem annulled, and strictly united himself to the duke of Orleans and\nhis brothers, to the great displeasure of the duke of Burgundy, but\nwho at that time could not redress it.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XXXI.\n\n    A ROYAL PROCLAMATION IS ISSUED, THAT NO PERSON WHATEVER BEAR\n    ARMS FOR EITHER OF THE PARTIES OF THE DUKES OF ORLEANS OR OF\n    BURGUNDY.--THE LATTER WRITES TO THE BAILIFF OF AMIENS.\n\n\nThe duke of Burgundy, fearful that many of his friends would desert\nhim, in obedience of the royal proclamation which had been made in\nevery town and bailiwick through France, strictly commanding all\npersons whatever not to interfere, or in any manner to assist the\ndukes of Orleans and Burgundy in their quarrels with each other, wrote\nletters to the bailiff of Amiens, to his lieutenant, and the mayor and\nsheriffs of that place, and to each of them, the contents of which were\nas follows:\n\n\u2018Very dear and well-beloved,--we have heard from several of the\ndeclaration of my lord the king, by which you are forbidden, as well\nas all his other subjects, to arm in our defence, or in that of our\nadversaries. This proclamation has been issued by our lord the king,\nbecause he was very desirous of establishing peace and concord between\nus and our enemies; and for this purpose he had many times sent his\nambassadors as well to them as to us, to which we have alway replied\nlike a true and loyal subject and servant; and, through God\u2019s mercy,\nall our answers have tended to a good end, and to peace and union,\nwhich has made them perfectly agreeable to our lord the king. But our\nadversaries having persisted in the same damnable and wicked purposes,\nwhich they have ever followed against the peace of my lord the king,\nhis noble family, and the public welfare, by continuing to tread in\nthe footsteps of their father, who, for a long time, persevered in\nhis intentions of destroying my lord the king and his family, have\nacted quite contrariwise, and sent answers full of dissimulation and\ntreachery, with the sole design of gaining time.\n\n\u2018Whilst our much-redoubted lady the queen of France, our very dear\nlord and uncle the duke of Berry, and our very dear brother the duke\nof Brittany, were endeavouring, according to the king\u2019s orders, to\nnegotiate a peace between us and our adversaries, these false and\ndisloyal traitors, and disobedient subjects, Charles, who calls himself\nduke of Orleans, and his brothers, sent to us their challenges, and,\nbefore that time, have often scandalously, and in violation of their\noaths, defamed our person and character as they had before done. This,\nhowever, under God\u2019s pleasure, will fail in having any effect, for he\nwho knows all hearts is acquainted with the steady love and attachment\nwe bear, and shall bear so long as we live, to our lord the king and\nto his family, and to the welfare of his kingdom; and we shall ever\nsupport the same with all the worldly possessions and powers that God\nhas bestowed upon us.\n\n\u2018With these views we have done and commanded such acts as have been\ndone, without paying regard to the scandalous defamations that have\nbeen thrown out against us, or any way fearing a diminution of honour\nby such false, wicked, and disobedient traitors to our lord the king,\nas the aforesaid Charles and his brothers, the issue of that infamous\ntraitor, their father, so notorious throughout the realm.\n\n\u2018In truth, we hold it not to have been the intention of our lord the\nking to prevent any of our relatives, friends, allies, subjects, and\nwell-inclined vassals, from joining us, in the defence of our honour,\nagainst our enemies, and to defend our countries from invasion.\n\n\u2018We therefore entreat of you, and require most affectionately, that\nyou will please to allow such as may be inclined to serve us, who live\nwithin your bailiwick, and all others of our friends who may travel\nthrough it, to pass freely without any molestation whatever; for you\nmay be assured, that what we shall do will be for the welfare and\nsecurity of my lord the king, his family, and the whole kingdom, to the\nconfusion of all disloyal traitors.\n\n\u2018Should there be any thing that we could do to give you pleasure,\nyou have but to signify it to us, and we will do it with our whole\nheart.--Very dear and good friends, may the Holy Spirit have you under\nhis care! Written in our town of Douay, the 13th day of August.\u2019\n\nThese letters were very agreeable to Ferry de Hangest, then bailiff of\nAmiens, and to the others to whom they had been addressed, for they\nwere well inclined to favour the duke of Burgundy.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XXXII.\n\n    THE PARISIANS TAKE UP ARMS AGAINST THE ARMAGNACS.--A CIVIL WAR\n    BREAKS OUT IN SEVERAL PARTS OF FRANCE.\n\n\nAt this time the king of France, who had for a considerable time\nenjoyed good health, relapsed into his former disorder; on which\naccount, and by reason of the discontents that prevailed throughout\nthe kingdom, (the seat of government had been transferred to Melon,)\nthe butchers of Paris, who have greater power and privileges than any\nother trade, suspecting that the government of the realm, through\nthe intrigues of the queen and the provost of merchants, named\nCharles Cudane, would be given to the dukes of Berry and Brittany, in\npreference to the duke of Acquitaine, the king\u2019s eldest son, waited\nupon the latter, and exhorted him, notwithstanding his youth, to assume\nthe government for the good of the king and kingdom, promising him\ntheir most loyal aid until death. The duke of Acquitaine inclined to\ntheir request, and granted them their wishes.\n\nThis done, they ordered it to be proclaimed by sound of trumpet in all\nthe squares of Paris, that the provost of merchants, and others in\nParis, who were numerous, and whom they suspected of being favourable\nto the dukes of Berry, Bourbon, and Brittany, and to their parties,\nmust quit the town before a fixed day, under pain of suffering death.\nIn consequence of this proclamation, twelve persons, men and women,\nwithout including the domestics of the above lords, left Paris; and\nshortly after, the duke of Brittany, hearing of these commotions, took\nleave of the queen at Melun and retired into his duchy.\n\nThe butchers, and those who lived near the market-places, with the\ngreater part of the Parisians, were strong partisans of the duke of\nBurgundy, and very desirous that only he, or those that were of his\nparty, should govern the kingdom; and, to say the truth, it was now\nbecome dangerous for the nobility, of whatever party they might be, to\ndwell in Paris, for the common people had great sway in its government.\n\nIn the mean time, the duke of Orleans and his allies were strengthening\nthemselves, by every means in their power, with men at arms. The duke\nof Bourbon and the count d\u2019Alen\u00e7on came in these days with a numerous\nbody before the town of Roye in the Vermandois, which belongs to the\nking of France, and entered it about mid-day, more through fraud than\nby force of arms, for the townsmen did not suspect any warfare. When\nthey had dined, they sent for the principal inhabitants, and ordered\nthem, whether it were pleasing to them or otherwise, to receive a\ngarrison from them. They then rode to Nesle, in the Vermandois,\nbelonging to the count de Dammartin, wherein they also placed a\ngarrison.\n\nThence they dispatched sir Clugnet de Brabant, who had joined them, sir\nManessier Guieret, and other captains well attended, to the town of\nHam in the Vermandois, belonging to the duke of Orleans: they returned\nby Chauni sur Oise, where they also left a garrison, and in many other\nplaces, as well belonging to themselves as to others attached to their\nparty.\n\nThe duke of Bourbon, on his arrival from this expedition at his town\nof Clermont, strengthened it, and all his other towns in that country,\nwith fortifications. When the garrisons had been properly posted,\nthe war suddenly broke out between the two parties of Armagnacs and\nBurgundians.\n\nThe duke of Burgundy had not been idle in fortifying his towns with\ngarrisons, and in collecting men at arms to resist his adversaries: he\nhimself was in Flanders making preparations to march an army to offer\nthem battle. The army of the Armagnacs had already made incursions into\nArtois, and had done much mischief to friend and foe, by carrying off\nprisoners and great plunder to the garrisons whence they had come. The\nBurgundians were not slow in making reprisals, and frequently invaded\nthe county of Clermont and other parts.\n\nWhen by chance the two parties met, the one shouted \u2018Orleans!\u2019 and\nthe other \u2018Burgundy!\u2019 and thus from this accursed war, carried on in\ndifferent parts, the country suffered great tribulation.\n\nThe duke of Burgundy, however, had the king on his side, and those also\nwho governed him: he resided in his h\u00f4tel of St Pol in Paris, and the\ngreater part of its inhabitants were likewise attached to the duke of\nBurgundy.\n\nAt that time, the governors of Paris were Waleran count de St Pol and\nJohn of Luxembourg[70], his nephew, who was very young, Enguerrand\nde Bournouville, and other captains. They frequently made sallies,\nwell accompanied by men at arms, on the Armagnacs, who at times even\nadvanced to the gates of Paris. They were particularly careful in\nguarding the person of the king, to prevent him from being seduced by\nthe Orleans-party, and carried out of the town.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XXXIII.\n\n    SIR CLUGNET DE BRABANT IS NEAR TAKING RETHEL.--HE OVERRUNS THE\n    COUNTRY OF BURGUNDY.--OTHER TRIBULATIONS ARE NOTICED.\n\n\nSir Clugnet de Brabant, who always styled himself admiral of France,\none day assembled two thousand combatants, or thereabout, whom he\nmarched as speedily as he could from their different garrisons, to the\ncountry of the Rethelois, having with them scaling ladders and other\nwarlike machines. They arrived at the ditches of the town of Rethel\nabout sun-rise, and instantly made a very sharp assault, thinking to\nsurprise the garrison and plunder the town. The inhabitants, however,\nhad received timely notice of their intentions, and had prepared\nthemselves for resistance as speedily as they could.--Nevertheless,\nthe assault lasted a considerable time with much vigour on both sides,\ninsomuch that many were killed and wounded of each party.\n\nAmong the latter was sir Clugnet de Brabant, who, judging from the\ndefence which was made, that he could not gain the place, ordered\nthe retreat to be sounded; and his men marched into the plain,\ncarrying with them the dead and wounded. He then divided them into two\ncompanies; the one of which marched through the country of the Laonnois\nto Coucy and Chauni, plundering what they could lay hands on, and\nmaking all prisoners whom they met on their retreat.\n\nThe other company marched through part of the empire, by the county of\nGuise, passing through the Cambresis, and driving before them, like\nthe others, all they could find, especially great numbers of cattle,\nand thus returned to the town of Ham sur Somme and to their different\ngarrisons.\n\nWhen they had reposed themselves for eight days, they again took the\nfield with six thousand combatants, and marched for the county of\nArtois. They came before the town of Bapaume, belonging to the duke of\nBurgundy, and, on their arrival, won the barriers, and advanced to the\ngates, where there was a severe skirmish. But the lord de Heilly, sir\nHugh de Busse, the lord d\u2019Ancuelles and other valiant men at arms, who\nhad been stationed there by the duke of Burgundy, made a sally, and\ndrove them beyond the barriers,--when many gallant deeds were done,\nand several killed and wounded on both sides; but the Burgundians were\nforced to retire within the town, for their enemies were too numerous\nfor them to attempt any effectual resistance. The Orleans-party now\nretreated, and collected much plunder in the adjacent country, which\nthey carried with them to their town of Ham.\n\nDuring this time, sir James de Chastillon[71], and the other\nambassadors from the king of France, negotiated a truce at Leulinghen,\nin the Boulonois, with the english ambassadors, to last for one year on\nsea and land.\n\nWhile these things were passing, the duke of Berry came with the queen\nof France from Melun to Corbeil, and thence sent Louis of Bavaria to\nthe duke of Acquitaine in Paris, and to those who governed the king,\nand also to the butchers, to request that they would be pleased to\nallow him to attend the queen to Paris, and to reside in his h\u00f4tel of\nNeele, near to the king his nephew, since he was determined no way to\ninterfere in the war between the dukes of Orleans and Burgundy.\n\nBut his request was refused, chiefly owing to the butchers of Paris,\nand others of the commonalty, who had great weight; and that he might\ngive over all thoughts of coming, they broke every door and window of\nhis h\u00f4tel de Neele, and committed other great damages. They sent back\nthe queen\u2019s brother with a message to her, to come and reside with her\nlord at Paris, without delay, but not to bring the duke of Berry with\nher.\n\nThe Parisians, fearful that the king and the duke of Acquitaine might\nbe carried off from the h\u00f4tel of St Pol, made them reside at the\nLouvre, where they kept constant guard day and night, to prevent any\nattempts of the Orleans-party to carry them away.\n\nThe queen, on receiving the message by her brother from the Parisians,\nand suspecting the consequences of their commotions, set out from\nCorbeil, and returned to Melun with him and the duke of Berry. A few\ndays after, the Parisians took up arms, marched in a large body to\nCorbeil, took the town, and placed a garrison therein. They then broke\ndown all the bridges over the Seine, between Charenton and Melun, that\nthe Armagnacs might not pass the river and enter the island of France.\n\nWhile the queen and the duke of Berry were at Melun, with the count\nWaleran de St Pol, whom the marshal Boucicaut had sent thither, the\nmaster of the cross-bows and the grand master of the household came to\nthem with few attendants. The duke of Bourbon and the count d\u2019Alen\u00e7on,\non their road from the Vermandois and Beauvoisis, to join the duke of\nOrleans, who was assembling his troops in the G\u00e2tinois, called on the\nqueen and the duke of Berry, to require their aid and support against\nthe duke of Burgundy, which was not granted,--because the king in\nfull council, presided by the duke of Acquitaine, had just published\nan edict in very strong terms, and had caused it to be sent to all the\nbailiwicks and seneschalships of the kingdom, ordering all nobles, and\nothers that were accustomed to bear arms, to make themselves ready to\nserve the king, in company with John duke of Burgundy, and to aid him\nin driving out of his realm all traitorous and disobedient subjects,\ncommanding them to obey the duke of Burgundy the same as himself,\nand ordering all towns and passes to be opened to him, and to supply\nhim with every necessary provision and store, the same as if he were\nthere in person. On this proclamation being issued, very many made\npreparations to serve under the duke of Burgundy with all diligence.\nIn addition, the duke of Acquitaine wrote the duke letters in his own\nhand, by which he ordered all the men at arms dependant on the crown to\nserve personally against his cousin-german, the duke of Orleans, and\nhis allies, who, as he said, were wasting the kingdom in many different\nparts, desiring him to advance as speedily as he could toward Senlis\nand the island of France.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XXXIV.\n\n    THE DUKE OF BURGUNDY ASSEMBLES A LARGE ARMY TO LAY SIEGE TO THE\n    TOWN OF HAM, AND LEADS THITHER HIS FLEMINGS.\n\n\nThe duke of Burgundy, being now assured that the duke of Orleans and\nhis allies were raising a large force to invade his countries, and that\nthey had already placed garrisons in towns and fortresses belonging\nto him or his allies, whence they had made frequent inroads to the\ndespoiling of his country, was highly discontented. To oppose them, he\nhad sent his summons to all his territories in Burgundy, Artois and\nFlanders, and elsewhere, for all nobles, and others accustomed to bear\narms in his behalf, to prepare themselves to join him with all speed,\nwell accoutred and armed, in obedience to the king\u2019s commands, and to\noppose his and the king\u2019s enemies.\n\nHe also solicited the assistance of his good towns in Flanders, and\nrequested that they would powerfully exert themselves in his favour,\nto which they readily and liberally assented. They raised a body of\nforty or fifty thousand combatants, well armed and provided with\nstaves according to the custom of the country. They had twelve thousand\ncarriages, as well carts as cars, to convey their armour, baggage and\nartillery, and a number of very large cross-bows, called ribaudequins,\nplaced on two wheels, each having a horse to draw it. They had also\nmachines for the attack of towns, behind which were long iron spits, to\nbe used toward the close of a battle,--and on each of them was mounted\none or two pieces of artillery.\n\nThe duke of Burgundy had also summoned to his assistance the duke of\nBrabant, his brother, who attended him with a handsome company; as\ndid likewise a valiant english knight, named sir William Baldock,\nlieutenant of Calais, with about three hundred english combatants.\n\nTheir places of rendezvous were at the towns of Douay and Arras, and\nthe adjacent country. The duke of Burgundy, on quitting Douay with his\nbrother of Brabant and great multitudes of men of rank, advanced to\nSluys, belonging to the count de la Marche, where he lodged. On the\nmorrow, the first day of September, he marched away early, and fixed\nhis quarters on the plain near to Marcouin, where he had his tents\nand pavilions pitched, and waited there two days for the arrival of\nhis whole army, and particularly for his Flemings, who came in grand\nparade, and drew up to their quarters in handsome array.--So numerous\nwere their tents that their encampments looked like large towns; and\nin truth, when all were assembled, they amounted to sixty thousand\nfighting men, without including the varlets, and such like, who were\nnumberless,--and the whole country resounded with the noises they made.\n\nWith regard to the Flemings, they thought that no towns or fortresses\ncould withstand them; and the duke of Burgundy was obliged, on their\nsetting off, to abandon to them whatever they might conquer; and when\nthey went from one quarter to another, they were commonly all fully\narmed, and in companies, according to the different towns and the\ncustom of Flanders,--and even when they marched on foot, the greater\npart wore leg-armour.\n\nAs to their mode of marching through a country, whatever they could\nlay hands on was seized, and, if portable, thrown into their carts;\nand they were so proud, on account of their great numbers, that they\npaid not any attention to noble men, however high their rank; and when\nthe army was to be quartered, or when they were on a foraging party,\nthey rudely drove away other men at arms, especially if they were not\ntheir countrymen, taking from them whatever provision they might have\ncollected, or any thing else that pleased them. This conduct created\ngreat disturbances and quarrels, more especially among the Picards, who\nwould not patiently endure their rudeness, insomuch that the duke of\nBurgundy and his captains had great difficulty in keeping any kind of\npeace between them.\n\nThe duke, after waiting some days for the whole of his army, saw it\narrive; and then he marched off triumphantly, and in handsome array,\nand fixed his quarters on the river Scheldt, near to the town of\nMarcouin.\n\nOn the morrow, he advanced to Mouchi la Garhe, between Peronne and Ham,\nand halted there. At this place, a Fleming was hanged for stealing a\nchalice and other valuables from a church. He thence marched toward the\ntown of Ham sur Somme, where his enemies were.\n\nOn his approach to the town of Athies, belonging to the count de\nDammartin, one of his adversaries, the inhabitants were so terrified\nthat they came out in a body to present him with the keys of the gates,\non the condition of being secured from pillage. The duke liberally\ngranted their request, seeing they had thus humbled themselves before\nhim of their own free will, and gave them a sufficient force to guard\ntheir town from being any way molested.----The duke then advanced with\nhis army near to Ham, but sent forward some of his best light troops\nto observe the countenance of the enemy. The Orleans-party sallied\nout against them, and a sharp skirmish took place; but they were\ncompelled, by the superior number of the Burgundians, to retire within\nthe town. The next day he marched his whole army before the place in\nbattle-array, and had his tents pitched on an eminence in front of one\nof the gates, and about the distance of a cannon shot. The Flemings\nwere likewise encamped according to the orders of their marshals\nand leaders, during which the garrison made some sallies, but were\nrepulsed, in spite of their valour, by superior numbers, and many were\nkilled and wounded on each side.\n\nWhen the duke had surrounded this town on one side only, he ordered\nbattering machines to be placed against the gate and wall, to demolish\nthem; and the Flemings pointed their ribaudequins, and shot from them\nso continually, day and night, that the enemy were greatly annoyed.\nBreaches were made in the wall and gate within a few days; but though\nthe garrison was much harrassed, they repaired both in the best manner\nthey could, with wood and dung.\n\nAt length, the besiegers fixed on a day for a general attack on the\ngate, intending to force an entry: the engagement continued very sharp\nfor three hours, but the garrison defended themselves so valiantly,\nwounding and slaying so many of the assailants, that they were forced\nto retreat. This happened on a Thursday; and on the Friday, the duke\nof Burgundy, I know not for what reason, had it proclaimed that no\none should, on any account, make an assault on the town, but that all\nshould labour in forming bridges over the Somme, that a passage might\nbe obtained for the army, and that the place might be besieged on all\nsides,--but events turned out very far from his expectations.\n\nOn the Friday morning, the besieged were expecting that the attack\nwould be renewed; but hearing of the duke\u2019s intentions to cross the\nriver with his army and surround the town, they packed up all their\nvaluables and fled, leaving within the walls only poor people and\npeasants, who had retired thither for safety. Those persons not having\nability or inclination to defend themselves, the duke\u2019s army, headed\nby the Picards, entered the place without any danger. The Flemings,\nobserving this, rushed so impetuously to gain admittance that many\nwere squeezed to death. When they had entered, they instantly began to\nplunder all they could lay hands on, according to the liberty which\ntheir lord the duke had granted them; for, as I have said, he had been\nnecessitated so to do before they would march from home. Part placed\nthemselves on one side of the street, leading to the gate which they\nhad entered, and part on the other; and when the Picards, or others\nnot of their country, were returning, they stopped and robbed them of\nall they had: they spared no man, noble or otherwise; and in this riot\nseveral were killed and wounded.\n\nThey entered a monastery of the town, and took away all they could\nfind, and carried to their tents many of both sexes, and children;\nand, on the morrow, having seized all they had, they set fire to\nseveral parts of the town,--and, to conclude all, the churches and\nhouses, with many of the inhabitants, were burnt, as well as a great\nquantity of cattle that had been driven thither as to a place of\nsecurity.\n\nNotwithstanding this cruel conduct of the Flemings, six or seven of the\nmonks escaped from the monastery, by the assistance of some noblemen,\nparticularly the prior, who most reverently held in his hands a cross,\nand were conducted to the tents of the duke of Burgundy, where they\nwere in safety.\n\nSuch was the conduct of the Flemings at the commencement of this war.\nThere were many towns beyond the Somme that belonged to the duke of\nOrleans and his allies, who, hearing of what had passed at Ham, were,\nas it may be readily believed, in the utmost fear and alarm; and there\nwere few people desirous of waiting their coming, lest they should be\nbesieged in some fortress, and suffer a similar fate,--for sir Clugnet\nde Brabant and sir Manessier Guieret, as I have said, had already\nabandoned Ham, which was well supplied with stores and provision, and\nhad retreated to Chauni and to Coucy.\n\nThe inhabitants of the town of Neelle, belonging to the count de\nDammartin, seeing the smoke of Ham, were greatly perplexed, for their\ngarrison had fled; but they, following the example of the town of\nAthies, waited on the duke of Burgundy, and, with many lamentations,\npresented him with the keys of their town, offering to submit\nthemselves to his mercy. The duke received them into favour, in the\nname of the king and his own, on their swearing not to admit any\ngarrison, and to be in future true and loyal subjects to the king,\ntheir sovereign lord.\n\nThis oath they willingly took; and, having thanked the duke for his\nmercy, they returned to their town, and by his orders demolished some\nof their gates and many parts of their walls. They also made their\nmagistrates and principal inhabitants swear to the observance of the\ntreaty which they had made, and for this time they remained in peace.\n\nIn like manner, those of the town of Roye, that were but lately become\nsubjects to the king, sent deputies to the duke, at his camp before\nHam, to say, that the Orleans party had treacherously entered their\ntown, and had done them much mischief, but that they had departed on\nhearing of his march, and requesting he would not be displeased with\nthem, as they were ready to receive him, and act according to his\npleasure. The duke told them, he should be satisfied if they would\npromise, on their oaths, never to admit again within their walls any of\nhis adversaries of the Orleans-party. Having obtained this answer, they\nreturned joyous to their town.\n\nThe duke now passed the Somme with his army at Ham, leaving that town\ncompletely ruined, and marched toward Chauni on the Oise, belonging to\nthe duke of Orleans; but the garrison, hearing of it, quitted the place\nin haste. The townsmen, greatly alarmed, sent, without delay, to offer\nhim their keys, and humbly supplicated his mercy, saying that their\nlord\u2019s men at arms had fled on hearing of his approach, from the fear\nthey had of him. The duke received them kindly, and took their oaths,\nthat they would henceforth loyally obey the king their sovereign lord,\nand himself, and would admit a garrison of his men to defend the town.\n\nAfter the conclusion of this treaty, the duke advanced to Roye, in the\nVermandois, and was lodged in the town, having quartered his army\nin the country round it. He dispatched thence sir Peter des Essars,\nknight, and his confidential adviser, to the king of France, to his\nson-in-law the duke of Acquitaine, and to the citizens of Paris, to\nmake them acquainted with the strength of his army, and with his\nsuccesses. Sir Peter des Essars was honourably received by the duke\nof Acquitaine and the Parisians; and in compliment to the duke of\nBurgundy, he was reinstated in his office of provost, in the room of\nsir Brunelet de Sainct Cler, who, by the royal authority, was appointed\nbailiff of Senlis, on the dismission of sir Gastelius du Bost, who was\nsuspected of being a favourer of the Orleans-party.\n\nWhen sir Peter des Essars had finished the business he had been sent\non to Paris, he set out for Rethel to announce to the count de Nevers,\nwho had assembled a considerable force, the march of the duke, and to\ndesire him to advance to the town of Mondidier, where he would have\nmore certain intelligence of his brother. The count de Nevers, on\nhearing this, used all diligence to assemble his men, and set off to\njoin the duke.\n\nDuring these transactions, the duke of Orleans, the count d\u2019Armagnac,\nthe constable of France, the master of the cross-bows, with a large\nbody of men at arms and others, came to the town of Melun, where the\nqueen of France and the duke of Berry resided. Having held a conference\nwith the queen and duke, they advanced to La Fert\u00e8 on the Marne, which\nbelonged to sir Robert de Bar[72], in right of his wife the viscountess\nde Meaux. They crossed the Marne, and came to Arsy en Mussien, in the\ncounty of Valois, dependant on the duke of Orleans, where his brother,\nthe count de Vertus, met him.\n\nThe count was accompanied by a numerous body of combatants, among whom\nwere the duke of Bourbon, John son to the duke of Bar, sir William de\nCoucy, Am\u00e9 de Sallebruche, sir Hugh de Hufalize, with others from the\nArdennes, Lorraine and Germany, who, in the whole, amounted to full six\nthousand knights and esquires, not including armed infantry and bowmen;\nand this party was henceforward popularly called _Armagnacs_, as I have\nbefore observed. Each bore on his armour badges similar to those which\nthey had formerly worn when they lay before Paris.\n\nThe duke of Orleans marched this army from the Valois, passing by\nSenlis, toward his county of Beaumont; but Enguerrand de Bournouville,\nwho had been posted in Senlis with a large force of men at arms to\nguard it, sallied out on their rear, and made a good booty of their\nbaggage as well as prisoners. In doing this, however, he lost some of\nhis men, who were slain or taken, and he then returned to Senlis. The\nduke of Orleans, with the other princes, were lodged in the castle of\nBeaumont, and his army in the country surrounding it.\n\nThe count de Nevers was prevented from joining his brothers as he\nintended,--for the Armagnacs, being the strongest, constrained him to\nconduct his army to Paris.\n\nThe duke of Burgundy was already arrived at Mondidier with his whole\narmy, and was making preparations to combat his enemies, should they\nbe so inclined, or to attack any town to which they should retire,\naccording to his pleasure. But the Flemings were now desirous to return\nhome, and had demanded permission of the duke, saying, that they had\nserved the time required of them on their departure from Flanders.\n\nThe duke was much surprised and displeased at their conduct, but\nearnestly desired that they would stay with him for only eight days\nlonger, as he had received intelligence that his enemies were near at\nhand, with a great army, ready to offer him battle, and that they could\nnever serve him more effectually. At this moment, the greater part of\ntheir officers waited on the duke to take leave of him, who, hearing\nthe earnest and affectionate manner in which he made so trifling a\nrequest, resolved to go back to their men and inform them of it, and\npromised to do every thing in their power in order that it should be\ncomplied with.\n\nOn their return to the tent of Ghent, where all their councils were\nheld, they assembled the leaders of the commonalty, and told them the\nrequest the duke their lord had made, namely, that they would stay with\nhim only eight days more, for that his adversaries were at hand with\na large army to offer him battle. This request having been stated,\nvarious were the opinions of the meeting: some were for staying, others\nnot, saying they had fulfilled the term required of them by their\nlord,--that winter was approaching, when, so numerous as they were,\nthey could not keep the field without great danger. Their opinions\nwere so discordant that no conclusion could be formed, to enable their\ncaptains to give any positive answer to the duke.\n\nThis council was held the 20th day of September, in the afternoon;\nand when it became dusk, these Flemings made very large fires in\ndifferent places, of the wood and timber of the houses which they\nhad pulled down and destroyed in Mondidier. They then began to load\ntheir baggage-waggons, and to arm themselves; and at midnight they all\nshouted from their quarters, in Flemish, _Vax, vax!_ which signifies,\n\u2018To arms, to arms!\u2019 and alarmed all the other parts of the army.\n\nThe duke of Burgundy was entirely ignorant of what they intended to do,\nand sent some flemish lords to know their intentions; but they would\nnot explain themselves to any one, and made answers contrary to the\nquestions asked. During this, the night passed away; and the moment day\nappeared, they harnessed their horses to the baggage-waggons, and set\nfire to all their lodgings, shouting, \u2018Gau, gau!\u2019 and departed, taking\nthe road to Flanders.\n\nThe attendants of the duke of Burgundy, hearing this cry and clamour,\nwent to inform him of it in his tent. Very much astonished thereat, he\ninstantly mounted his horse, and, accompanied by the duke of Brabant,\nrode after them. When he had overtaken them, with his head uncovered\nand his hands uplifted, he most humbly besought them to return,\nand stay with him four days only, calling them his most trusty and\nwell-beloved friends and companions, offering them great gifts, and\npromising to relieve the country of Flanders from taxes for ever, if\nthey would comply with his wishes.\n\nThe duke of Brabant also remonstrated with them on the advantages\noffered them by their lord, and, as he asked in return so very trifling\na favour, entreated them to pay due deference to his demand. But it was\nin vain: they turned a deaf ear to all that was said, and continued\ntheir march, only showing the written agreements they had made with\nthe duke, which were carried before them, and which they had fulfilled\non their part; but, as they were signed with his seal, he had not\nperformed his, in having them escorted beyond the river Somme to a\nplace of safety. Should he refuse to do this, they would send him his\nonly son, then at Ghent, cut into thousands of pieces.\n\nThe duke of Burgundy, noticing their rude manners, and perceiving that\nnothing was to be gained from them by fair means, began to appease them\nby ordering the trumpets to sound for decamping. This was not done\nwithout much loss,--for the duke, occupied solely with the attempt to\nmake the Flemings change their minds, had not ordered the tents to be\nstruck, nor the baggage loaded, so that the greater part of the tents\nwere burnt, with other things, from the fire of the houses caused\nby the Flemings on their departure. The flames spread from house to\nhouse, to the lodgings of the duke of Burgundy, who was troubled to the\nheart,--for he well knew that his adversaries were in high spirits, a\nshort day\u2019s march off, and he was anxious to give them battle; but from\nthis conduct of the Flemings his intentions would be frustrated,--and\nwhat was worse, he knew for certain, that the moment they should hear\nof it, they would publish that he had retreated, not daring to meet\nthem. He was, nevertheless, forced to submit to events which he could\nnot foresee nor prevent.\n\nThe Flemings had no sooner turned their faces homeward but they\nadvanced more in one day than in three before, and whatever they could\nlay hands on was pillaged and thrown into their baggage-carts: they\nhad, moreover, many quarrels with the Picards and English, and it often\nhappened that stragglers were wounded or put to death,--and when they\nwere superior in numbers, they failed not to retaliate.\n\nIt must be remembered, that this retreat took place in the month of\nSeptember, when the grapes in the vineyards were ripe; and they robbed\nevery vineyard they passed, devouring so many that numbers were found\ndead among the vines. On the other hand, they fed their horses and\ncattle so very abundantly on the immense pillage which they every where\nmade, that very many were bursten.\n\nThe duke of Burgundy, on his arrival at Peronne with his men at arms,\nwent personally to thank the Flemings, who were encamped on the river\nside, in the most humble manner for their services, and then had them\nescorted by his brother, the duke of Brabant, to Flanders, when every\nman returned to his home. The magistrates of the great towns were,\nhowever, very much displeased when they heard of their behaviour; but\nthey did not at the time notice it, for there were too many of them\nunder arms.\n\nThus did the Flemings retreat from Mondidier contrary to the will of\ntheir lord, the duke of Burgundy. On the same day, a knight of the\nparty of the duke of Orleans, called sir Peter de Quesnes, lord of\nGarois, at the head of full two hundred combatants, made an attack\non Mondidier, about four hours after they had marched away. He found\nthere many people, especially merchants, and inhabitants of the\nneighbourhood, whom he took prisoners: he slew many, and he and his men\nmade a very great booty.\n\nHe then returned to Clermont in Beauvoisis, whither the Armagnacs had\nmarched in pursuit of the count de Nevers. When they heard of this\nretreat of the duke of Burgundy and the Flemings, they held a council\nwhether or not they should follow them into their own country. It\nwas at length determined by the wisest to return toward Paris, and\nattempt to gain admittance by means of some connexions they had there,\nprincipally in order to have possession of the person of the king,\nwhich was their grand object.\n\nThey began their march, in consequence, towards Verberies, and crossed\nthe river Oise by a new bridge, which they erected, and thence advanced\nfor Paris. Those who had the guard of the king and the Parisians\nwere not well pleased to hear of their being so near, and made every\npreparation to oppose their entrance to Paris. The Armagnacs, finding\nit impossible to succeed, managed so well with the inhabitants of St\nDenis that they were there admitted; and the princes lodged in the\ntown, and the army in the adjacent fields and villages. From that\nsituation, they made a sharp war on the town of Paris, and on all those\nwho sided with the king and the duke of Burgundy.\n\nThey advanced daily from different parts to the very gates of\nParis,--when sallies were made against them, particularly by sir\nEnguerrand de Bournouville, who was one of the chiefs of the garrison\nunder the count Waleran de St Pol, the governor of the town. Severe\nskirmishes often took place, and many gallant deeds were done by the\nmen at arms of both sides.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XXXV.\n\n    THE DUKE OF BURGUNDY ASSEMBLES ANOTHER ARMY TO MARCH TO\n    PARIS.--EVENTS THAT HAPPENED DURING THAT TIME.\n\n\nWe will now return to the duke of Burgundy, who having, as I have said,\ndismissed his Flemings, under the escort of his brother the duke of\nBrabant, went from Peronne to Arras, where he met the earls of Pembroke\nand of Arundel, and sir William Baldock, who had accompanied him on his\nlate expedition. As these earls were lately come from England, he paid\nthem every respect, in compliment to the king of England who had sent\nthem. They had brought full twelve hundred combatants, as well horse as\nfoot, all men of courage.\n\nMuch intercourse took place at this time between the king of England\nand the duke of Burgundy, respecting a marriage between Henry prince of\nWales and one of the duke\u2019s daughters[73].--After he had magnificently\nfeasted these english captains in his town of Arras, and made them\nhandsome presents, he ordered them to march to Peronne, and hastily\nsummoned men at arms from all quarters to meet him personally at\nPeronne, where he had commanded the nobles of his estates to assemble.\n\nThe duke of Brabant did not meet him this time, being detained in the\ncounty of Luxembourg by affairs on behalf of his wife. The duke of\nBurgundy left Peronne with no more than six thousand combatants, and\nmarched to Roye,--thence, by Breteuil, to Beauvais, and from Beauvais,\nthrough Gisors, to Pontoise, where he halted for three weeks or\nthereabout. During this period, great numbers of men at arms came from\ndifferent countries to serve him.\n\nWhile these things were passing, it was ordered by the royal council,\nin the presence of the duke of Acquitaine, the count de Mortain,\nthe lord Gilles of Brittany, Waleran count de St Pol, governor of\nParis, the chancellor of France[74], the lord Charles de Savoisy,\nand other great nobles, that certain proclamations should be sent to\nall the bailiwicks and seneschalships of the kingdom, respecting the\nassembling of such large bodies of men at arms, daily done in defiance\nof the king\u2019s orders, by the duke of Orleans, his brothers, the duke\nof Bourbon, the counts d\u2019Alen\u00e7on and d\u2019Armagnac, and others of their\nparty, to the great mischief and tribulation of the kingdom at large,\nand highly displeasing to the king and disgraceful to his dignity.\n\nThis proclamation again prohibited any one from daring to join the\naforesaid nobles, or any of their party in arms, under pain of being\nreputed rebels and traitors to the king and his realm. It likewise\ncommanded all that had joined them to depart without delay, and return\npeaceably to their homes, without further living on or harrassing the\npeople, and ordered that no hindrance should be given to prevent this\nfrom being carried into effect. Such as should disobey these orders\nwould be most rigorously prosecuted without delay as rebels,--and from\nthat day forth no grace or favour would be shown them.\n\nThis proclamation was published in the usual places, and some few, but\nin no great number, privately quitted the party of the Armagnacs, and\nreturned to that of the king. Those that were disobedient, when taken\nby the royal officers, were in great danger of their lives. Several\nwere publicly executed; and among them a knight, called sir Binet\nd\u2019Espineuse, attached to the duke of Bourbon from being a native of\nthe county of Clermont, suffered at Paris. The cause of his death was\nhis having taken by force some flanders horses that were coming as a\npresent to the duke of Acquitaine from the duke of Burgundy. After he\nwas beheaded in the market-place, his body was suspended by the arms to\nthe gibbet at Montfaucon.\n\nThis punishment was inflicted by order of sir Peter des Essars, who, as\nhas been said, was lately re-established in his office of provost of\nParis, in the room of sir Brunelet de Sainct-Cler.\n\nThe duke of Orleans and his party were indignant at this execution, as\nwell as at the late royal proclamation; and the duke of Bourbon was\nparticularly angry at the disgraceful death of his knight.\n\nThus affairs went on from bad to worse. One day, the duke of Orleans\nfixed his quarters, with a large force, at the castle of St Ouen, which\nis a royal mansion, and thence made daily excursions to the gates of\nParis. He pressed the Parisians so hard that they were much straitened\nfor provisions; for they were not as yet accustomed to war, nor had\nthey provided any stores or assembled a force sufficient to repel the\nattacks of their adversaries.\n\nThe archbishop of Sens, brother to the late grand master Montagu, had\njoined the Armagnacs, but not in his pontifical robes; for instead\nof a mitre, he wore a helmet,--for a surplice, a coat of mail,--and\nfor a cope, a piece of steel,--for his croisier, a battle-axe. At this\nperiod, the duke of Orleans sent his heralds with letters to the king\nand the duke of Acquitaine, to inform them that the duke of Burgundy\nhad fled with his Flemings from Mondidier, not daring to wait his\nnearer approach. He took that opportunity of writing also to some\nof his friends in Paris, to know if through their means he could be\nadmitted into the town. It was lost labour, for those who governed for\nthe duke of Burgundy were too active and attentive in keeping the party\ntogether.\n\nBy some intrigues between those of the Orleans-party and one named\nColinet du Puiseur, who was governor for the king in the town of St\nCloud, this place was given up to them. The duke of Orleans instantly\nre-garrisoned it, and continually harrassed the Parisians; for now\nhe could at any time cross the Seine at the bridge of St Cloud, and\nattack both sides of Paris at once. Thus were the Parisians oppressed\non all sides by the Armagnacs,--on which account, another proclamation\nwas issued in the king\u2019s name throughout the realm, complaining of\nthe continued atrocious and rebellious acts, in spite of the positive\norders of the king to the contrary, committed by the duke of Orleans\nand his allies, to the great loss and destruction of his subjects\nand kingdom; that since such grievous complaints had been made on\nthe subject, and were continually made, he was resolved to have a\nstop put to such lawless proceedings. The king, therefore, with\nmature deliberation of council, now declares the aforesaid family of\nOrleans, and their allies, rebels, and traitors to himself and the\ncrown of France; and in order that henceforward no persons may dare\nto join them, he declares, all such to have forfeited their lives and\nestates, and by these presents gives power and authority to all his\nloyal subjects to arrest and imprison any of the aforesaid rebels, and\nto seize on their properties, moveable or immoveable, and to drive\nthem out of the kingdom, without let or hindrance from any of the\nking\u2019s officers. Given at Paris, the 3d day of October, 1411. Signed\nby the king, on the report from the great council specially called\nfor this purpose, at the h\u00f4tel de St Pol, when were present the duke\nof Acquitaine, the count de Mortain, the count de la Marche, Louis\nde Baviere, the lord Gilles of Brittany, the count de St Pol, the\nchancellor of France, with many other nobles of high rank.\n\nIn consequence of this proclamation, many of the captains and noblemen\nof the Armagnacs grew cold in their service, or delayed joining them\naccording to their former agreements; and fearing greater evils might\nbefal them by further incurring the indignation of the king, they\nwithdrew to the king\u2019s party, and excused themselves the best way they\ncould.\n\nWhile these affairs were going forward, the duke of Burgundy remained\nat Pontoise, as I have before said, and was there joined by numbers of\nmen at arms, as well vassals to the king as his own.\n\nDuring his stay at Pontoise, a man of a strong make entered his\napartment, with the intention to murder him, and had a knife hid in\nhis sleeve to accomplish his wicked purpose; but as he advanced to\nspeak with him, the duke, having no knowledge of his person, and always\nsuspicious of such attempts, placed a bench before him. Shortly after,\nsome of his attendants, perceiving his design, instantly arrested him,\nwhen, on confessing his intentions, he was beheaded in the town of\nPontoise.\n\nThe king, in order to strike more terror into the duke of Orleans\nand his allies, issued other proclamations throughout his kingdom.\nUnderneath is the tenour of the one which he sent to the bailiff of\nAmiens.\n\n\u2018Charles, by the grace of God, king of France, to the bailiff of\nAmiens, or to his lieutenant, sends health.\n\n\u2018It has lately come to our knowledge, by informations laid before\nour council, that John, our uncle of Berry, Charles our nephew, duke\nof Orleans, and his brothers, with John de Bourbon, John d\u2019Alen\u00e7on,\nCharles d\u2019Albreth, our cousin Bernard d\u2019Armagnac, in conjunction with\nothers, their aiders and abettors, moved by the wicked and damnable\ninstigations of their own minds, have for a long time plotted to depose\nand deprive us of our royal authority, and with their utmost power to\ndestroy our whole family, which God forbid! and to place another king\non the throne of France, which is most abominable to the hearing of\nevery heart in the breasts of our loyal subjects.\n\n\u2018We, therefore, by the mature deliberation of our council, do most\nsolemnly, in this public manner, divulge these abominable and\ntraitorous intentions of the aforesaid persons, and earnestly do call\nfor the assistance of all our loyal subjects, as well those bound to\nserve us by the tenure of their fiefs as the inhabitants of all our\ntowns, who have been accustomed to bear arms, to guard and defend our\nrights and lives against the traitors aforesaid, who have now too\nnearly approached our person, inasmuch as they have entered by force\nour town of St Denis, which contains not only many holy relics of the\nsaints but the sacred bodies of saints, our crown and royal standard,\nknown by the name of the Oriflamme, with several other precious and\nrare jewels.\n\n\u2018They have also gained forcible possession of the bridge of St Cloud,\nand have invaded our rights, (not to say any thing of our very dear\nand well-beloved cousin, the duke of Burgundy, to whom they have sent\nletters of defiance,) by setting fire to and despoiling our towns and\nvillages, robbing churches, ransoming or killing our people, forcing\nmarried women, and ravishing maidens, and committing every mischief\nwhich the bitterest enemy could do. We therefore do enjoin and command\nthee, under pain of incurring our heaviest displeasure, that thou\ninstantly cause this present ordinance to be proclaimed in the usual\nplaces in the town of Amiens, and in different parts within thy said\nbailiwick, so that no one may plead ignorance; and that thou do punish\ncorporally, and by confiscation of property, the aforesaid persons,\ntheir allies and confederates, whom thou mayest lay hands on, as guilty\nof the highest treason against our person and crown, that by so doing\nan example may be held forth to all others. We also command, under\nthe penalty aforesaid, all our vassals, and all those in general who\nare accustomed to carry arms, to repair to us as soon as possible. Be\ncareful to have the within ordinances strictly executed, so that we may\nnot have cause to be displeased with thee.\n\n\u2018Given at Paris, the 14th day of October, 1411, and in the 32d year of\nour reign.\u2019\n\nThis ordinance was signed by the king, on the report of his council,\nand thus dispatched to Amiens and other good towns, where it was\nproclaimed in the usual places, and with such effect on the vassals and\nloyal subjects of the king that they hastened in prodigious numbers to\nserve him.\n\nOn the other hand, very many of those who were of the Orleans-party\nwere arrested in divers parts of the realm,--some of whom were\nexecuted, and others confined in prison, or ransomed, as if they had\nbeen public enemies. It was pitiful to hear the many and grievous\ncomplaints which were made by the people of their sufferings, more\nespecially by those in the neighbourhood of Paris and in the isle of\nFrance.\n\nI must not forget, among other circumstances, to relate, that the\nParisians, to the amount of three thousand, as well those of the\ngarrison as others, sallied out of Paris, and went to the palace of\nWinchester (Bic\u00eatre), a very handsome mansion of the duke of Berry,\nwhere, from hatred to the duke, they destroyed and plundered the whole,\nleaving the walls only standing.--When they had done this, they went\nand destroyed another house, where the duke kept his horses, situated\non the river Seine, not far from the h\u00f4tel de Neelle.\n\nThe duke was much enraged when he was told of the insult and mischief\nthat had been done to him, and said aloud, that a time would come when\nthese Parisians should pay dearly for it.\n\nAffairs daily grew worse; and at length, the duke of Berry, the duke of\nOrleans and his brothers, the duke of Bourbon, the counts d\u2019Alen\u00e7on and\nd\u2019Armagnac, the lord d\u2019Albreth, were personally banished the realm by\nthe king, with all their adherents, of whatever rank they might be, by\nsound of trumpet in all the squares of Paris, and forbidden to remain\nor set foot within it until they should be recalled.\n\nThey were not only banished the kingdom of France, but, by virtue of\na bull of pope Urban V. of happy memory, (preserved in the Tr\u00e9sor des\nChartres of the king\u2019s privileges in the holy chapel at Paris), they\nwere publicly excommunicated and anathematised in all the churches of\nthe city of Paris, by bell, book, and candle. Many of their party were\nmuch troubled at these sentences, but, nevertheless, continued the same\nconduct, and made a more bitter war than before.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XXXVI.\n\n    THE DUKE OF BURGUNDY MARCHES A LARGE ARMY FROM PONTOISE TO\n    PARIS, THROUGH MELUN.--THE SITUATION AND CONDUCT OF THE DUKE OF\n    ORLEANS.\n\n\nI have mentioned, that during the stay of the duke of Burgundy at\nPontoise, he received great reinforcements of men at arms from all\nparts: among others, the count de Penthievre, his son-in-law, joined\nhim with a noble company. Having remained there for about fifteen days,\nand made diligent inquiry into the state of his adversaries, on the 22d\nday of October, he marched his whole army thence about two o\u2019clock in\nthe afternoon. As the royal road from that place to Paris was occupied\nby the enemy, he quitted it for that through Melun sur Seine, where\nhe crossed the river with full fifteen thousand horse, and, marching\nall night, arrived on the morrow morning at the gate of St Jacques at\nParis. Great multitudes went out of the town to meet him; among whom\nwere the butchers of Paris, well armed and arrayed, conducted by the\nprovosts of the Ch\u00e2telet and of the merchants, under the command of the\ncount de Nevers, brother to the duke of Burgundy, who was attended by\nseveral princes, noble lords and captains: even the great council of\nstate went out upwards of a league to meet him, and to do him honour.\nIndeed, they all showed him as much deference and respect as they could\nhave done to the king of France, on his return from a long journey.\n\nWith regard to the people of Paris, they made great rejoicings on his\narrival, and sang carols in all the streets through which he passed;\nand because his entry was made late in the day, and it was dusk, the\nstreets were illuminated with great quantities of torches, bonfires and\nlanthorns.\n\nOn his approach to the Louvre, the duke of Acquitaine, who had married\nhis daughter, advanced to meet him, and received him with joy and\nrespect. He led him into the Louvre, and presented him to the king and\nqueen, who received him most graciously.\n\nHaving paid his due respects, he withdrew, and went to lodge at\nthe h\u00f4tel de Bourbon. The earl of Arundel was quartered, with his\nattendants, at the priory of St Martin des Champs, and his Englishmen\nnear to him in the adjoining houses. The rest quartered themselves as\nwell as they could in the city.\n\nOn the morrow, which was a Sunday, Enguerrand de Bournouville, with\nmany valiant men at arms and archers, as well Picards as English, made\na sally as far as La Chapelle, which the Armagnacs had fortified, and\nquartered themselves within it. On seeing their adversaries advancing,\nthey mounted their horses, and a sharp skirmish ensued, in which\nmany were unhorsed. Among those who behaved well, sir Enguerrand was\npre-eminent. Near his side was John of Luxembourg, nephew to the count\nde St Pol, but very young. Many were wounded, but few killed. The\nEnglish, with their bows and arrows, were very active in this affair.\n\nWhile this action was fought, the Armagnacs quartered at St Denis,\nMontmartre, and other villages, hearing the bustle, mounted their\nhorses, and hastened to cut off the retreat of Enguerrand. He was\ninformed of this in time, and, collecting his men, retreated toward\nParis; but as the enemy were superior in numbers, they pressed hard on\nhis rear, and killed and made prisoners several of his men.\n\nThe duke of Orleans and the princes of his party, on hearing of the\narrival of the duke of Burgundy with so large an army in Paris, ordered\ntheir men at arms, and others that were lodged in the villages round,\nto unite and quarter themselves at St Denis. To provide forage, sir\nClugnet de Brabant was sent with a body of men at arms into the Valois\nand Soissonois, where there was abundance. Sir Clugnet acquitted\nhimself well of his command, and brought a sufficient quantity to\nSt Denis; for at this time there was great plenty of corn and other\nprovision in France.\n\nThe Armagnacs were, therefore, well supplied; and as they were the\nstrongest on that side of Paris, they daily made excursions of\ndifferent parties as far as the rivers Marne and Oise, and throughout\nthe isle of France. In like manner, the army of the king and the duke\nof Burgundy scoured the country on the other side of the Seine, as far\nas Montlehery, Meulan and Corbeil; and thus was the noble kingdom of\nFrance torn to pieces.\n\nThere were frequent and severe rencounters between the men at arms of\neach side; and a continued skirmish was going forward between those in\nParis and in St Denis, when the honour of the day was alternately won.\n\nAmong other places where these skirmishes took place was a mill,\nsituated on an eminence, and of some strength. In this mill, two or\nthree hundred of the Orleans-party sometimes posted themselves, when\nthe Parisians and Burgundians made an attack on them, which lasted even\nuntil night forced them to retreat.--At other times, the Burgundians\nposted themselves in the mill, to wait for the assault of their\nadversaries.\n\nThe duke of Orleans had with him an english knight, called the lord de\nClifford, who had, some time before, joined him with one hundred men\nat arms and two hundred archers, from the country of the Bourdelois.\nHaving heard that the king of England had sent the earl of Arundel,\nwith several other lords, to the duke of Burgundy, he waited on the\nduke of Orleans to request that he would permit him to depart, for that\nhe was afraid his sovereign would be displeased with him should he\nremain any longer. The duke of Orleans having for a while considered\nhis request granted it, but on condition that neither he himself nor\nhis men should bear arms against him during the war. The knight made\nhim this promise, and then returned to England.\n\nOn the 6th day of November, Troullart de Moncaurel, governor and\nbailiff of Senlis, having marched about six score combatants of his\ngarrison to the country of Valois, was met by seven score of the\nArmagnacs, who vigorously attacked him; but, after many gallant deeds\nwere done, Troullart remained victorious. From sixty to eighty of the\nArmagnacs were taken or slain; and among the prisoners was sir William\nde Saveuse, who had followed the Orleans-party, when his two brothers,\nHector and Philip, were in arms with the duke of Burgundy. Thus, in\nthis abominable warfare, were brothers engaged against brothers, and\nsons against fathers. After this defeat, Troullart de Moncaurel and\nPeter Quieriet, who had accompanied him, returned with their booty\nto Senlis, when, shortly after, by the exertions of the old lord de\nSaveuse and the two brothers, Hector and Philip, sir William obtained\nhis liberty.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XXXVII.\n\n    THE DUKE OF BURGUNDY LEADS A GREAT FORCE, WITH THE PARISIANS,\n    TO ST CLOUD, AGAINST THE ARMAGNACS.\n\n\nThe duke of Burgundy having remained some time at Paris with his army,\nand having held many councils with the princes and captains who were\nthere, marched out of the town about midnight, on the 9th of November,\nby the gate of St Jacques. He was magnificently accompanied by men at\narms and Parisians, among whom were the counts de Nevers, de la Marche,\nde Vaudemont, de Penthievre, de St Pol, the earl of Arundel, Boucicaut\nmarshal of France, the lord de Vergy marshal of Burgundy, the lord de\nHeilly, lately appointed marshal of Acquitaine, the lord de St George,\nsir John de Croy, Enguerrand de Bournouville, the lord de Fosseux, sir\nRegnier Pot governor of Dauphiny, the seneschal of Hainault sir John de\nGuistelle, the lord de Brimeu, the earl of Kent, an Englishman, with\nmany other nobles, as well from Burgundy as from Picardy and different\ncountries. They were estimated by good judges at six thousand\ncombatants, all accustomed to war, and four thousand infantry from the\ntown of Paris.\n\nWhen they had passed the suburbs, they advanced in good array, under\nthe direction of trusty guides, to within half a league of Saint Cloud,\nwhere the Armagnacs were quartered. It might be about eight o\u2019clock in\nthe morning when they came thither, and the weather was very cold and\nfrosty. Being thus arrived without the enemy knowing of it, the duke of\nBurgundy sent the marshal of Burgundy, sir Gaultier des Ruppes, sir Guy\nde la Trimouille, and le veau de Bar, with eight hundred men at arms,\nand four hundred archers, across the Seine, toward St Denis, to prevent\nthe enemy from there crossing the river by a new bridge which they had\nerected over it. These lords so well executed the above orders that\nthey broke down part of the bridge, and defended the passage.\n\nThe duke, in the mean time, ascended the hill of St Cloud in order of\nbattle, and at the spot where four roads met posted the seneschal of\nHainault, sir John de Guistelle, the lord de Brimeu, John Phillips and\nJohn Potter[75], english captains, at one of them, with about four\nhundred knights and esquires, and as many archers. At another road, he\nstationed the lords de Heilly and de Ront, Enguerrand de Bournouville,\nand Aym\u00e9 de Vitry, with as many men as the knights above-mentioned. The\nthird road was guarded by Neville earl of Kent[76], with some picard\ncaptains; and the Parisians and others, to a great amount, were ordered\nto Sevres, to defend that road.\n\nWhen these four divisions had arrived at their posts, they made\ntogether a general assault on the town of St Cloud, which the Armagnacs\nhad fortified with ditches and barriers to the utmost of their power.\nAt these barriers, a notable defence was made by those who had heard of\nthe arrival of the enemy, under the command of their captains, namely,\nsir James de Plachiel, governor of Angoul\u00eame, the lord de Cambour,\nWilliam Batillier, sir Mansart du Bos, the bastard Jacob, knight, and\nthree other knights from Gascony, who fought bravely for some time; but\nthe superiority of numbers, who attacked them vigorously on all sides,\nforced them to retreat from their outworks, when they were pursued,\nfighting, however, as they retreated, to the tower of the bridge and\nthe church, which had been fortified.\n\nThe whole of the burgundian force which had been ordered on this duty,\nexcepting the party who guarded the passage of the bridge, now bent all\ntheir efforts against the church. The attack was there renewed with\ngreater vigour than before, and, notwithstanding the gallant defence\nthat was made, the church was stormed, and many were slain in the\nchurch as well as at the barriers. Numbers also were drowned of the\ncrowd that was pressing to re-enter the tower of the bridge, by the\ndrawbridge breaking under their weight.\n\nIt was judged by those well acquainted with the loss of the Armagnacs,\nthat including the drowned, there were nine hundred killed and five\nhundred prisoners. Among these last were sir Mansart du Bos, the lord\nde Cambour, and William Batillier. In the town of St Cloud were found\nfrom twelve to sixteen hundred horses that had been gained by plunder,\nand a variety of other things.\n\nWhile this was passing, the duke of Burgundy was with the main army\ndrawn up in battle-array, on a plain above the town: he had with him\nthe greater part of the princes, and his spies were every where on the\nlook-out that the enemy might not surprise him by any unexpected attack.\n\nThe engagement at the tower of the bridge was still continued by the\nBurgundians, in the hope of taking it; but it was labour in vain, for\nthose within defended it manfully.\n\nSome of the garrison sallied out on the opposite side, and hastened\nto St Denis, to inform the duke of Orleans of the disaster that had\nbefallen them. He was sorely displeased thereat, and instantly mounted\nhis horse, accompanied by the duke of Bourbon, the counts d\u2019Alen\u00e7on\nand d\u2019Armagnac, the constable, the master of the cross-bows, the young\nBoucicaut, and about two thousand combatants, advanced toward St Cloud,\nand drew up in battle-array on the side of the river Seine, opposite to\nwhere the duke of Burgundy was posted, and made every preparation as\nif for an immediate combat. The duke of Burgundy and his men likewise\ndismounted, drew up in order of battle, and displayed his banner, which\nwas most rich and splendid. But notwithstanding the eager desire which\nthese princes showed for the combat, it was to no purpose,--for the\nriver was between them, so that no damage could accrue to either party,\nexcepting by some chance bolts from the cross-bows, who shot at random.\n\nWhen the Armagnacs had remained there for some time, seeing that\nnothing effectual could be done, they remounted their horses and\nreturned to St Denis, leaving, however, a reinforcement to defend the\ntower of St Cloud. On their departure, the duke of Burgundy held a\ncouncil, and it was determined to march the whole army back to Paris.\nThe duke lost this day, in slain, not more than from sixteen to twenty;\nbut there were many wounded, among whom were Enguerrand de Bournouville\nand Aym\u00e9 de Vitry, who had fought well, as did the lord of Heilly. In\nlike manner, the earl of Arundel and his men behaved gallantly; and it\nwas one of them who had made sir Mansart du Bos prisoner, but for a sum\nof money he resigned him to one of the king\u2019s officers.\n\nThe duke of Burgundy, on his return, was received by the Parisians with\ngreat acclamations; for they had heard of his brilliant success, and\nthey imagined that through his means they should shortly be delivered\nfrom their enemies, who oppressed them sorely. With regard to the king,\nthe duke of Acquitaine, and the members of the grand council, prelates\nas well as seculars, the reception which they gave him, the princes and\nthe captains of his army, is not to be described.\n\nThe duke of Orleans, learning that the duke of Burgundy had returned\nto Paris with his army, held a council with the heads of his party,\nwhen, having considered the severe loss they had suffered of the most\nexpert of their captains, and the great power and numbers of their\nopponents, whom they could not at this moment withstand with hopes of\nsuccess, they resolved to retire to their own countries, and collect a\nsufficient army to oppose any force the king and the duke of Burgundy\nshould bring against them. This was no sooner determined than executed;\nfor they instantly packed up their baggage, and, crossing the\nnewly-erected bridge over the Seine, which they had repaired, and the\nbridge of St Cloud, hastily marched all night toward Estampes, and then\ncontinued their route to Orleans, and to other towns and castles under\ntheir obedience.\n\nThus, therefore, the duke of Orleans, in seeking vengeance for the\ndeath of his father, gained only disgrace and great loss of men. Such\nof them as were slain in the field, at the battle of St Cloud, were\nthere inhumanly left without sepulture, as being excommunicated, a prey\nto dogs, birds, and wild beasts. Some lords of his party, such as sir\nClugnet de Brabant, sir Aym\u00e9 de Sarrebruche, the lord de Hufalize, and\nmany more, passed through the county of Valois to Champagne, and thence\nto their own homes.\n\nNews of this retreat was, very early on the morrow, carried to the\nduke of Burgundy and his captains at Paris. Some of them mounted their\nhorses, and went to St Denis, when all that the Armagnacs had left was\nseized on and pillaged: they even arrested and carried away, in the\nking\u2019s name, the abbot of St Denis, for having admitted his enemies\ninto that town. Many of the principal inhabitants were also fined,\nnotwithstanding the excuses they offered. Others of the duke\u2019s officers\nwent to the town of St Cloud, which they found abandoned.--Many pursued\nthe Armagnacs, but in vain; for they had marched all night, and were at\na considerable distance before the news of their decampment had reached\nParis.\n\nA few days after, the king, by the advice and entreaties of the duke\nof Burgundy, bought the greater part of the prisoners made at the late\nbattle, by paying their ransoms to those who had taken them. In the\nnumber was Colinet, thus surnamed by many, who had betrayed the bridge\nof St Cloud to the duke of Orleans; and on the 12th day of November, he\nand five of his accomplices were beheaded in the market-place at Paris:\nhis body was quartered, and the five others were hung up by the arms on\nthe gibbet at Montfaucon.\n\nOn the 13th of the same month, a sermon was preached in the\nchurch-square, before the porch of N\u00f4tre Dame in Paris, by a Friar\nMinor, in the presence of the duke of Burgundy, many princes, and a\ngreat concourse of people,--in which he said that the bulls given by\npope Urban V. had been of the utmost efficacy against the rebellious\nsubjects of the king, and publicly denounced the duke of Orleans and\nhis party as excommunicated. They were also thus denounced in many\nother succeeding sermons.\n\nThe ensuing day, the king heard mass in N\u00f4tre Dame, and returned to the\nLouvre to dinner, when he most graciously received the earl of Arundel,\nand caused him to be seated at his table next to the duke of Burgundy.\n\nMany councils were held at Paris respecting this war, and on the\nmeasures the king should now adopt. It was at length determined, that\non account of the winter, neither the king nor the princes should\nattempt any thing more until the ensuing summer, but only have some\nable captains with a sufficient force on the frontiers, to harrass\nand pursue the enemy, and keep him in check. In consequence, the lord\nBoucicaut marshal of France, the lord de Heilly marshal of Acquitaine,\nEnguerrand de Bournouville, Aym\u00e9 de Vitry, the lord de Miraumont and\nothers, were ordered on this service with a very considerable force.\nThey marched toward Estampes and Bonneval, and those parts, having with\nthem the lord de Ront.\n\nBonneval, on the first summons from the above captains, surrendered to\nthe king\u2019s obedience, and the greater part of them were lodged in the\ntown, and in an adjoining abbey of some strength. Those of Estampes\nrefused to surrender, for it was garrisoned by the duke of Berry, and\nbegan to make war on the troops of the king and the duke of Burgundy,\nby the instigation of the lord Louis de Bourbon, governor of Dourdan,\nwho resided there.\n\nAt this period, with the consent of the duke of Burgundy, sir John de\nCroy, eldest son to the lord de Croy, still detained prisoner by the\nduke of Orleans, marched from Paris, with eight hundred combatants, for\nthe castle of Monchas, in the county of Eu, in which were the duke of\nBourbon\u2019s children and his lady-duchess, namely, one son about three\nyears old, and a daughter by her first husband nine years old, with\ntheir nurses and other attendants. The son of sir Mansart du Bos, and\nthe lord de Foulleuses, knight, were also there. The castle and the\nwhole of its inhabitants were taken by sir John de Croy; and he carried\nthem, and all he found within it, to the castle of Renty, where he held\nthem prisoners, until his father, the lord de Croy, was released. When\nthis misfortune was told to the duke of Bourbon, he was much afflicted;\nbut the duchess took it so sensibly to heart that very soon after she\ndied of grief[77].\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XXXVIII.\n\n    THE KING OF FRANCE SENDS THE COUNT DE SAINT POL TO THE VALOIS,\n    AND TO COUCY, AND OTHER CAPTAINS TO DIFFERENT PARTS AGAINST THE\n    ARMAGNACS.\n\n\nConformable to the resolutions of the aforesaid council, count Waleran\nde St Pol was sent into the Valois, to reduce the whole of that country\nto the king\u2019s obedience, and then to march to Coucy with a large body\nof men at arms, archers, and cross-bows.\n\nSir Philip de Servolles, bailiff of Vitry en Pertois, was also ordered\ninto the country of Vertus, with a considerable force, to subdue the\nwhole of it. The vidame of Amiens was sent into the county of Clermont.\nFerry d\u2019Hangest, bailiff of Amiens, was ordered, for the above purpose,\ninto the counties of Boulogne, Eu, and Gamaches.\n\nThe inhabitants of Crespy, the principal town of the Valois, no sooner\nlearnt the intentions of the count de St Pol than they surrendered it\nto him, and received him handsomely. He thence advanced to the castle\nof Pierrefons, which was very strong, and well provided with all\nwarlike stores and provision. On coming before it, he held a parley\nwith the lord de Boquiaux the governor, who concluded a treaty with\nhim for its surrender, on condition that the count would pay him, in\nthe king\u2019s name, two thousand golden crowns for his expenses, and that\nthe garrison should carry away all they had with them. The lady of\nGaucourt, who was in the castle, retired to the castle of Coucy, where\nshe was honourably received by sir Robert d\u2019Esne, the governor.\n\nThe count de St Pol marched from Pierrefons to la Fert\u00e9-Milon, a very\nstrong castle, and to Villers-Cotter\u00eats, both belonging to the duke of\nOrleans; when not only these two but all the other places in Valois,\nhearing of the surrender of so strong a castle as Pierrefons without\nmaking any resistance, surrendered, and returned to their obedience to\nthe king. The Count placed good garrisons in each, and then marched\nfor Coucy, in the Soissonois, where, as I have before said, sir\nRobert d\u2019Esne was governor of the castle. He had with him Rigault des\nFontaines, and others attached to the party of the duke of Orleans.\nThe governor of the town of Coucy was sir Enguerrand des Fontaines,\nand within it were many noblemen, who, holding a council, resolved to\nsurrender the place, and to leave it with all their baggage.\n\nThe count quartered himself and his men at arms in the town and\nsuburbs, and then summoned sir Robert d\u2019Esne, in the king\u2019s name, to\nsurrender the castle. This sir Robert refused to do, saying, that the\nduke of Orleans had given him orders, when he appointed him governor,\nnever to surrender it without his consent or knowledge, and these\norders he had sworn to obey; that it was well provided with all kinds\nof stores, and plenty of provision, so that he did not fear its being\ntaken by force; and he hoped, that before he should be induced to\nyield it, means would be found to restore his lord and master to the\ngood graces of the king.----The count, on hearing this answer, ordered\nthe castle to be surrounded, and quartered his men as near to it as\npossible, keeping up at the same time a brisk cannonade. Among other\nexpedients, the count employed a body of miners, to undermine the gate\nof the lower court, called la Porte Maistre Odon, which was as handsome\nan edifice as could be seen for twenty leagues round; and he employed\ncompanies of miners to work at the other large towers, who were so\nsuccessful that, in a short time, the mines were ready to be set fire\nto.\n\nThe governor was again summoned to surrender, but again refused. Upon\nwhich, the count ordered his men under arms, to be prepared for the\nstorm should it be necessary; and when all was ready, fire was set to\nthe combustibles within the mines, so that when the supporters were\nburnt, the whole of the tower and gate fell flat down, but, fortunately\nfor the besieged, the inside wall remained entire, so that the\nbesiegers were not greatly benefited. Several were killed and wounded\non both sides by the fall of the towers: one of them at the corner was\nprevented from falling to the ground by the wall supporting it; and one\nof the men at arms remained on this inclined tower, where he had been\nposted to guard it, and was in great peril of his life, but was saved\nby the exertions of the garrison.\n\nAt length, when the count de St Pol had been before this castle of\nCoucy about three months, a treaty was entered into between him and sir\nRobert, that he would surrender the castle on condition that he and his\ngarrison should depart unmolested whither they pleased, with all they\ncould carry with them, and should receive, for their expenses, twelve\nhundred crowns, or thereabout. When this was concluded, the governor\nmarched off with about fifty combatants, the principal of whom were\nhis son, le Baudrain de Fur, knight, Rigault des Fontaines, before\nmentioned, and Gaucher de Baissu. The lady de Gaucourt departed also\nin their company. Sir Robert and the greater part of his men went and\nfixed their residence at Creve-coeur and in the castle of Cambresis.\n\nThe count de St Pol, on the surrender of the castle, appointed sir\nGerard de Herbannes governor, with a sufficient garrison. There were\nwith him on this expedition his nephew John of Luxembourg, the vidame\nof Amiens, the lord de Houcourt, and many other nobles and esquires\nfrom Picardy, especially such as were his vassals. Having finished\nthis business so successfully, he returned to the king at Paris, who,\nin consideration of his good qualities, and as a remuneration for his\nservices, nominated him constable of France. The sword of office was\ndelivered to him, and he took the usual oaths, in the room of the lord\nd\u2019Albreth, who had been dismissed therefrom, being judged unworthy to\nhold it any longer.\n\nIn like manner, the lord de Rambures was appointed master of the\ncross-bows of France, in the place of the lord de Hangest, who had been\ndismissed by the king. The lord de Longny, a native of Brittany, was\nmade marshal of France, on the resignation, and with the consent, of\nthe lord de Rieux[78], who was superannuated.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XXXIX.\n\n    SIR PHILIP DE SERVOLLES, BAILIFF OF VITRY, LAYS SIEGE TO THE\n    CASTLE OF MOYENNES.----OTHER PLACES ARE BY THE KING\u2019S OFFICERS\n    REDUCED TO HIS OBEDIENCE.\n\n\nIn regard to the county of Vertus, the moment sir Philip de Servolles\ncame before the town of that name, it surrendered to the king,--and in\nlike manner all the other places in that county, excepting the castle\nof Moyennes. In this castle were sir Clugnet de Brabant, his brother\nJohn of Brabant, sir Thomas de Lorsies, and many more, who would not on\nany account submit to the king.\n\nThe bailiff of Vitry consequently laid siege to it, and made every\npreparation to conquer it by force. It was, however, in vain; for the\ngarrison were well provided with provision, artillery and stores of all\nkinds, so that they little feared the besiegers, and very frequently\ncut off their detachments.\n\nThe siege lasted for upwards of three months; and at the end of this\ntime, sir Clugnet and sir Thomas de Lorsies, mounted on strong and\nactive coursers, followed by two pages, set out from the castle,--and,\ngalloping through the besieging army with their lances in their rests,\npassed safely, striking down all opposers, escaped to Luxembourg, and\nwent to sir Aym\u00e9 de Sarrebruche to seek for succour. But they did not\nreturn with any assistance; for a few days after, John of Brabant was\nmade prisoner in a sally from the castle, and, by order of the king and\ncouncil, beheaded in the town of Vitry. After this event, the remainder\nof the garrison surrendered themselves to the king\u2019s obedience, on\nstipulating with the bailiff that they were to have their lives and\nfortunes spared. He instantly new-garrisoned the castle.\n\nThus was that whole country reduced to the king\u2019s obedience; and that\nof Clermont followed the example, by surrendering to the vidame of\nAmiens without making any resistance. The garrisons in the different\ntowns and castles that had done great mischief to the surrounding\ncountry withdrew with all their baggage, under the protection of\npassports, to the Bourbonois, and were replaced by the king\u2019s troops.\n\nThe bailiff of Amiens was equally successful at Boulogne-sur-mer,\nwhich, with all the adjacent places, surrendered, excepting the castle\nof Boulogne,--the seneschal of which, by name sir Louis de Corail,\na native of Auvergne, would not yield it without the permission of\nhis lord, the duke of Berry, who had intrusted it to his guard. The\nbailiff, however, with his men, destroyed the drawbridge, and filled\nup the ditches, so that no one could enter or come out of the castle.\nA parley took place between the governor and bailiff, when the first\nwas allowed to send to his lord, the duke of Berry, to know if he would\nconsent that the castle should be given up to the king, and hold him\ndischarged for so doing.\n\nThe duke, in answer, bade him surrender the castle to the king\u2019s\nofficers, and come to him at Bourges, which was done. In like manner,\nall the places in the county of Eu, and in the territory of Gamaches,\nwere surrendered to the king; and the officers who had been placed in\nthem by their lords were dismissed, and others of the king\u2019s servants\nput in their room.\n\nDuring this time, very large sums of money were raised in Paris and\nelsewhere, to pay the english troops who had come to serve the duke\nof Burgundy by permission of the king of England. On receiving their\npayment, the earl of Arundel, with his men, returned to England by\nway of Calais; but the earl of Kent[79] and his troops remained in the\nservice of the duke of Burgundy.\n\nAt this moment, the Orleans-party were in great distress, and knew not\nwhere to save themselves; for the instant any of them were discovered,\nwhether secular or ecclesiastic, they were arrested and imprisoned, and\nsome executed,--others heavily fined. Two monks were arrested at this\ntime, namely, master Peter Fresnel, bishop of Noyon, who was taken by\nsir Anthony de Craon, and carried from Noyon to the castle of Crotoy;\nthe other, the abbot of Foresmoustier, was made prisoner by the lord\nde Dampierre, admiral of France. They were soon delivered on paying a\nlarge ransom, when each returned to his bishoprick and monastery.\n\nThe lord de Hangest, still calling himself grand master of the french\ncross-bows, being attached to the Orleans-party, had, after the retreat\nfrom St Denis, secretly retired to the castle of Soissons. Having a\ndesire to attempt regaining the king\u2019s favour, he sent a poursuivant\nto demand a safe conduct from Troullart de Moncaurel, bailiff and\ngovernor of Senlis, for him to come and reside in that town. The safe\nconduct was sent to him, and he came to Senlis; but, because there was\nno mention of his return in this permission, Troullart made him and\nfifteen other gentlemen prisoners in the king\u2019s name. Shortly after,\nthey were carried to the Ch\u00e2telet in Paris, to his great displeasure,\nbut he could not prevent it.\n\nThe count de Roussy also had retired, after the retreat from St Denis,\nto his castle of Pont \u00e1 Arsy sur Aine; but it was instantly surrounded\nby the peasants of the Laonnois, who increased to about fifteen\nhundred, and made most terrible assaults on the castle,--and, in spite\nof its deep moat and thick walls, they damaged it very much. These\npeasants called themselves the king\u2019s children. Sir Brun de Barins,\nknight, bailiff of the Vermandois, and the provost of Laon, came to\nassist and to command them,--when the count, perceiving the danger he\nwas in, to avoid falling into the hands of these peasants, surrendered\nhimself and his castle to the bailiff of the Vermandois, on condition\nthat his own life, and the lives of all within it, should be spared.\nThe bailiff accepted the terms, and, having re-garrisoned it with the\nking\u2019s troops, carried the count and his men prisoners to Laon, where\nthey remained a long time; but at length, on paying a heavy ransom,\nthey obtained their liberty.\n\nThe archdeacon of Brie was, in like manner, taken in the tower of\nAndely by these peasants. He was natural son to the king of Armenia.\nSir William de Coussy, who was of the Orleans-party, retired to his\nbrother in Lorraine, who was bishop of Metz.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XL.\n\n    THE DUKES OF ACQUITAINE AND BURGUNDY MARCH TO CONQUER ESTAMPES\n    AND DOURDAN.----THE EXECUTION OF SIR MANSART DU BOS AND OTHER\n    PRISONERS.\n\n\nDuring these tribulations, there were so many grievous complaints made\nto the king and the princes at Paris, of the mischiefs done to the\ncountry by the garrisons of Estampes and Dourdan, that notwithstanding\nit had been determined in council that neither the king nor the duke\nof Acquitaine should take the field until the winter should be passed,\nthis resolution was overruled by circumstances.\n\nOn the 23d day of November, the duke of Acquitaine, accompanied by the\nduke of Burgundy, the counts of Nevers, de la Marche, de Penthievre,\nde Vaudemont, and the marshal de Boucicaut, with others of rank, and a\ngreat multitude of the Parisians on foot, marched out of Paris, with\nthe intent to reduce to the king\u2019s obedience the garrisons of Estampes\nand Dourdan, and some others, who continued the war on the part of the\nduke of Orleans and his adherents.\n\nHe halted at Corbeil to wait for the whole of his forces,--and thence,\nwith an immense quantity of warlike stores and bombards, with other\nartillery, marched his army toward Estampes, wherein was sir Louis\nde Bourdon, who instantly withdrew into the castle. The townsmen\nimmediately returned to their former obedience, and were kindly\nreceived by the duke of Acquitaine, in consideration of his uncle the\nduke of Berry. Sir Louis de Bourdon, however, refused to surrender,\nalthough he was summoned many times, when the castle was besieged on\nall sides. The lord de Ront was at this time prisoner there,--for he\nhad been taken by sir Louis not long before the arrival of the duke of\nAcquitaine.\n\nMany engines were now pointed against the walls, which they damaged in\nseveral places; and in addition, miners were employed to underwork the\ntowers. The siege was carried on with such vigour that the garrison,\nthinking it probable they should be taken by storm, opened a parley,\nand, by means of the lord de Ront, surrendered themselves to the duke\nof Acquitaine. Sir Louis de Bourdon, with some other gentlemen, his\nconfederates, were sent to the Ch\u00e2telet at Paris. Great part of the\nwealth of Bourdon, with a most excellent courser of his, were given to\nthe lord de Ront, to make amends for the losses which he sustained when\nhe was made prisoner.\n\nThe dukes of Acquitaine and Burgundy re-garrisoned this place, and\nthen returned with their army to Paris; for in truth, they could not,\nfrom the severity of the winter, make any further progress. A few days\nafter, by order of the duke of Burgundy, many noble prisoners were\ncarried from Paris to the castle of Lille; among whom were the lord de\nHangest, sir Louis de Bourdon, the lords de Gerennes, des Fontaines,\nsir John d\u2019Amboise and others, who had been arrested for supporting the\nparty of the duke of Orleans. They suffered a long confinement, but\nwere set at liberty on paying a heavy fine.\n\nAt this period, sir Mansart du Bos was beheaded in the market-place\nof Paris, his body hung by the shoulders on the gibbet at Montfaucon,\nand his head affixed to the spike on the top of the market-house.\nThis execution took place at the instance of the duke of Burgundy,\nbecause sir Mansart was his liege man, nevertheless he had sent him his\nchallenge at the same time with the brothers of Orleans, as has been\nbefore noticed. Not all the solicitations of his friends could save\nhim, and he had many of weight with the duke, who endeavoured earnestly\nto obtain his pardon; but it was in vain, for the duke had resolved\nupon his death.\n\nThere were in the prisons of the Ch\u00e2telet, and in other prisons of\nParis, very many of the Orleans-party who perished miserably through\ncold, famine, and neglect. When dead, they were inhumanly dragged\nout of the town, and thrown into the ditches a prey to dogs, birds,\nand wild beasts. The reason of such cruel conduct was their having\nbeen several times denounced from the pulpits, and proclaimed from\nthe squares, as excommunicated persons. It seemed, however, to many\ndiscreet men, as well noble as of the church, that it was a great\nscandal thus to treat those who were Christians and acknowledged the\nlaws of JESUS CHRIST.\n\nThe same rigorous conduct being persevered in, a short time after,\na valiant knight, called sir Peter de Famechon, was beheaded in the\nmarket-place of Paris: he was of the household and family of the duke\nof Bourbon,--and his head was affixed to a lance like the others. The\nduke of Bourbon was much exasperated at his death, especially when he\nwas informed of the disgraceful circumstances that had attended it. At\nthis time, therefore, all who sided with the Armagnacs, and were taken,\nran great risk of their lives; for there were few that dared speak in\ntheir favour, however near their connexions might be.\n\n\nEND OF THE SECOND VOLUME.\n\n\n  AT THE HAFOD PRESS,\n  BY JA.

Q. Salines?\n\n[7] This battle was fought on the plains of Eichtfeld, near Tongres.\n\n[8] The lord d\u2019Agimont, son to the lord of Rochefort, and the lord de\nSaraing, according to Placentius.\n\n[9] There seems to have been some pretext, on the score of retaliation,\nfor the commission of these barbarities, the insurgents, during the\ntime of their power, having exercised many similar enormities against\nthose of the government faction.\n\n[10] John, third son of Louis I. and brother of Louis II. de Ch\u00e2lons,\ncounts of Auxerre.\n\n[11] Mentioned in p. 23.\n\n[12] Amblard I. lord of La Ba\u00fbme, had issue, Peter, Perceval, _John_,\nWilliam, and Louis. John was a monk at Ambronnai; but Perceval, who\ncontinued the line, had issue, Amblard II. and William, surnamed\nMorelet, who was grand butler of Burgundy in 1430. Perhaps he is the\n_great lord_ here meant.\n\n[13] Mentioned in vol. i. p. 135.\n\n[14] John III. lord of Crequy and Canaples, is mentioned by Froissart.\nHe had issue, John IV. lord of Crequy, &c. _Reginald_, killed at\nAgincourt, and others.\n\n[15] Escoquehen.

I do not find a queen of Portugal in the catalogue\nof her children; but this event seems to be here strangely misplaced.\nTurquet says, \u2018L\u2019an suyvant, 1418, d\u00e9c\u00e9da la royne D.

He married Philippa, daughter to king\nHenry of England by Eleanora his second wife.\n\n_Eric_ X. king of Denmark, &c. son of Wratislaus duke of Pomerania by\nMary of Mecklenburg, niece to Margaret, _the Semiramis of the north_.\nHis great aunt, Margaret, was still alive.\n\n[21] See before, vol. i. p. 57.\n\n[22] Margaret of Bavaria, sister to the emperor Robert, married Charles\nthe bold, duke of Lorraine.\n\n[23] Margaret, heiress of Vaudemont, married Frederick, brother of\nCharles duke of Lorraine.\n\n[24] Q. Who was this?\n\n[25] John le Maingre, second of the name, count of Beaufort and\nviscount of Turenne. He was the son of mareschal Boucicaut the elder,\nmentioned by Froissart, who died in 1371. He was himself made a\nmareschal of France in 1391, having been knighted, nine years before,\nat the battle of Rosebec in Flanders. He went into Hungary and was\npresent at the battle of Nicopolis, and made prisoner with John count\nof Nevers. He was again appointed to the relief of the emperor of\nConstantinople in 1399. In 1401, he was made governor of Genoa,--and\nhe took the city of Famagousta in Cyprus for the Genoese. He was made\nprisoner at Agincourt, and died in England 1421. He was a poet as well\nas warrior, and composed many rondeaux and virelays. In his epitaph, he\nis called Constable to the emperor of Constantinople.\n\n[26] See Shepherd\u2019s Life of Poggio, p. 42.\n\n[27] Robert Hallam, cardinal, and chancellor of the university of\nOxford.\n\n[28] Brandac.

See vol i. p. 63.\n\n[30] Ladislaus, or Lancelot, son of Charles of Durazzo, and brother to\nJoan II. who succeeded to the crown of Naples on his death in 1412.\n\nHe took up arms on behalf of Gregory, and invaded the florentine\nterritories in the year 1409, at the head of a large body of forces.\nThe proceedings of the council were in fact detrimental to him, as\nby its decree he was deposed, and the neapolitan crown vested in his\ncompetitor, the duke of Anjou. He had also seized many towns in the\npatrimony of St Peter, and among the rest on Rome itself.--See _Poggio_\n_Hist. Florent._ p. 178. et seq.\n\n[31] Flisque. Q. Fiesco?\n\n[32] Elizabeth, daughter of John duke of Luxembourg, brother of\nWenceslaus king of Bohemia, and _ci-devant_ emperor. See vol. i. p. 63.\n\n[33] John lord of Puisaye, fifth son to the duke of Bar.\n\n[34] Bona, third daughter of the duke of Bar, married to Waleran count\nof St Pol.\n\n[35] Charles de Montagu, to whom the confiscated honours of the vidame\ndu Laonnois and lord of Marcoussy were restored after the death of his\nfather. There was no issue of this marriage with Catherine d\u2019Albret.\n\n[36] Margaret de Clisson, widow of John de Blois and mother of Oliver,\ncounts of Penthievre.\n\n[37] John Maria and Philip Maria, sons of John Galeas, and successively\ndukes of Milan.\n\n[38] Theodore Pal\u00e6ologus, second marquis of Montferrat. He married,\nfirst, a daughter of the duke of Bar, and, secondly, a princess of\nthe house of Savoy. His daughter Sophia was married to Philip Maria\nVisconti, then count of Pavia, afterwards duke of Milan.\n\n[39] Facino Cane, a captain of great reputation, and partisan of John\nMaria Visconti, duke of Milan.\n\n[40] Gaing. Q. Gavi?\n\n[41] Noefville. Q. Novara, or Novi?\n\n[42] Q. Louis king of Sicily? or Charles king of Navarre? Probably the\nlatter.\n\n[43] John VI. count of Roucy and Braine, son of Hugh count de Roucy\nand Blanche of Coucy. He married Isabel de Montagu, and was killed at\nAgincourt.\n\n[44] The lords of Antoing and princes of Espinoy were a younger branch\nof the house of Melun, counts of Tancarville. John I. viscount of\nMelun, was grandfather both to the count of Tancarville and the lord\nd\u2019Antoing, mentioned in this volume.\n\n[45] Guichard Dauphin, descended from the old counts de Clermont,\ndauphins of Auvergne, grand master from 1409 to 1413. He was son to\nGuichard Dauphin I. grand master of the cross-bows.\n\n[46] Amadeus VIII. the first duke of Savoy, son of Amadeus VII. and\nBona daughter to the duke of Berry.\n\n[47] Bernard VII. brother of John III. count of Armagnac, killed at\nAlexandria della Paglia, as related by Froissart. This count was a\nman of the most unbounded ambition, and had already, in the forcible\nseizure of the county of Fesenzaguet, (the appanage of a younger branch\nof Armagnac) and the murder of its count, Geraud III. and his two sons,\ndiscovered an unprincipled cruelty of disposition, remarkable even at\nthis calamitous period of history. He married Bona of Berry, the widow\nof Amadeus VII. and mother of Amadeus VIII. above mentioned.\n\n[48] Martin king of Sicily, by whose death without issue the king of\nArragon was deprived of male heirs. The island of Sardinia was at this\ntime divided between the genoese and arragonian factions. The chief of\nthe former was Brancaleon d\u2019Oria, whose sister was married to William\ncount of Narbonne. Turquet calls him Aimery,--and says that the king\nof Sicily was not killed, but died a natural death at Cagliari, after\nobtaining a victory over the confederates.\n\n[49] Q. Angennes? John d\u2019Angennes, lord de la Louppe, was governor of\nDauphin\u00e8 and afterwards of the Louvre, and enjoyed great credit at\ncourt.\n\n[50] This Yvain Graindos is a strange corruption, if any corruption\nin the french nomenclature can be strange to a practised ear, of Owen\nGlendower, who, as Rapin says, \u2018upon the Welch unanimously renouncing\ntheir allegiance to the crown of England, and acknowledging him for\nsovereign, from thenceforward always styled himself Prince of Wales, as\nappears from several acts.\u2019\n\n[51] In a battle fought May 14. 1405. See Rapin\u2019s History of England\n_in loco_.\n\n[52] De Dolhaing. Q. D\u2019Olhaing?\n\n[53] I suppose Monstrelet must mean Jagellon, grand duke of Lithuania,\nwho was called to the throne of Poland in 1386, on condition that\nhe would become a Christian, marry the daughter of the late king,\nand annex Lithuania to Poland. This last condition, however, was not\ncompletely fulfilled until the reign of Sigismond Augustus in 1569.\n\n  _Baudran._\n\nJagellon took the name of Uladislaus V. on his baptism; but Hedwige,\ndaughter to the king of Poland, reigned two years before she married\nUladislaus.\n\n  _Anderson._\n\n\n[54] Sigismond was king of Hungary in 1387,--roman emperor 1411,--king\nof Bohemia 1419,--died 1437, aged 70. He married for his second wife\nBarbara, daughter to Hermannus II. count of Cilly in Crain.\n\n  _Anderson._\n\n\n[55] Of the half blood. See p. 138.\n\n[56] _I. e._ Bari.\n\n[57] Probably Nicholas d\u2019Este, connected by marriage with the house of\nMalatesta.\n\n[58] Probably Pandulph Malatesta, lord of Rimini, a captain of great\nreputation and adherent of king Ladislaus.\n\n[59] Sir Raoul de Gaucourt, successively promoted to the posts of\nchamberlain, governor of Dauphin\u00e8, and grand master of the household,\nbecame a distinguished actor in the wars with the English, from 1427 to\n1437 particularly.\n\nThere was also a sir Eustace de Gaucourt, lord of Vicy, who was grand\nfalconer in 1406 and 1412.\n\n[60] Count de Hembe. Q.\n\n[61] Charles de Mouroufle. Q.\n\n[62] The author of \u2018An Account of Livonia, with a Relation of the Rise,\nProgress and Decay of the Marian Teutonic Order,\u2019 London, 1701, relates\nthese transactions in the manner following:\n\n\u2018The order was now on the highest pinnacle of prosperity and honour,\nexceeding great kings and potentates of Europe in extent of dominions,\npower and riches, when Ulricus \u00e0 Jungingen was chosen great master; but\nhe being of a boisterous, fiery temper, soon broke the peace concluded\nbetween Poland with his brother Conradus \u00e0 Jungingen, whereupon\nking Uladislaus Jagellon joining forces with his father Witoldas of\nLithuania, formed an army of 150,000 fighting men and marched into\nPrussia. To stop the progress of this formidable army, the great master\ndrew up as many forces as he could, and, after the Livonians had\njoined him, found his army consisted, in a general muster, of 83,000\nwell armed stout combatants; and thus, with an undaunted spirit, he\nmarched forth to meet his enemy. Such a battle as this was never heard\nof before in these parts, and was given the 15th day of July 1410 in\nPrussia, near the town Gilgenbourg, between the two villages Tannenberg\nand Grunwald, on a large plain, with such obstinacy that, according\nto an exact computation, there were actually killed, on both sides,\n100,000 on the spot. The Poles got the victory, but lost 60,000 men.\nThe order lost 40,000,--but among them almost all their generals and\ncommanders. The great master himself, and the chief of the order, with\n600 noble german marian knights, were there slain. There is still\nkept every year a day of devotion upon that plain, in a chapel built\nto the remembrance of this battle, marked with the date of the year\nit happened, and this inscription, _Centum mille occisi_. The king of\nPoland was so weakened by this dear-bought victory that he very readily\nagreed to a peace. This memorable battle is called The Battle of\nTannenberg.\u2019\n\n[63] Moreri says, that the good duke Louis died at Monbucan on the 19th\nof August 1410. By his wife Anne, dauphiness of Auvergne and countess\nof Forez, he left John count of Clermont, his son and successor:\nhis other children, Louis and two daughters, died without issue and\nunmarried. He left also a natural son, named Hector, who was killed at\nthe siege of Soissons in 1414.\n\n[64] Boulogne, the property of the duke of Berry, by marriage with\nJane, heiress of Auvergne and Boulogne.\n\n    The county of Estampes belonged to the duke of Berry,\n    Valois, I believe, to the count d\u2019Alen\u00e7on,\n    Beaumont to the duke of Orleans,--and\n    Clermont to the duke of Bourbon.\n\n\n[65] Vinchestre, or rather Winchester,--now called Bic\u00eatre, was a\npalace built by a bishop of Winchester 1290. For further particulars,\nsee \u2018Sauval Antiquit\u00e8s de Paris\u2019, vol. ii. book vii.\n\n[66] I hardly know whether this can be the celebrated archbishop of\nRheims, and historian of the reign of Charles VI. who was one of the\nmost learned men of his time, and died at an advanced age, in 1474.\nHe had two brothers older than himself, William des Ursins, baron\nof Treynel, chancellor of France in 1445, and again in 1464,--and\nJames Juvenal des Ursins, who was archbishop of Rheims before him.\nThe history written by Juvenal des Ursins occupies the space from\n1380 to 1422, and throws great light, by comparison, on Froissart and\nMonstrelet.\n\n[67] Q. De Nesle?\n\nGuy III. de Nesle, lord of Offemont and Mello, was grand master of the\nhousehold to queen Isabella, and was killed at Agincourt. His two sons,\n_John_ III. and Guy IV. followed him in succession. He had a third son,\nwho died with him at Agincourt.\n\n[68] Monstrelet apparently mistakes. According to Moreri, _Robert_ duke\nof Bar died this year, leaving issue by his wife Mary (daughter to John\nking of France),\n\n    1. Henry lord d\u2019Ossy, who died in Hungary, 1396, leaving by his\n    wife Mary de Coucy, countess of Soissons, one son, Robert count\n    of Marle and Soissons, killed at Agincourt.\n\n    2. Philip, died in Hungary 1396.\n\n    3. Edward III. marquis du Pont, and duke of Bar after his\n    father\u2019s death.\n\n    4. Louis cardinal of Bar.\n\n    5. Charles lord of Nogent.\n\n    6. John lord of Puisaye. (Both Edward and John were killed at\n    Agincourt.)\n\n    7. Yoland, queen of Arragon.\n\n    8. Mary, countess of Namur.\n\n    9. Bona, countess of St Pol.\n\nOne striking peculiarity is discernible in this table, viz. the\npreference shown in the succession to Edward the third son, over\nRobert, son of the eldest son of the deceased duke; but this was\naccording to the law of many feudal tenures, which took no notice of\nour universally-established doctrine of _representation_ in descents.\nThe same law prevailed in Artois, and was the ground of that famous\ndecision by which Robert d\u2019Artois was ejected in the middle of the\nfourteenth century, and in consequence of which he retired in disgust\nto the court of our Edward III. who asserted the justice of his\npretensions.\n\n[69] He was a peer as duke of Burgundy, and again a peer as\ncount-palatine of Burgundy.\n\n[70] John, called count de Ligny, third son of John count of Brienne,\nbrother to the count de St Pol.\n\n[71] James de Ch\u00e2tillon was appointed admiral in 1408, in the room\nof Clugnet de Breban. He was lord of Dampierre, and son of Hugh de\nCh\u00e2tillon, formerly master of the cross-bows.\n\n[72] Nephew of duke Edward. See p. 232.\n\n[73] The advice which, according to Stowe, king Henry gave to the duke\nof Burgundy on this occasion was deserving of more attention than he\nwas disposed to pay to it. \u2018The duke of Burgoyne, desiring the king\u2019s\naid against the duke of Orliance, promised many things,--amongst the\nwhich he promised his daughter in marriage to the prince, and a great\nsum of gold with her. To whom the king answered: \u2018We advertise you not\nto fight with your enemie in this case, who justly seemeth to vexe\nyou, for the death of his father by you procured, but as much as in\nyou lyeth endeavor yourself to mitigate the young man\u2019s wrath, and\npromise to make him reasonable satisfaction, according to the advice\nof your friends; and if then he will not cease from persecuting you,\nget you into the strongest place of your dominion, and there gather\nsuch power as may be able to put off his force. If then, after this,\nhe will make war against you, you shall have the juster occasion to\nfight with him,--and in such case we will shew you such favour as yee\nhave demaunded.\u2019 Thus there were sent over to his ayde Thomas earl of\nArundell, Gilbert Umfreville earl of Angus, or earl of Kyme, sir Robert\nUmfreville, sir John Oldcastle, lord Cobham, sir John Grey and William\nPorter, with twelve hundred archers,\u2019 &c. &c.\n\n[74] According to the catalogue in Moreri, Arnauld de Corbie, lord of\nJoigny, was at this time chancellor.\n\n[75] Called William Porter by Stowe.\n\n[76] Q. If this is not _Umfreville_ earl of Angus and _Kyme_ (as Stowe\ncalls him)? There was at this period no Neville earl of Kent. The\nonly earl of Kent of that family was William Nevil lord Falconbridge,\ncreated 1461. I find this conjecture somewhat confirmed by the\noriginal, which is, \u2018Ousieville comte de Kam.\u2019 It is true, that\nHolinshed mentions the earls of Pembroke and of _Kent_ as being of the\nexpedition: but he cites Monstrelet as his authority, and is therefore\nlikely to be mistaken.\n\n[77] \u2018Que _\u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s_ elle _ne_ mourast de deuil.\u2019 \u2018That she was\nwithin a little of dying with grief.\u2019 Mary of Berry, daughter of John\nduke of Berry, and wife to John duke of Bourbon (her third husband, she\nhaving been before twice a widow, first of Louis de Ch\u00e2tillon count\nof Dunois, and, secondly, of the constable d\u2019Eu), lived till the year\n1434, when she died at Lyons. See Morery. Her children by the duke of\nBourbon were Charles, duke of Bourbon after his father,--Louis, who\ndied young,--and another Louis, founder of the line of Montpensier.\n\n[78] John II. lord of Rieux and Rochefort. According to Morery\u2019s\ncatalogue, two mareschals were created this year,--Louis lord of\nLoigny, and James lord of Heilly, commonly called Mareschal of\nAcquitaine.\n\n[79] See p. 328.\n\n\n[Transcriber's Note:\n\nInconsistent spelling and hyphenation are as in the original.\n\nSeven instances of \u201cPier-vves\u201d changed to read \u201cPier-Yves\u201d; and one\ninstance of \u201cPierre-vves\u201d changed to read \u201cPierre-Yves.\u201d]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Chronicles of Enguerrand de\nMonstrelet, Volume 2 (of 13), by Enguerrand de Monstrelet\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK CHRONICLES--ENGUERRAND MONSTRELET, VOL 2 ***\n\n***** This file should be named 52607-0.txt or 52607-0.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/5/2/6/0/52607/\n\nProduced by Wayne Hammond and The Online Distributed\nProofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net (This file was\nproduced from images generously made available by The\nInternet Archive)\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will\nbe renamed.\n\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United\nStates without permission and without paying copyright\nroyalties.

I.\n\n    THE CONCLUSION OF THE DUCHESS OF ORLEANS\u2019 ADVOCATE AGAINST THE\n    DUKE OF BURGUNDY, AND THE REPLY FROM THE CHANCELLOR.\n\n\nThe chancellor of France, in the king\u2019s name, ordered the duchess\u2019s\nadvocate, master William Cousinot, to draw up such conclusions as\nshould be satisfactory to the duchess and her son, the duke of Orleans.\nThe advocate, after many excuses, began by showing how pitiable their\nstate was, and took for his theme part of the 7th chapter of the gospel\nof St Luke, \u2018H\u00e6c vidua erat quam cum vidisset Dominus misericordia\nmotus est super eam.\u2019\n\n\u2018Most noble prince, when our Lord entered a city called Nain, he met\nthe corpse of a young man, which his friends were carrying to the\ngrave; and when he noticed that the mother of the young man was a\nwidow, he was on this account moved with compassion toward her, and\nrestored her son to life. I may most truly apply these words to my\nlady of Orleans, for she is a widow who bewails the death of her lord\nand husband, and our lord will have compassion on her; for the king\nis our lord, in respect of terrestrial jurisdiction; and not only the\nking, but thou, lord of Acquitaine, and all other princes of this world\nhaving territorial powers, seeing my lady of Orleans thus disconsolate,\nought to feel compassion for her, and give her aid and support in\nprocuring strict justice to be done for the cruel death of her husband.\n\n\u2018In every case, and at all times, full justice should be administered\nto all; for, according to the words of the Psalmist, it is a good and\nmeritorious act,--\u2018Beati qui custodiunt judicium et faciunt justitiam\nin omni tempore.\u2019 Psalm cv.\n\n\u2018But justice should always be more rigorously observed in regard\nto widows and orphans, who have been deprived of their fathers or\nhusbands, than in any other case; for the divine, canon and civil\nlaws urge the necessity of succouring the widow and orphan. We have\nthe first instance of this in the 22d chapter of Jeremiah,--\u2018Facite\njudicium et justitiam, et liberate vi oppressum de manu calumniatoris,\npupillum et viduam,\u2019 &c.\n\n\u2018In regard to the canon law, the decrees declare, that it is very\nproper for kings to do justice and execute judgment, and deliver from\nthe hands of the oppressors widows and orphans who are injuriously used\nby them.\n\n\u2018As for the civil law, it is very clear, that widows and orphans are\nparticularly privileged in many cases, as may be seen in different law\nwritings.\n\n\u2018My lady of Orleans has lost her husband: her children have lost their\nfather, certainly one of the handsomest and most accomplished princes\nin Christendom. But let us see how they have lost him: had he been\ntaken from them by a natural death, their case would not have been so\nmuch to be pitied; but he is cut off violently in the flower of his\nyouth. In truth, this is such an outrage that every law and customary\nproceeding should bend in their favour against the malignant author of\nthe deed.\n\n\u2018In the first place, our king and sovereign lord is bounden\nparticularly by the commands of God, to whom he cannot be disobedient\nwithout sinning, to execute judgment, according to the words of\nJeremiah in the chapter before mentioned,--\u2018In memetipso juravi, dicit\nDominus, quia in solitudine erit domus vestra.\u2019 And this is conformable\nto the reply made by St Remy to king Clovis when he baptised him. The\nking asked him how long the kingdom of France would endure. The saint\nanswered, that it would last so long as justice should reign there. The\nconverse of which is, that when justice shall cease to be administered,\nthe kingdom will fall. To the king therefore may be applied what is\nwritten in the canon law, \u2018Quod justitia est illud quod suum firmat\nimperium.\u2019\n\n\u2018O, duke of Acquitaine! thou art he who, after the king, art bound\nto do justice according to the words of the Psalmist, \u2018Deus judicium\ntuum regi da et justitiam tuam filio regis.\u2019 Thou art the eldest son\nto the king, to whom, by the grace of God, thou wilt succeed, and be\nour lord: attend to our case for the love of God, for to thee more\nparticularly does it belong; and if thou dost not lay thy hand on it,\nwhen thou shalt come to reign, thou mayest find thy kingdom desolate\nand destroyed,--for each will in his turn seize parts of it, and be the\nmaster, should this atrocious crime remain unpunished.\n\n\u2018Ye also, my lords, princes, dukes and counts of the royal blood,\nrelations of the late duke, and ye other nobles, who have an affection\nfor the king\u2019s crown and honour, what ought to be your conduct on\nthis occasion? Why, certainly, if the king will not interfere in this\nmatter, ye ought to take up the business and execute judgment; for ye\nare bound by oath to guard and defend the king\u2019s honour against all who\nmay infringe upon it. This ye have done in former times, through God\u2019s\ngrace, and for which this kingdom has gained greater glory than any\nother realm in Christendom: insomuch that the English, the Germans, and\nother foreigners, have come hither to seek for justice.\n\n\u2018My lords, for the love of God, let your loyalty burst forth, according\nto your oaths, in behalf of my lady of Orleans, as she has the fullest\nconfidence it will; for, after God and the king, you are her only\nrefuge. Let no one fear to do justice, from the scandal or persecution\nthat may ensue, for it is a maxim of law, \u2018Utilius est scandalum nasci\nac permitti, quam ut veritas relinquatur,\u2019--although it were certain\nthe doing justice in this case would cause much grievous persecution\nto ensue. Yet for all this justice should not be neglected; for in\nthat case you would be indeed reproachable, if, through fear of the\noffender, you shall not dare to decree justice. On no occasion should\njustice be neglected: therefore, my lords, act according to what the\nprophet says, \u2018Viriliter agite, et confortetur cor vestrum et sustinete\nDominum.\u2019\n\n\u2018In truth, if ye do not act with courage, for one inconvenience that\nmay happen, by executing judgment, one hundred would ensue from default\nof justice. Therefore, my lords, do not hesitate to do justice to my\nlady of Orleans and her children from any dread of inconveniences\nthat may happen, but follow the dictates of our Lord,--\u2018Judicare\npupillo et humili ut non apponat magnificare se homo super terram.\u2019\nLet the punishment be so exemplary that none other may henceforth\ncommit so great or so disgraceful a crime, and that it may be held\nin perpetual memory and abhorrence. This is the object of my lady of\nOrleans and her children, namely, that the crime may be atoned for as\nheavily as possible in this world. In order that this atonement may\nbe made, my lady of Orleans and her children would willingly take the\nlegal steps for the infliction of capital punishment, if this could\nregularly be done; but as these steps, according to the customary\nusage of France, belong to the king\u2019s attorney-general alone, they\npropose that the offender shall be punished in manner following,--that\nis to say, by sentence of the king and of the court, be it ordered\nthat our adversary, the duke of Burgundy, be brought to the castle of\nthe Louvre, or elsewhere, according to the king\u2019s pleasure and that\nof my clients, and there, in the presence of the king, of my lord of\nAcquitaine, and the other princes of the blood, as well as of the\ncouncil and people, the duke of Burgundy, without hood or girdle,\nshall, on his knees, publicly confess, with a loud voice, before my\nlady of Orleans, her children, and as many other persons as she may\nplease, that maliciously and treacherously he has had my lord of\nOrleans assassinated, through hatred, envy and ambition, and for no\nother cause, notwithstanding all the charges made against him, and\nother imputations thrown on his character, to justify and exculpate\nhimself from so base a deed; and shall demand pardon from my lady of\nOrleans and her children, most humbly supplicating them to forgive his\noffences, declaring that he knows of nothing prejudicial to the honour\nand reputation of the said duke of Orleans deceased, and recals all he\nmay have said or published to the contrary.\n\n\u2018In this state he shall be carried to the court of the palace, and to\nthe h\u00f4tel de Saint Pol, the residence of the king, and to the spot\nwhere the murder was committed, and there, on high stages erected for\nthe purpose, he shall repeat the above words before such commissioners\nas my lady of Orleans and her son may please to appoint. He shall\nremain on his knees, at the last place, until priests nominated for\nthe purpose shall have recited the seven penitential psalms, said the\nlitany, and the other parts of the burial service, for the soul of the\ndeceased, after which he shall kiss the earth, and ask pardon of God,\nof my lady of Orleans, and of her children, for the offences he has\ncommitted against them.\n\n\u2018The manner and form of this recantation, and begging pardon, shall be\nwritten out, and copies sent to all the different towns in the kingdom\nwith orders for the magistrates to have them proclaimed by sound of\ntrumpet, that it may be notorious to all within and without the realm.\n\n\u2018And as additional reparations for such offences, and that they may\nremain in perpetual remembrance, all the houses belonging to the duke\nof Burgundy in Paris shall be razed to the ground, and remain in ruins\nfor ever. On the places where any of his houses shall have stood, there\nshall be erected handsome crosses of stone, having large and strong\ntablets, on which shall be written a full account of the murder of my\nlate lord, the duke of Orleans, and the cause of these houses being\ndestroyed.\n\n\u2018On the spot where my late lord was murdered shall be erected a similar\ncross; and the house wherein the murderers hid themselves shall be\npulled down. This spot, and the adjoining houses, the duke of Burgundy\nshall be forced to purchase, and to build thereon a handsome college\nfor six canons, six vicars, and six chaplains, whose nominations shall\nremain with my lady of Orleans and her heirs. In this college six\nmasses shall be said every day for the soul of the deceased duke of\nOrleans, and high mass at the usual time of canonical hours. For the\nsupport of this college there shall be a mortmain rent of one thousand\nlivres parisis; and the whole shall be well furnished with dresses,\nbooks, chalices, ornaments, and all other necessaries, at the sole\nexpense of the duke of Burgundy; and over the entrance shall be written\nin large letters the cause of its foundation.\n\n\u2018The duke of Burgundy shall, beside, be constrained to found a college\nfor the salvation of the soul of the deceased, in the town of Orleans,\nconsisting of twelve canons, twelve vicars, and twelve clerks, which\ncollege shall bear the name of the defunct; and the nominations to\nit shall belong to my lady of Orleans, and to the heirs of the late\nduke of Orleans. It shall be situated in whatever part of the late\nduke\u2019s possessions in Orleans the duchess shall please, and shall be\nhandsomely constructed, furnished with books and all other necessaries,\nwith an income of two thousand livres parisis; and a similar\ninscription to the one before mentioned shall be placed over the gate.\n\n\u2018For the greater perpetuity of this event, and that it may be made\nknown to all foreign nations, the duke of Burgundy shall be enjoined to\nerect two chapels; the one near the holy sepulchre at Jerusalem, and\nthe other at Rome, and assign to each the annual value of one hundred\nlivres in the coin of those countries, and to provide them with all\nnecessary furniture. In each of these chapels shall a daily mass be\nsaid for the soul of the deceased, and over the doors shall be placed\nthe same inscriptions as over the colleges.\n\n\u2018The duke of Burgundy shall also be constrained to pay the sum of\none million in gold, not to the profit of my lady of Orleans or her\nchildren, but to found and endow hospitals and monasteries, and to\ndistribute in alms and other works of piety for the salvation of the\nsoul of the defunct.\n\n\u2018That this sentence may be carried into due effect, all the lands\nwhich the duke of Burgundy possesses in this kingdom shall be placed\nin the hands of the king, that they may be sold for the accomplishment\nof the above works. The duke of Burgundy shall also be condemned to\nclose imprisonment in whatever place it may please the king, until\nthe above sentence be carried into execution. After which, he shall\nbe banished for ever beyond sea, or at least for the space of twenty\nyears, to bewail and repent of his crime, or until it shall be thought\nhe may have sufficiently done it. On his return, he shall be ordered,\nunder severe penalties, never to approach within one hundred leagues of\nthe queen or the children of the late duke of Orleans, without being\ncondemned to such heavy damages, and other penalties suited to the\nenormity of the case, as shall be held in perpetual remembrance. He\nshall also be condemned to pay whatever costs my lady of Orleans and\nher children may have occurred on this present occasion.\n\n\u2018I say, therefore, that such ought to be the judgment given for them,\nand without delay, considering the notoriety and enormity of the\noffence of our adversary; for it is publicly known, that the duke of\nBurgundy has confessed himself guilty of it. He first made a confession\nof his guilt to my lord of Berry and to the king of Sicily, giving no\nreason for it but that he was urged on by the devil: he then did the\nsame before several noblemen. This ought therefore to weigh against\nhim, and convict him of the crime, without further trial: nor ought\nyou to suffer any sort of colouring to be admitted in palliation of\nhis guilt. He ought not to be heard otherwise than he has been, for\nhe varied not in his confessions to the different persons; and pope\nInnocent approves of this, in his chapter on Free Will, and Guillermus\nde Montleon, in his chapter on Clerical Constitutions. Pope Nicholas\nheld king Lothaire, in like manner, convicted to his prejudice in a\ncertain case, about which he had written to the pope, as appears in\nthe above chapter. This confession of king Lothaire had been made in\na letter, previously to any trial. The duke of Burgundy, therefore,\nought to be condemned from this public confession of his crime in the\npresence of different persons. He has beside made a similar confession\nwhen he appeared publicly before thee, lord of Acquitaine, when thou\ndidst sit in judgment representing the person of the king, and before\nthe princes of the blood and all the council of state. He cannot,\ntherefore, deny his having made such confession before competent\njudges. It follows then, that no further trial is necessary, but that\nsentence should immediately be passed; for confession of guilt should\nbe judged the fullest evidence.\n\n\u2018The law says, \u2018In confitentem null\u00e6 sunt partes judicantis.\u2019 And\nsupposing, that according to some, a sentence is requisite, at least\nit is certain that no trial or examination of the cause is necessary,\nsince this present case is extremely notorious. So has it formerly been\ndetermined by the sentence and judgment of the kings in times past,\nagainst several great lords of their day,--to wit, that when the facts\nwere notorious, no other process or inquisition was required. And so\nshall it be determined, by the grace of God, in the present case,--for\nso reason demands.\n\n\u2018Should it, however, be thought necessary to go into another trial,\nwhich, from all I have said, I cannot suppose, my lady of Orleans\nis ready prepared to bring forward the fullest proof of what I have\nadvanced, and such as must convince all reasonable persons. But as my\nlady can now only offer civil conclusions, and would willingly propose\ncriminal ones, but that it belongs to the king\u2019s attorney-general\naccording to the usage in France,--my lady, therefore, most earnestly\nsupplicates the king\u2019s attorney to join with her, and propose such\nsentence as the law in this case requires.\u2019\n\nThese were the conclusions of my lady of Orleans and her sons,--after\nwhich, the council of the princes of the blood, and others of the\nking\u2019s council, with the approbation of the duke of Acquitaine, made\nthe chancellor reply to the duchess of Orleans, that the duke of\nAcquitaine, as lieutenant for the king, and representing his person,\nand the princes of the blood-royal were well satisfied with her\nconduct respecting her late lord the duke of Orleans: that they held\nhim perfectly exculpated from all the charges that had been brought\nagainst him; and that, in regard to her requests, speedy and good\njustice should be done her, so that she should be reasonably contented\ntherewith.\n\nA few days after, the young duke of Orleans, Charles, did homage for\nthe duchy of Orleans, and all his other possessions, to his uncle\nCharles king of France: then, taking leave of the queen and dauphin,\nand the princes of the blood who were in Paris, he departed with his\nmen at arms for Blois, whence he had come. The duchess-dowager of\nOrleans remained in Paris.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. II.\n\n    GUYE DE ROVE, ARCHBISHOP OF RHEIMS, APPEALS FROM THE\n    CONSTITUTIONS DRAWN UP BY THE UNIVERSITY OF PARIS, WHICH ANGERS\n    THAT BODY, AND THEY IMPRISON HIS COMMISSARY.\n\n\nAt this period, Guy de Roye[1], archbishop of Rheims, who had been\nsummoned specially by the king to attend the meeting of the prelates at\nParis, assembled to consider on the means of uniting the whole church,\nneither came himself nor sent any one in his behalf. He refused to\nagree to the decisions of this council, and sent a chaplain as his\ncommissary, with letters signed with his name and seal, to confirm his\nopposition to all the statutes they had drawn up, as well for himself\nand his diocese as for all his subjects within the province.\n\nThe king and the clergy were much displeased at this conduct; and the\nuniversity of Paris requested that the commissary should be confined in\nclose imprisonment, where he remained for a long time.\n\nThe cardinal of Bordeaux came at this time to Paris, partly for the\nunion of the church; and then also returned thither master Peter Paoul,\nand the patriarch of Alexandria, named master Symon Cramant, who\nhad been sent by the king of France and the university of Paris, as\nambassadors to the two rival popes.\n\nThe assembled prelates were very anxious for their arrival, that they\nmight be better acquainted with the business they had to manage, and on\nwhat grounds they should proceed. Master Peter Paoul frequently rode\nthrough the streets of Paris in his doctor\u2019s dress, accompanied by the\ncardinal riding on one side of his horse as women do. In the presence\nof this cardinal and doctor, the abbot of Caudebec, of the order of\nCistercians, and doctor in theology, proposed, on the part of the\nuniversity, an union of the church. The abbot of St Denis, with other\ndoctors in theology, declared for an union of the universal church;\nand, shortly after, the cardinal departed from Paris for Boulogne, and\nthence went to Calais.\n\nThe abbot of St Denis and another doctor of theology, who had been, by\nthe king\u2019s orders, confined in the prison of the Louvre, were released,\nat the request of the cardinal de Bar, and set at liberty, contrary to\nthe will of the university of Paris. In like manner did the bishop of\nCambray, master Peter d\u2019Ailly, an excellent doctor of theology, gain\nhis liberty. He had been confined at the instance of the university,\nbecause he was not favourable to their sentiments, and was delivered\nat the entreaties of count Waleran de St Pol, and the great council of\nthe king. All Christendom was now divided in religious opinions, as\nto the head of the church, by the contentions of the two rival popes,\nwho could not be brought to agree on the means to put an end to this\ndisgraceful schism.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. III.\n\n    THE DUKE OF BURGUNDY ASSEMBLES A LARGE BODY OF MEN AT ARMS TO\n    SUCCOUR JOHN OF BAVARIA AGAINST THE LIEGEOIS, AND COMBATS THEM.\n\n\nAbout this time, John duke of Burgundy was busily employed in\ncollecting a body of men at arms to aid his brother-in-law, the bishop\nof Liege, whom, as has been said, the Liegeois had driven out of their\ncountry, and besieged in the town of Maestricht. He sent for succour\namong his friends and allies, namely, to Burgundy, Flanders, Artois,\nand the borders of Picardy, whence came very many, and several from\nSavoy.\n\nThe earl of Mar, also, a Scotsman, then at Bruges, with about four\nscore combatants, ready to embark for Scotland, advanced into the\nTournesis, whither the duke came, and had a conference with their\nprincipal captains in the town of Tournay.\n\nOn the eleventh day of September, he marched thence with a\nnumerous body of men at arms, and a great train of artillery and\nbaggage-waggons to Enghien, where he was gladly received by the lord\nof the place. On the morrow, he advanced to Nivelle in Brabant, within\na league of Salmes. He marched next to Flourines, where he met sir\nRichard[2] Daulphin, sir William de Tignonville, lately provost of\nParis, and master William Bouratier, one of the king\u2019s secretaries,\nambassadors to him from the king of France. Having obtained an\naudience, they said they had been sent to him from the king and the\ngreat council on two objects; first, to know whether the Liegeois and\ntheir bishop were willing to submit their differences to the king and\nthe great council; secondly, to inform him of the suit urged against\nhim by the duchess-dowager of Orleans and her children, for the death\nof the late duke of Orleans, his brother, of the replies they had made\nto the charges he had brought against the late duke, and that they\ndemanded instant justice on him the duke of Burgundy, and that neither\nlaw nor reason ought to prevent sentence being passed by the king\naccording to the conclusions that had been drawn up against him.\n\nThe duke of Burgundy shortly answered, that in regard to the first\npoint, he was willing, as was right for him to do, to obey the king\u2019s\norders, but that his brother-in-law, John of Bavaria, who had married\nhis sister, had most earnestly solicited his assistance against the\ncommonalty and his subjects of Liege, who had rebelled, and even held\nhim besieged. Similar requests had been made to duke William, count\nof Hainault, his brother in law, and also brother-in-law to John of\nBavaria: wherefore the armaments could not now be broken up, since\nduring the time the ambassadors would be negotiating between the two\nparties, John of Bavaria, their bishop and lord, might be in great\ndanger from his rebellious subjects, and their success might serve for\nan example and inducement for other subjects to resist their lords, and\ngive rise to an universal rebellion. He added, that the king and his\ncouncil might, without any prejudice to themselves, have refrained from\nso readily listening to such requests, as none of the aforesaid parties\nwere subjects to the kingdom of France.\n\nIn regard to the second point, he, John duke of Burgundy, made answer,\nthat instantly on his return from this expedition he would wait on\nthe king of France, and act towards him, and all others, in a manner\nbecoming a good subject, and the near relationship in which he stood to\nthe king.\n\nThe ambassadors, finding they could not obtain more satisfactory\nanswers to the points on which they were sent, were obliged to be\ncontented. They resolved, however, to wait the event of this expedition\nagainst the Liegeois; and during that time there came to the duke\nof Burgundy, from the country of Hainault, his brother-in-law duke\nWilliam, accompanied by the counts de Conversan, de Namur, and de\nSalines, in Ardennes, with many notable lords, as well knights as\nesquires, from Hainault, Holland, Zealand, Ostrevant, and other\nplaces, to the number of twelve hundred helmets[3], or thereabout, and\ntwo thousand infantry well equipped, with from five to six hundred\ncarriages laden with provision and military stores.\n\nMany councils were held at Flourines, and in that neighbourhood, as\nto their future conduct, and whither they might march their army\nwith the greatest probability of success. It was determined that duke\nWilliam should command the van, and, as he advanced, destroy the whole\ncountry with fire and sword; that the duke of Burgundy, with the earl\nof Mar and the main body, should direct their march along the causeway\nof Branchaut, which leads strait to Tongres and Maestricht. In the\nlast place, the lord de Pier-Yves[4] and the Liegeois had, as has been\nbefore said, besieged their bishop and lord, John of Bavaria.\n\nIn consequence of this resolution, the two dukes began their march\nby different roads, and destroyed all the country on the Tuesday,\nWednesday and Thursday, and met on the Saturday evening, about vespers,\nin the town of Montenach, situated on the above causeway. In this\nplace and neighbourhood was the whole army lodged, forming but one\nbody; and two marshals were appointed to command and find quarters for\nit;--on the part of the duke of Burgundy, the lord de Vergy[5],--and\non that of duke William, the lord de Jeumont. They had under their\nimmediate orders five hundred helmets, seven hundred cross-bows, and\nfifteen hundred archers, all men of tried courage, with sixteen hundred\ncarriages, as well carts as waggons, laden with arms, ammunition and\nprovision, and all other necessaries for such an expedition.\n\nOn this Saturday, the lord de Pier-Yves, and his son the newly-elected\nbishop of Liege, as they were besieging Maestricht, learnt from their\nspies, that the two before-mentioned dukes were rapidly advancing\nagainst them, and burning the country on their line of march. They\ninstantly raised the siege, and retreated to the city of Liege with\nfull forty thousand combatants, where they fixed their quarters, Liege\nbeing only five leagues distant from Maestricht. The commanders there\nheld a council, with such of the inhabitants as had not been at the\nsiege; and at its close it was proclaimed through different parts of\nthe town, by orders of the governor and his son, the bishop, that every\nman capable of bearing arms should, on the morrow-morning, at the sound\nof a bell, be ready equipped to follow their commanders out of the town\nwhithersoever they might lead them.\n\nIn consequence of this order, on the morrow, the 22d day of September\n1408, there issued out of Liege, according to computation, about fifty\nthousand armed men. In this number were from five to six hundred well\narmed, in the french manner, on horseback, and from one hundred to six\nscore english archers, in their pay. They were followed by infinite\nnumbers of carts and other carriages, and a mob of people dressed in\nvarious manners, according to their own fancies.\n\nThe bell tolled at break of day, and they then sallied forth in good\narray, following their governor and bishop, very eager to offer combat\nto the enemy. Their governor had frequently warned them of the dangers\nthat might ensue from a battle, as their enemies were, for the greater\npart, nobles or gentlemen accustomed to war and obedience to their\ncommanders, which was not the case with them; and that it would be more\nto their advantage to remain within well-inclosed towns and castles\nharrassing the enemy by various means, and so tiring him out that he\nshould be forced to quit their country.\n\nThis advice, however, was not agreeable to the Liegeois, for it seemed\nto them that their numbers were so great that the enemy could not\nresist them; and they were not well pleased with what their governor\nhad told them. The governor, perceiving the Liegeois determined on\nbattle, led them into the plain, and drew them up in handsome array. He\nfrequently exhorted them to behave themselves valiantly, and with one\naccord, this day against the enemy, who was marching to attack them,\nand to defend with courage their lives and liberties.\n\nThey marched near to Tongres, which is five leagues distant from Liege,\nwhither the two dukes had advanced on the Saturday; for they had\nalready heard the siege of Maestricht was broken up, and that the men\nof Liege were intending to offer them battle. After some councils had\nbeen holden with the captains and the most experienced in their army,\nthey sent off, very early on the Sunday morning, two hundred light\ntroops, under the command of Robert le Roux and some other noblemen\nof the country, to inquire into the truth of what they had heard, and\nto see what the enemy was about. They shortly returned, and told the\ndukes, that the intelligence they had received was true, for that they\nhad seen the Liegeois in great numbers marching in battle-array. The\ndukes, on hearing this, commanded their men to arm, and to draw up in\norder of battle. When this was done, they marched to meet the Liegeois,\nand scarcely had they advanced half a league when they appeared in\nsight.\n\nThe Liegeois also saw them, for they were near to Tongres. Both armies\nadvancing, the dukes then posted themselves and all their infantry\non a very advantageous spot; and thinking the enemy would attempt to\ndislodge them, they formed their army into one battalion, the better to\nsupport the attack, and placed their baggage in their rear. They posted\nthe greater part of their archers and cross-bows on their right and\nleft as wings. The lord de Miraumont this day commanded the archers, by\norders of the duke of Burgundy, and with great credit to himself. The\nduke of Burgundy was on the right, and duke William on the left of the\narmy, each attended by his own people.\n\nAfter the proper orders had been given, and every arrangement made\naccording to the advice of the most experienced officers, very many\nnew knights were created. The men of Liege, swelled with pride, and\narrogantly considering the army of their opponents as infinitely\ninferior to them, marched on the right for an eminence called the\nheights of Hasbane, where they halted in handsome array. They had with\nthem the standard of St Lambert, and those of their different guilds;\nand the reason why they had halted on this spot was, that some of their\nold men had told them that it was there their ancestors had gained a\nvictory, and they flattered themselves with similar success.\n\nThey then formed their army in handsome order, and played off many\ncannons against their enemies, which annoyed them very much. It should\nbe known, that between the two armies was a narrow valley, at the\nbottom of which was a ditch to carry off the water in times of rain.\n\nThe two dukes having with their army remained stationary, observing\nthat the Liegeois did not seem inclined to quit their position, and\nbegin the battle, held a short council with their ablest officers,\nand thinking success was more likely to follow the most courageous,\ndetermined to advance slowly toward them in battle-array, on account of\nthe weight of their arms, and attack them where they were, before they\ncould fortify themselves, or increase their numbers by reinforcements.\n\nIn consequence, five hundred men at arms, on horseback, were ordered to\nattack the army of Liege on its rear, and about a thousand infantry,\nunder the command of the lords de Croy, de Helly, de Neufville and de\nRaise, knights, with Enguerrand de Bournouville, esquire, on the part\nof the duke of Burgundy; and by the lords de Hamette and de Ligne,\nknights, with Robert le Roux, esquire, who instantly advanced into the\nplain according to their orders.\n\nThe Liegeois, observing so large a detachment quit the duke\u2019s army,\nand march away, as it were, thought they were running off from fear\nof their great numbers, and began shouting, in their language, \u2018Fuyo,\nfuyo!\u2019 and repeating this word many times. The lord de Pier-Yves, the\ngovernor, like an able man, well versed in war, frequently, but gently,\nchecked them for making this noise, saying, \u2018My very dear friends,\nthat troop on horseback which you see, are not running away, as you\nsuppose; but when that other body of infantry, much greater, as you\nmay observe, shall be advanced near enough to begin the attack, those\non horseback will instantly wheel about, like skilful soldiers, and\ncharge your rear, with a design to divide your army, while the others\nshall attack you in front. Notwithstanding we have every appearance\nof a successful issue to our battle, I have always advised you to the\ncontrary; and though your hearts are set upon it, as if already sure\nof victory, I remain still in the same opinion,--because you are not\nso well used to warfare, nor armed like to your adversaries, who have\nlearnt all military exercises from their childhood. This was the reason\nwhy I proposed avoiding a battle; for it would have been more to your\nadvantage to have defended your towns and fortresses, and whenever a\nfavourable opportunity offered, to have fallen on your enemies, so that\nthey would have been forced to have quitted your country. However, the\nday you have so ardently wished for is now come; and I beg of you to\nput your hopes in God, and boldly and steadily exert yourselves in the\ndefence of your country against the enemy now marching to attack you.\u2019\n\nHaving finished this speech, he wanted to mount some of his most\ndetermined men on horseback to oppose the detachment then on the\nplain; but in truth the commonalty would not suffer it to be done, and\nuttered against him many reproaches, calling him a traitor.\n\nHe patiently suffered their rude ignorance, and hastily commanded the\narmy to be formed into a square, in the front of which was a body drawn\nup in the form of a triangle,--and the carts and baggage were towards\nthe rear, on the right and left of his army, handsomely arranged: their\nhorses were in the rear, on one of the wings, intermixed with their\narchers and cross-bows,--but they were of little value, except the\nenglish archers, who were better disposed of in other places.\n\nThe lord de Pier-Yves, accompanied by his son the bishop and some of\nhis best companions in arms, like a good commander, posted himself at\nthe head of his army, fronting the enemy.\n\nDuring this time, the two dukes began their march, gaily exhorting\ntheir men to behave themselves gallantly against the enemy, a rude\nand ignorant people, who had rebelled against their lord, and who\nconfidently trusted in their superior numbers for success,--telling\ntheir men, that if they acted as they expected they would, victory\nwould infallibly be theirs, and they would gain everlasting honour.\n\nWhen the dukes had made such like speeches, they retired to their\nposts, and under their banners, and advanced slowly toward the enemy,\nwho kept up a heavy fire against them with their cannons.\n\nThe banner-bearer of the duke of Burgundy was a very valiant knight,\ncalled sir James de Courtjambe, who, accidentally falling on his knees\nas he marched, alarmed many, who thought it was an unfavourable omen\nof their success; but he was soon raised by the help of those of his\nguard, and behaved himself honourably the whole day. This knight was a\nnative of Burgundy. The banner of duke William was that day borne by\na gallant knight, called sir Hoste d\u2019Escaussines, who behaved himself\nright well.\n\nWhen the two armies met, the conflict became very severe on each side,\nand lasted for upwards of an hour, when many deadly blows were given\nby both parties. At this moment, the detachment on horseback, with\nthe infantry, according to their orders, advanced to the rear of the\nLiegeois; but from the position of their baggage-waggons, they had\nmuch difficulty to force their way. At length, by dint of courage, they\nsucceeded, and, having gained an entrance, began to lay about them so\nvigorously that the army of the enemy was divided,--and they saw full\nsix thousand Liegeois quit their ranks, with their guns and the banners\nof their guilds, and take flight with all speed towards a village half\na league from the field of battle.\n\nWhen the detachment perceived this, they left off the attack they had\nbegun, and pursued the runaways, whom they charged, not once, but\nseveral times, beating down and slaying them without mercy,--and, in\nshort, routed them so effectually that, through fear of death, they\nfled here and there, into woods and other places, to hide themselves.\n\nThis party of the Liegeois being either killed, dispersed, or taken\nprisoners, the horsemen returned to their main body, gallantly fighting\nthe enemy, who, it must be said, defended themselves courageously. In\ntruth, the event of this battle was some time doubtful,--for, during\none half hour, it could not be known which side would be victorious.\nThe noise of their war-cries was frightful:--the Burgundians and\nHainaulters shouted under their banners, \u2018Our Lady for Burgundy! Our\nLady for Hainault!\u2019 and the Liegeois, in their turn, shouted, \u2018St\nLambert for Pier-Yves!\u2019\n\nThe men of Liege would perhaps have conquered, if this detachment on\nhorseback, when returned from the defeat of the runaways, had not again\nfallen on their rear, and behaved so marvellously well that those who\nopposed them were pierced through, and all attempts to check them were\nvain. A great slaughter was made by them in a short time, for none were\nadmitted to ransom; and by their vigour whole ranks fell one over the\nother, for now all the weight and power of the infantry were brought\nagainst them.\n\nThe defeat once begun, there were such heaps of dead and wounded that\nit was melancholy to behold, for they were thicker in many places than\nstooks of corn in harvest. This ought not to occasion surprise; for\nwhen the common people are assembled, badly armed, and puffed up with\ntheir extravagant desires, although they be in great numbers, yet shall\nthey hardly be able to resist an army composed of noblemen well tried\nin arms, even when God shall permit it so to be. At this period of\nthe battle, and near to the banner of the duke of Burgundy, where the\nconflict was the strongest, fell the lord de Pierre-Yves and his two\nsons,--namely, the one who had been elected bishop of Liege and his\nbrother: they were instantly put to death.\n\nThe heir of Salmes[6], who bore the standard of St Lambert, namely,\nthe eldest son to the count de Salmes[6], who was in the army of the\ntwo dukes; sir John Collet, and many other knights and esquires to\nthe amount of upwards of five hundred; all the english archers, and\nabout twenty-eight thousand of the commonalty, were left dead on the\nfield,--and more perished by arrow-shots than by any other weapon.\n\nSir Baldwin de Montgardin, knight, to save his life, surrendered\nhimself to the duke of Burgundy:--he was led out of the engagement, and\nafterward given by the duke to sir Wicart de Bours.\n\nI have no need to particularise the great courage and coolness of the\nduke of Burgundy, nor how he galloped to different parts of the army,\nexhorting them to act well,--nor how, until the end of the battle,\nhe most gallantly behaved himself,--for in truth, his conduct was\nsuch that he was praised and spoken of by all knights and others;\nand although he was frequently covered with arrows and other missile\nweapons, he did not on that day lose one drop of blood.\n\nWhen he was asked after the defeat, if they should cease from slaying\nthe Liegeois, he replied, \u2018Let them all die together! for I will not\nthat any prisoners be made, nor that any be ransomed!!\u2019\n\nIn the like gallant manner did duke William, the other princes, and in\ngeneral the whole body of the chivalry and nobility of the two dukes\nbehave themselves. There were slain from five to six hundred of their\nmen; and among the number were, John de la Chapelle, knight to the\nabove duke,--sir Flourimont de Brimeu, John de la Trimouille, who on\nthis day had been made a knight,--Hugotin de Nambon, John de Theune,\nviscount de Brimequet, a native of Hainault,--Rollant de la Mote, and\nothers, to the amount of one hundred and six score gentlemen: the rest\nwere varlets[7].\n\nJust as the dukes had gained the victory, about two thousand men made\na sally from Tongres, to assist the Liegemen. When they saw they were\ndefeated, they retreated to their town, but were so closely pursued by\nthe body of horse that had done such essential service that very many\nof them were killed.\n\nThe two dukes, seeing their victory was now complete, met, and returned\nthanks to the Creator, congratulating with one another for their\nsuccess. They had tents pitched on the field of battle, and remained\nthere for three days and three nights.\n\nThe french ambassadors, having now taken their leave, departed for\nTournay, and continued their road to Paris to the king and his council;\nbut prior to their departure, the duke of Burgundy had dispatched a\nmessenger to the king of France, with letters to inform him and his\ngood friends in Paris of the fortunate event of the battle. This news\nwas not very agreeable to many who were intending to urge the king\nto prosecute the duke of Burgundy for the murder of the late duke of\nOrleans,--and on the contrary, it gave great joy to his friends.\n\nOn Monday, the morrow of the battle, about the hour of twelve, John\nof Bavaria, bishop of Liege, attended by the heir of Heinseberg, and\nseveral others, nobles and not nobles, to the number of six hundred\nhelmets, or thereabout, came from the town of Maestricht, wherein\nthey had been besieged, to the camp of the two dukes, and most humbly\nthanked them for the succour they had afforded him. He and his party\nwere received with much joy; and, on his arrival, he was presented with\nthe head of the lord de Pier-Yves, which had been found among the dead,\nwith his two sons, and was fixed to the top of a lance, that all who\npleased might see it!\n\nOn the following Tuesday, the feast of St Fremin, a martyr, the\ninhabitants of Liege, Huy, Dinant and Tongres, and of all the other\ngood towns in the bishoprick of Liege, excepting the castle of\nBouillon, hearing of the great destruction of their countrymen, and the\npower of their enemies, were panic-struck, and, seeing no probability\nof any assistance, surrendered themselves to the obedience of the dukes\nof Burgundy and of Holland. They sent to them ambassadors to this\neffect, and also to supplicate John of Bavaria, their bishop and lord,\nthat he would graciously have pity upon them, and grant them his pardon.\n\nThe bishop, through the intercession of the two dukes, complied with\ntheir request, on condition that such as had been most active in\npromoting the rebellion, many of whom were still alive, whose names\nthey would set down, should be given up to the two dukes, to do by them\nas they in their justice should think right; and each of the towns gave\nsufficient hostages for the due performance of the terms.\n\nOn the ensuing Thursday, the two dukes and the bishop, with the whole\narmy, broke up the camp, and advanced toward the town of Liege. The\nduke of Burgundy was quartered in the town of Flauye, on the river\nMeuse, one league distant from Liege, and duke William among the\nmountains.\n\nOn the following Sunday, the dukes and the bishop held a full council,\nto which all their ministers were admitted, on the present state of\naffairs. Other councils were continued until the Tuesday, when the\nbishop made his entry into Liege, and was received with great humility\nby the remnant of its inhabitants. The most culpable in the late\nrebellion had been before arrested and thrown into prison in this and\nin all the other towns.\n\nThe bishop went first to the cathedral church of St Lambert to offer\nhis prayers, and reconcile himself with the chapter: after this he went\nto his palace, when he was most humbly entreated by the people to have\nmercy on them, which he granted; and, shortly after, he returned to the\ncamp of the two dukes.\n\nAbout two o\u2019clock in the afternoon, on the morrow, the dukes and the\nbishop, with several nobles of the army, assembled on an elevated spot\nnear the camp, whither sir John de Jeumont, marshal to duke William,\nby the commands of the two dukes and the bishop, had ordered the heir\nof Rochefort, a rich nobleman, John de Saramie[8], knight, and fifteen\nother citizens, to be brought from the town, and had their heads cut\noff, one after another, by the executioner. Many churchmen, and some\nwomen, were also drowned in the Meuse for having been concerned in the\nrebellion!\n\nOn the morrow, the dukes and the bishop moved with the army to a town\nthree leagues distant, called Beaucloquet, where many conferences\nwere held, on the state of the country. The count de Nevers joined\nhis brother, the duke of Burgundy, at this place, with four hundred\ncombatants. Hither also sir John de Jeumont ordered nineteen citizens\nfrom the town of Huy to be brought, who underwent a similar punishment\nto those of Liege, and for the same cause; and, as before, many\nchurchmen and women were drowned[9].\n\nAm\u00e9 de Viry, a Savoyard, a nobleman well experienced in war, came\nhither also to aid the duke of Burgundy, and accompanied by three\nhundred helmets from that country. When the dukes and the bishop had\nfor several days consulted together on the affairs of Liege, it was at\nlength concluded, with the approbation of John of Bavaria, now surnamed\nJohn the Pitiless, that they should all meet again in the city of\nTournay, on St Luke\u2019s day next ensuing, to determine finally on the\nmeasures to be pursued touching these matters.\n\nAfter many executions had taken place in the bishoprick of Liege\non those who had been concerned in the rebellion, and when the\nfortifications of the towns of Huy, Dinant and others, had been\ndestroyed, the two dukes began their march homeward, taking with them\na number of persons from Liege, who had been given as hostages for the\nobservance of all the articles of the treaty that should be made with\nthem. Some of them were sent by duke William to Mons and Valenciennes,\nand some to Lille, Arras, and other places belonging to the duke of\nBurgundy, who went to his county of Flanders, and duke William to\nHainault, after they had disbanded their men at arms. The greater part\nreturned to their homes much enriched by the plunder of the Liegeois,\nwho, thunderstruck by the misfortune that had befallen them, became\nstupified and indolent.\n\nMany great lords attended the duke of Burgundy on this expedition:\namong them were, from Burgundy, sir John de Ch\u00e2lons[10], sir Gaultier\nde Ruples, the lord de Vergy[11], marshal of Burgundy, the lord de St\nGeorge, sir John de la Balme[12], sir William de Champ-divers, sir\nJames de Courtjambe, the lord de Montagu, and many more. From Picardy,\nthe lords de Croy[13], de Heilly, de Fosseux, de Vaurin, sir Bort\nGuieret and his brothers, the lord of Inchy, the lord of Raisse, the\nlord de Brimeu, sir Regnault de Crequy lord of Comtes[14], Enguerrand\nde Bournouville, the lord de Ront, sir Raoul de Flandres, the lord de\nPoix, sir Wincart de Bours, the lord d\u2019Auxy, the lord de Mailly, the\nlord de Thiennes and the lord d\u2019Azincourt. From Flanders, sir John and\nsir Louis de Guystelle, the lord de Hames, sir John de Bailleul, sir\nCollart de Fosseux, and others, the principal nobles of the country.\n\nIn like manner, duke William had assembled his nobles, with many\nothers, his allies; among whom was sir John de Bethune, brother to the\nviscount de Meaux. Common report said, that Anthony duke of Brabant,\nbrother to the duke of Burgundy, and Waleran de Luxembourg count\nde St Pol, had refused their assistance, because they had not been\nmade acquainted with the terms and agreements entered into by John\nof Bavaria on the one part, and the lord de Pier-Yves on the other,\nfor the resignation of the bishoprick of Liege. They also made other\nexcuses.\n\nWhen the day appointed for the meeting of the duke of Burgundy, duke\nWilliam and the bishop of Liege, in the town of Tournay, for the final\nsettlement of the affairs of Liege drew near, the inhabitants of\nthat town sent them a petition, by ambassadors chosen from among the\nprincipal citizens, to request they would fix on some other town, as\nthe numbers of their attendants would greatly harrass and impoverish\nthem, considering the very small stock of provision that was in\nTournay. Their request was granted,--and the town of Lille was chosen\nfor their meeting on the day that had before been fixed on.\n\nThither all the hostages from Liege were conducted, and brought into\nthe presence of the aforesaid dukes and bishop, with several more that\nhad been deputed to hear what judgment should be given, which was as\nfollows:\n\n\u2018The dukes of Burgundy and Holland declare, that this their judgment\nshall be punctually fulfilled in every respect, with regard to the\npresent time, reserving to themselves the power of making any future\nalterations in it as often as, and in what manner, they shall please.\n\n\u2018First, They consent that the inhabitants of Liege, of the towns and\ncountry of that bishoprick, situated within the district of Liege,\nthe country of Los, the countries of Hasbane, St Tron, the territory\nof Bouillon, shall enjoy their customary franchises and privileges.\nThey order, that the citizens of Liege, and of the other towns above\nnamed, do bring to the monastery des Escolliers, in the town of Mons\nin Hainault, on the morrow of Martinmas-day next ensuing, all the\nletters patent and charters of their laws and privileges, which they\npossess,--which they will deliver into the hands of such as may be\ncommissioned by the said dukes to receive them. Those who bring them\nshall make oath, on the salvation of their own souls, and of the souls\nof them who sent them, that they have not fraudulently left behind any\ncharters of their laws and privileges.\n\n\u2018Item, the dukes aforesaid declare, that should the city of Liege, or\nany other town, neglect to send, or fraudulently retain, any of their\ncharters, that town so retaining them shall be for ever deprived of its\nprivileges and particular laws.\n\n\u2018Item, the lords aforesaid will, that these charters and letters\npatent be delivered to the commissioners punctually on the morrow of\nMartinmas-day.\n\n\u2018Item, they likewise ordain, that when these charters and privileges\nshall have been duly examined, and new ones drawn up and delivered,\nneither the bishop of Liege nor his chapter shall grant any new\nprivileges to the inhabitants, without the consent of the two dukes or\ntheir successors.\n\n\u2018Item, they also ordain, that henceforward the commonalty shall not\nappoint or nominate, in the aforesaid towns and bishoprick, any\nofficers, such as governors, masters of trades, doctors of arts,--but\nthat from this day all such offices be annulled.\n\n\u2018Item, they ordain, that all bailiffs, provosts, mayors, and others\nbearing similar titles, shall be nominated by the bishop of Liege\nand the count de Los;--and also, that the sheriffs in such towns as\nclaim the right of shrievalty shall be renewed yearly, and a certain\nnumber appointed according to the exigency of the case and size of the\ntowns. In no large town shall father and son, two brothers-in-law, two\ncousins-german, the uncle and nephew, nor anyone who has married the\nmother of another, be appointed sheriffs at the same time, in order\nthat no improper favours be shewn from partiality of kindred. All\nofficers shall swear solemnly on their creation, to preserve and abide\nby every article and point contained in the constitution delivered to\nthem.\n\n\u2018Item, they ordain, that the bishop of Liege may, each year, at the\nexpiration of the shrievalty, appoint such sheriffs as he shall please,\nor re-appoint those of the preceding year, or others according to his\ngood pleasure, provided they are not any way connected by blood, as\nhas been before mentioned. All disputes respecting the persons or\nfortunes of the inhabitants of the different towns having sheriffs,\nshall be brought before their jurisdictions,--and at the end of the\nyear, the sheriffs shall be bound to render an account of their\nadministration before their lord, the bishop of Liege, or his deputies,\nand before one commissary deputed by the chapter, and another on the\npart of the different churches.\n\n\u2018Item, they ordain, that all guilds and fraternities in the city of\nLiege, and in all the other towns, shall henceforth cease and be\nannulled; and that the banners of the above guilds in Liege shall be\ndelivered up to commissaries, on an appointed day that shall be made\nknown to them; and the banners of the other towns shall be brought\nby the inhabitants to a certain place on an appointed day, to the\ncommissioners named to receive them, and who shall do with them as they\nmay judge expedient.\n\n\u2018Item, they also ordain, that in the above city, and in the towns\nwithin the said bishoprick, no one shall be reputed a citizen unless\nhe shall have really resided within such town in which he shall claim\nhis right of citizenship. And all such rights of citizenship are for\nthe present annulled; for although there may be resident citizens in\nthe aforesaid towns, they cannot, in such right, claim any moveables by\nreason of inheritance, without the cognizance of the lords under whom\nsuch persons have lived, and in whose territory such inheritances are\nsituated.\n\n\u2018Item, they ordain, that from this moment, and in times to come, the\ntowns of Huy, Dinant, and others within the territory of Liege, the\ncountry of Los, the country of Hasbane, and all within the jurisdiction\nof Liege, shall no longer call together any assembly, or congregation\nof people, under pretence of holding councils or otherwise, without the\nconsent of their aforesaid bishop and lord, or of the chapter of Liege,\nshould the bishoprick at the time be vacant.\n\n\u2018Item, they ordain, that the bishop of Liege, or any others having the\ngovernment of the said territory and its dependancies, shall never bear\narms against the king or kings of France, their successors; nor against\nthe two said dukes, their successors in the said duchies and counties;\nnor against the count de Namur for the time being, or his successors;\nnor against any of the countries, of the aforesaid, except when ordered\nby the emperor, and only when the emperor shall be himself present:\nprovided, nevertheless, that the king of France and the above-mentioned\npersons do not invade the territories of the bishop and chapter of\nLiege.\n\n\u2018Item, they likewise ordain, that in perpetual remembrance of this\nvictory, and the conquest made over them by the above two dukes, they\nand their successors shall have a free passage, whenever they may\nchoose to cross the river Meuse, through all towns in the territory of\nLiege, fortified or not, and with a body of men at arms or with few\nattendants according to their pleasure,--provided they do not permit\nany of the inhabitants of the said towns, villages, or country through\nwhich they shall pass, to be any way molested by their men,--and\nprovisions shall be found them for their money, without demanding\nhigher prices for the articles than they are usually sold for.\n\n\u2018Item, they ordain, that the coin of the aforesaid dukes and their\nsuccessors shall have free currency throughout the territories and\ndependancies of the bishop and chapter of Liege.\n\n\u2018Item, they ordain, that a chapel shall be erected on the spot where\nthe last victory was gained, and funds allotted for the support of four\nchaplains and two priests; and the said chapels shall be furnished\nwith chasubles, chalices, and other ornaments for celebrating mass\nand such other divine services as shall be thought advisable for the\neternal welfare of the souls of those who were slain in that battle.\nThe nomination to the above benefices shall remain with the two dukes,\naccording to regulations which they shall hereafter make between\nthemselves,--the Liegeois only to be once at the expense of providing\nthis chapel with sacred vessels and ornaments. The bishop of Liege\nshall allot from his revenues two hundred golden crowns of annual rent\nfor the support of the four chaplains and two priests; that is to say,\nfor each chaplain forty crowns, for each priest ten crowns, and for the\nrepairs of the chapel twenty crowns.\n\n\u2018Item, the said dukes will, that on the twenty-third day of every month\nof September, on which day the battle took place, a mass shall be\ncelebrated to the blessed Virgin, with great solemnity, by the provost\nor dean of the church of St Lambert, in Liege, who shall chaunt it in\nthe choir and at the grand altar, in commemoration of this victory,\nand for the welfare of the souls of those who fell in battle. The same\nshall be required of all the churches and chapels to monasteries, as\nwell for men as women, within the said town of Liege, as of all others\nwithin its jurisdiction.\n\n\u2018Item, the said dukes require from the bishop of Liege and the chapter,\nthat they strictly enjoin such services to be regularly performed on\nevery twenty-third day of September throughout the diocese; and that\nall priests, after the performing of this service, shall be suffered\npeaceably to return to their homes.\n\n\u2018Item, they ordain, that the bishop of Liege and his successors, and\nsuch as may have the government of the country in times of a vacancy\nin the see, and the members of the chapter of Liege, shall appoint\nsuch governor of the castle of Huy as they shall approve of: in which\ncastle, likewise, they shall not place a greater garrison, nor more\nstores of provision, than they shall judge expedient, like as an\nupright lord shall determine. They also insist on having a free ingress\nand regress into and from the town of Huy and the adjacent country.\nThey likewise ordain the same regulations respecting the castles of\nEscoquehen[15] and Bouillon, as to their governors, garrisons and\nstores.\n\n\u2018Item, the aforesaid dukes ordain, that should any one, however\nhigh his rank, attempt, by force, or otherwise, to deprive those of\nsuch gifts and preferments in the church, or any other offices for\nlife, as have been usually granted by the bishops of Liege and their\npredecessors, the members of the chapter of Liege shall be bound to\nrestore, and defend them in, their possessions to the utmost of their\npower, without any fraud whatever.\n\n\u2018Item, as there are still living many perverse conspirators, who are\nnow fugitives from the territories of Liege and county of Los, and\nhave retired into the neighbouring countries, where they have been\nreceived, the dukes aforesaid will appoint proper commissioners to\nmake inquiry whither such wicked persons have gone, and publish their\nnames. On the discovery of the places to which they have withdrawn,\napplications shall be made to the princes and lords thereof, that they\nmay be surrendered to the bishop of Liege, for him to inflict on them\nthe punishments due to their deserts, or at least that such princes\nand lords may drive them out of their respective countries. But should\nthese lords refuse to comply, or to do justice on such conspirators,\nthey shall be for ever banished from the bishoprick of Liege, the\ncounty of Los, and their dependancies, as conspirators and movers of\nsedition; and it shall be proclaimed throughout the above countries,\nthat no one receive them within their houses, but deliver them up\nto justice, should any attempt to return, demanding assistance from\ntheir lord, should there be a necessity for it. Should they be unable\nto arrest them, they shall denounce them to the nearest officers of\njustice, under pain of suffering corporal punishment, and having their\nfortunes confiscated, as would have been done to such conspirators\nand rebels. While exerting themselves in the performance of this\nduty, should they accidentally put to death any of such rebels, no\nconsequences shall ensue to their loss.\n\n\u2018Item, they ordain that the walls of the castle of Thuin, with its\ngates and towers, be razed, as well the part toward the town as that\ntoward the mountain, and the ditches filled up.\n\n\u2018Item, the same to be done to the town of Fosse and to the town\nand castle of Commun,--which towns shall not be repaired. And in\nlike manner shall all the posts on the river Sambre be destroyed,\nthe ditches filled, and neither they nor the towns shall be ever\nagain repaired, so that they may serve for places of defence to the\ninhabitants, on any pretence, in future times.\n\n\u2018Item, the gates, walls and towers of Dinant shall be pulled down, as\nwell on the opposite side of the Meuse as on this; and the inhabitants\nshall never rebuild them again.\n\n\u2018Item, the inhabitants of the said towns of Thuin, Fosse, Commun and\nDinant, or any persons from other towns, shall not rebuild or repair\nthe fortified places between or on the two rivers Sambre and Meuse, on\nthe road to Namur.\n\n\u2018Item, one of the gates of Tongres shall also be razed, namely, that\nwhich leads to Maestricht, with forty feet of wall on each side of the\nsaid gate, without a possibility of its ever being re-erected. The town\nof Tongres shall likewise, at its own expense, cause to be filled up\nthe trenches they had opened before the said town, when they besieged\ntheir lord within it, because they had put the country of Liege under\nheavy taxes, and had subjugated it.\n\n\u2018And whereas it is notorious, that very great losses have attended this\nsubjugation, the aforesaid dukes will, that an aid be levied on this\ncity, and the towns before mentioned, to the amount of two hundred and\ntwenty thousand golden crowns, which shall be raised as soon as may be,\nbeing levied in proportion to the comparative riches of each inhabitant.\n\n\u2018Item, in case any of the hostages shall die before all the articles\nof this treaty are completed, the aforesaid lords will, that the town\nor district whence such hostage or hostages shall have been sent, do\ninstantly furnish others of the same rank and property as those who\nhave died.\n\n\u2018Item, they ordain, that when this treaty shall be properly engrossed,\nthe bishop of Liege, his chapter, and the principal inhabitants, shall\ncome to sign it, and engage, that should any articles of it be not\ncompleted according to the exact tenor of the terms, then for each\nomission or neglect the bishop, his successors, the chapter and chief\ntowns shall forfeit two hundred thousand golden crowns of the coin of\nthe king of France, or other florins of gold of France, of the value\nof the aforesaid crowns. That is to say, fifty thousand to the then\nemperor or king of the Romans; to the king of France fifty thousand;\nand to each of the said dukes the like sum;--the whole to be levied on\nthe lands and moveables of the said Liegeois, by seizure of their goods\nand bodies wherever they may be.\n\n\u2018They are likewise to signify their consent, that should obstacles be\nthrown in the way by any of the said towns to prevent the articles\nof the said treaty from being carried into effect, the bishop of\nLiege, and the archbishop of Cologne for the time being, shall be the\narbitrators between such towns,--and their decision shall be final.\n\n\u2018When a legal pope shall be elected, and his authority over the whole\nchurch of God be acknowledged, then such as make opposition to the\nexecution of the above treaty shall be laid under an interdict, which\nshall not be taken off, until sufficient reparation be made, and the\naforesaid pecuniary forfeitures be paid.\n\n\u2018Should any of the towns, or their inhabitants, offer any insult, in\ncontradiction to the above treaty, to either of the said dukes or\ntheir successors, the bishop of Liege, or his vicar in his absence,\nthe chapter and citizens shall be required to constrain the offenders\nto make full reparation within one month from the time of complaint\nbeing made. And should such reparation not be made within the month,\nas aforesaid, after the summons to that effect has been delivered, the\ncountry shall be liable to the same fines as before mentioned.\n\n\u2018The dukes of Burgundy and of Holland order, that all these articles be\nfairly engrossed, and then sealed with their seals, and then given to\nthe lord bishop of Liege, or to his chapter, with a copy for the city\nof Liege and one for each principal town. In return, the bishop and the\ntowns shall give to the dukes aforesaid letters signed with their great\nseals acknowledging the receipt of the above treaty, and promising\nobedience to all the articles of it, and binding themselves to the\nfines therein mentioned.\n\n\u2018As many noble persons and others, as well secular as ecclesiastic,\nhave presented many petitions to complain of the great losses they have\nsuffered during the late rebellion, and specifying their particular\ngrievances,--the dukes aforesaid, not having had time to examine them\nwith the attention they deserve, will have them examined with all\npossible speed, and will attend to each of them.\u2019\n\nThe whole of the above, having been written out fair, was, by the\ncommand of the two dukes aforesaid, publicly proclaimed in the great\nhall at Lille, and in their presence, the 24th day of October, in the\nyear 1408.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. IV.\n\n    THE KING OF FRANCE HOLDS A GRAND COUNCIL AT PARIS, TO CONSIDER\n    ON THE MANNER OF PROCEEDING AGAINST THE DUKE OF BURGUNDY FOR\n    THE MURDER OF THE DUKE OF ORLEANS.\n\n\nDuring the expedition of the duke of Burgundy against the Liegeois, a\ngreat many of the principal lords were, by the king\u2019s orders, assembled\nat Paris. Among them were, Louis king of Sicily, Charles king of\nNavarre, the duke of Brittany, the duke of Bourbon, and several others,\nthe greater part of whom were friendly to the duchess-dowager of\nOrleans and her children in their prosecution of the duke of Burgundy.\nMany councils were held as to the manner in which the king should\nproceed against the duke of Burgundy, who was the principal actor in\nthis murder, as has been before explained.\n\nIt was at length determined in these councils, that a most rigorous\nprosecution, in conformity to the laws, should be carried on against\nhim; and should he refuse to obey, the king, with all his subjects\nand vassals, should march, with as great a force as could be raised,\nagainst him, to bring him and his abettors to due obedience.\n\nAt the same time, at the solicitations of the duchess of Orleans\nand her children, the king annulled all his letters of pardon which\nhe had formerly granted to the duke of Burgundy, and declared them\nof no weight, in the presence of the queen, the duke of Acquitaine,\nthe princes of the blood, and the whole of the council. The duchess\ndemanded and obtained letters, confirming this renunciation of the\npardon; after which, she and her daughter-in-law, wife to the young\nduke of Orleans, left Paris, and returned to Blois.\n\nNot long after this, news came to Paris of the great victory which\nthe duke of Burgundy had gained over the Liegeois. This was confirmed\nby the return of the king\u2019s ambassadors, sir Guichard Daulphin and\nsir William de Tignonville, who, as has been related, were present at\nthe battle, and gave to the king and the lords then in Paris a most\ncircumstantial account of it. On hearing this, several who had been\nmost violent against the duke of Burgundy, now hung their heads, and\nbegan to be of a contrary opinion to what they had before held, fearing\nthe steadiness, boldness and power of the duke, who was said to have a\nmind equal to the support of any misfortunes that should happen to him,\nand which would encourage him to oppose and conquer all attempts of his\nadversaries. In short, all the measures that had been adopted against\nhim were dropped, and the men at arms were ordered to return to the\nplaces whence they had come.\n\nAmbassadors had arrived from England to treat of a peace, or a truce\nfor one year, between the kings of England and of France, which having\nobtained, they set out on their return, through Amiens and Boulogne,\nto Calais. On the road, they heard of the grand victory of the duke\nof Burgundy, which surprised them very much,--and they gave him the\nsurname of \u2018Jean sans peur.\u2019\n\nThe duke of Burgundy was very active in attaching to his party noblemen\nand warriors from all countries, to strengthen himself against his\nenemies, of whom he was given to understand that he had many. He\nheld on this subject several consultations with his two brothers and\nbrothers-in-law, namely, duke William of Holland and John of Bavaria,\nto which were admitted his most trusty friends; and they deliberated\nlong on the manner in which he should now carry himself. It was at\nlength finally concluded, that he should openly oppose all, excepting\nthe king of France and the duke of Acquitaine; and those present\npromised him aid and support with all the power of their vassals, on\nthese terms.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. V.\n\n    THE KING OF FRANCE IS CARRIED, BY THE PRINCES OF THE BLOOD,\n    TO TOURS IN TOURAINE.----PEACE IS MADE IN THE TOWN OF\n    CHARTRES.--THE DEATH OF THE DOWAGER DUCHESS OF ORLEANS.\n\n\nThe king of France left Paris, accompanied by the kings of Sicily and\nNavarre, the queen, the duke of Acquitaine, the dukes of Berry and\nBourbon, who, with others of the blood-royal, conducted him, under\nthe escort of a large body of men at arms, to Tours in Touraine, as\nhis place of residence,--to the great displeasure of the inhabitants\nof Paris, who were so much troubled thereat that they barricadoed the\nstreets with chains. They hastily sent to inform the duke of Burgundy,\nat Lille, of the king\u2019s departure, giving him to understand that the\ngreater part of those who had carried him away from Paris were not well\ninclined towards him.\n\nThis intelligence was not very agreeable to the duke, for he suspected\nthat the king had only been conducted to Tours that his enemies might\ncarry their measures against him more securely; for the lords who had\nthe government knew well that the Parisians loved the duke of Burgundy,\nand would not that any other should have the government of the kingdom,\nbelieving, from the hints he had thrown out, that when in power he\nwould abolish all gabelles and other taxes which oppressed the people.\n\nThe duke of Burgundy first consulted the dukes of Brabant and of\nHolland, and other steady friends, and then remanded his men at arms\nfrom Burgundy, who were on their march to their own country from Liege,\nand assembled another body from various parts. He advanced to Roye, in\nthe Vermandois, where he mustered his men, and then marched them toward\nParis. He quartered himself, on the 23d day of November, in the town of\nSt Denis, and his forces in the adjacent country. On the morrow, as he\nwas advancing with his men at arms in array toward Paris, two thousand\nor more combatants sallied out thence, and conducted him, with every\nmark of honour, to his h\u00f4tel of Artois.\n\nMany of the Parisians sung carols in the squares, although all\nrejoicings had been strictly forbidden on his arrival, to avoid\nincreasing the envy of the princes of the blood. Some of the king\u2019s\nservants said to those who were singing carols, \u2018You may otherwise\nshow your joy for his arrival, but you ought not thus to sing.\u2019\nNotwithstanding this, all the principal citizens, and those in\nauthority, showed him as much honour and respect as if he had been king\nhimself.\n\nA few days afterward, duke William, count of Hainault, arrived at\nParis, well accompanied by unarmed men, and, at the request of the\nduke of Burgundy, set out for Tours, attended by the lords de Croy,\nde St George, de la Viefville, d\u2019Olhaz, and others of the council of\nthe duke, to negotiate his peace with the king, and the lords who had\ncarried him from Paris. The count of Hainault was most honourably\nreceived at Tours by the king, the queen, and the other great lords;\nfor the marriage had taken place between John duke of Touraine, second\nson to the king, and the daughter of the duke of Burgundy: he was also\nnearly related to the queen.\n\nOn the conclusion of the feasts made on his arrival, the count of\nHainault and those who had accompanied him opened, in full council,\nthe business of their mission, namely, to make peace for the duke\nof Burgundy. After many discussions, it was resolved, that the king\nshould send certain persons, selected by him, to hold a conference with\nthe duke of Burgundy at Paris, and point out to him the means of his\nregaining the good graces of the king.\n\nDuke Louis of Bavaria, brother to the queen, Montagu grand master of\nthe king\u2019s household, and other experienced counsellors, were nominated\nfor this purpose; and they returned with the count de Hainault to\nParis, when what had passed was told to the duke of Burgundy.\n\nAs all the circumstances of this treaty were not agreeable to the duke,\nand as he had many suspicions respecting Montagu, he was not disposed\nto receive the negotiators in the way they were sent to him. He even\npersonally made many reproaches to Montagu, who bore them patiently,\nexcusing himself for any thing that had passed. The treaty, however,\nhaving been altered and corrected, was sent back to the king at Tours,\nand in the end agreed to in the manner you shall hear.\n\nWhile these negotiations were going forward, and before their\nconclusion, the duchess-dowager of Orleans, daughter to Galeazzo duke\nof Milan, died in the town of Blois, broken-hearted at not having been\nable to obtain justice from the king and council against the duke of\nBurgundy for the murder of her late lord and husband, Louis duke of\nOrleans. The duke of Burgundy was much rejoiced at this event, for the\nduchess had bitterly carried on her prosecution against him.\n\nHer heart was buried at Paris, near that of her husband, and her body\nin the church of the canons at Blois. After her death, Charles, her\neldest son, was duke of Orleans and of Valois, count of Blois and of\nBeaumont, lord of Coni and of Ast, with many other lordships:--Philip,\nthe second son, was count of Vertus,--and John, the youngest, was named\ncount of Angoul\u00eame. These three brothers, and one sister, thus became\norphans, but they had been very well educated; yet, by the deaths of\nthe duke and duchess of Orleans, they were much weakened in support\nand advice,--and several of the king\u2019s ministers were not so zealous\nto prosecute the duke of Burgundy as they had been. This was very\napparent in the negotiations which took place some little time after\nthe death of the duchess, between the duke of Burgundy and the children\nof Orleans; for although the treaty sent by the king was not wholly to\nthe liking of the duke, as has been said, yet it was so corrected that\nthe parties accepted of it, in the following terms:\n\nFirst, it was ordered by the king and his great council, that the duke\nof Burgundy should depart from Paris with his men at arms, and return\nto his own country, where he was to remain until a certain day, namely,\nthe first Wednesday in February, when he was to meet the king at the\ntown of Chartres, accompanied only by one hundred gentlemen at arms,\nand the children of Orleans with fifty. It was also ordered, that duke\nWilliam, count of Hainault, should have under his command four hundred\nof the king\u2019s men at arms, to preserve the peace. It was also ordered,\nthat the duke of Burgundy, when he appeared before the king, should be\nattended by one of his council, who should repeat the words he was to\nsay; and the duke, in confirmation of them, was to add, \u2018We will and\nagree that it should be thus.\u2019\n\nAfterward, according to the tenor of the treaty, the king was to say to\nthe duke of Burgundy, \u2018We will, that the count de Vertus, our nephew,\nhave one of your daughters in marriage.\u2019 The duke was by this treaty to\nassign over to his daughter three thousand livres parisis yearly, and\ngive her one hundred and fifty thousand golden francs.\n\nWhen this treaty had been concluded, duke William set out from Paris\nfor Hainault; and shortly after, the duke of Burgundy disbanded his men\nat arms, and left Paris to go to Lille, whither he had summoned the\nduke of Brabant his brother, duke William and the bishop of Liege, his\nbrothers-in-law, and many other great lords.\n\nAt this period, there was a great quarrel between the duke of Brabant\nand duke William. It was caused by the father of duke William having\nborrowed in former times from the late duchess of Brabant one hundred\nand fifty thousand florins to carry on a war against some of his\nrebellious subjects in Holland, which sum the duke of Brabant had\nclaimed as belonging to him. He had in consequence, by the advice\nof his Brabanters, taken possession of a castle called Heusden[16],\nsituated between Brabant and Holland.\n\nThe duke of Burgundy took great pains to make up the quarrel between\nthese two princes, that they might the more effectually assist him in\nhis plans, which were very extensive. After this business had been\nsettled, and the parties had separated, duke William assembled in\nHainault, according to the king of France\u2019s orders, four hundred men\nat arms and as many archers. The principal lords among them were, the\ncounts de Namur, de Conversant and de Salmes. The duke of Burgundy,\nconformably to the treaty, set out, the day after Ash-Wednesday,\nattended by his son-in-law the count de Penthievre[17], and lay at\nBapaume. Thence he went to Paris, with duke William, the above-named\nlords, the count de St Pol, the count de Vaudemont[18], and several\nothers of the nobility.\n\nOn Saturday, the 2d day of March, they arrived all together at the\ntown of Gallardon, four leagues distant from Chartres. The Wednesday\nfollowing, duke William of Holland advanced with his body of forces to\nChartres, where the king then was. On the ensuing Saturday, the duke\nof Burgundy set out from Gallardon, to wait on the king, escorted by\nsix hundred men at arms; but when he approached Chartres, he dismissed\nthem all, excepting one hundred light horsemen, in compliance with the\ntreaty, and thus entered Chartres about ten o\u2019clock in the morning,\nriding strait to the church as far as the cloisters of the canons,\nwhere he was lodged.\n\nAt this same time, the duke of Orleans, in company with his brother the\ncount de Vertus, and, according to the treaty, attended by only fifty\nmen at arms, entered the church of our Lady at Chartres, with the king\ntheir uncle, the queen, the duke of Acquitaine, and several princes of\nthe blood.\n\nThat the king and lords might not be pressed upon by the spectators,\nand that all might plainly see the ceremony, a scaffolding was erected\nin the church, on which the king was seated near the crucifix. Round\nhim were placed the queen, the dauphin and dauphiness, daughter to the\nduke of Burgundy, the kings of Sicily and Navarre, the dukes of Berry\nand Bourbon; the cardinal de Bar, the marquis du Pont his brother, the\narchbishop of Sens, and the bishop of Chartres, with other counts,\nprelates, and the family of Orleans were behind the king. At the\nentrance of the church, by the king\u2019s orders, were a body of men at\narms drawn up in battle-array.\n\nIt was not long before the duke of Burgundy entered the church, and on\nhis advancing toward the king, all the lords, excepting the king, queen\nand dauphin, rose up from their seats. The duke, on his approach to the\nking, kneeled down with his advocate the lord d\u2019Ollehaing, who repeated\nto the king the following words:\n\n\u2018Sire, behold here my lord of Burgundy, your subject and cousin, who\nis thus come before you, because he has heard you are angry with him,\nfor the action he has committed against the person of the late duke of\nOrleans your brother, for the good of yourself and your kingdom,--the\ntruth of which he is ready to declare and prove to you, whenever you\nshall please. My lord, therefore, entreats of you, in the most humble\nmanner possible, that you would be pleased to withdraw from him your\nanger, and restore him to your good graces.\u2019 When the lord d\u2019Ollehaing\nhad said this, the duke of Burgundy himself addressed the king, saying,\n\u2018Sire, I entreat this of you:\u2019--when instantly the duke of Berry,\nseeing the king made no reply, bade the duke of Burgundy retire some\npaces behind,--which being done, the duke of Berry, kneeling before\nthe king, said something to him in a low voice,--and immediately the\ndauphin, the kings of Sicily and Navarre, with the duke of Berry, knelt\ndown to the king, and said, \u2018Sire, we supplicate that you would be\npleased to listen to the prayer of your cousin the duke of Burgundy.\u2019\nThe king answered them, \u2018We will that it be so,--and we grant it from\nour love to you.\u2019\n\nThe duke of Burgundy then approached the king, who said to him,--\u2018Fair\ncousin, we grant your request, and pardon you fully for what you have\ndone.\u2019 After this, he advanced, with the lord d\u2019Ollehaing, toward the\nchildren of Orleans, who, as I have said, were behind the king weeping\nmuch.\n\nThe lord d\u2019Ollehaing addressed them, saying, \u2018My lords, behold the\nduke of Burgundy, who entreats of you to withdraw from your hearts\nwhatever hatred or revenge you may harbour within them, for the act\nperpetrated against the person of my lord of Orleans, your father, and\nthat henceforward ye may remain good friends.\u2019 The duke of Burgundy\nthen added, \u2018And I beg this of you.\u2019 No answer being made, the king\ncommanded them to accede to the request of his fair cousin the duke\nof Burgundy. Upon which they replied, \u2018Sire, since you are pleased to\ncommand us, we grant him his request, and shall extinguish all the\nhatred we bore him; for we should be sorry to disobey you in any thing\nthat may give you pleasure.\u2019\n\nThe cardinal de Bar then, by the king\u2019s orders, brought an open Bible,\non which the two parties, namely, the two sons of the late duke of\nOrleans and the duke of Burgundy swore on the holy evangelists,\ntouching them with their hands, that they would mutually preserve a\nfirm peace towards each other, without any open or secret attempts\ncontrary to the full meaning of their oaths. When this was done, the\nking said, \u2018We will that henceforth ye be good friends; and I most\nstrictly enjoin, that neither of you attempt any thing to the loss or\nhurt of the other, nor against any persons who are attached to you,\nor who may have given you advice or assistance; and that you show\nno hatred against any one on this occasion, under pain of offending\nagainst our royal authority,--excepting, however, those who actually\ncommitted this murder, who shall be for ever banished from our kingdom.\u2019\n\nAfter this speech of the king, these princes again swore they would\nfaithfully abide by their treaty. The duke of Burgundy then advanced\nto salute the wife of the dauphin, the duke of Acquitaine; and about\nan hour after this ceremony had taken place the duke took his leave\nof the king, queen, and the lords present, and set out from Chartres\nfor Gallardon, where he dined. Many who were there were very much\nrejoiced that matters had gone off so well; but others were displeased,\nand murmured, saying, that henceforward it would be no great offence\nto murder a prince of the blood, since those who had done so were so\neasily acquitted, without making any reparation, or even begging pardon.\n\nThe duke of Orleans and his brother shortly after took leave of the\nking, queen, dauphin, and the lords of the court, and returned, with\ntheir attendants, to Blois, whence they had come, not well satisfied,\nany more than their council, with the peace that had been made.\n\nThe marquis du Pont, son to the duke of Bar, and cousin to the duke of\nBurgundy, who before this day was not beloved by him, on account of\nthe murder of the duke of Orleans, followed him to Gallardon, where\nthey dined publicly together in great friendship and concord. About two\no\u2019clock in the afternoon duke William, the count de St Pol, and other\ngreat lords, visited the duke of Burgundy at his lodgings in Gallardon,\nand then returned together toward Paris.\n\nThe king, the queen, the dauphin, and the other kings, princes and\ncardinals, arrived at Paris on Mid-Lent Sunday; and the dukes of\nBurgundy and of Holland, with the cardinal de Bordeaux, who was at that\ntime in Paris, on his way to the council of Pisa, went out to meet\nthem, followed by upwards of two hundred thousand Parisians of both\nsexes, eager to receive the king, singing carols, as he entered the\ngates, and conducting him with great rejoicings to his palace.\n\nThey were very happy that the king was returned to Paris, and also that\na peace had been concluded respecting the death of the late duke of\nOrleans. They attributed the whole to the great mercy of God, who had\npermitted that such strong symptoms of a civil war should be so readily\nextinguished; but they did not foresee or consider the consequences\nthat ensued.\n\nThe greater part of the Parisians were obstinately attached to the\nduke of Burgundy, through the hope that by his means all the most\noppressive taxes would be abolished; but they did not see clearly all\nthe mischiefs that afterward befel the kingdom and themselves,--for in\na very short time, as you shall hear, a most cruel contention broke out\nbetween the families of Orleans and Burgundy.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. VI.\n\n    THE QUEEN OF SPAIN DIES DURING THE SITTING OF THE COUNCIL AT\n    PISA.--THE MARRIAGE OF THE KING OF DENMARK, NORWAY AND SWEDEN.\n\n\nIn this year died the queen of Spain[19], sister to Henry king of\nEngland, and mother to the young king of Spain and queen of Portugal.\nThe Spaniards after her death sent home all the english servants, male\nand female, belonging to the late queen, who returned to England in\nmuch grief and sorrow at heart.\n\nAt this same season, great numbers of prelates, archbishops, bishops\nand abbots, set out from various countries of Christendom to attend the\ncouncil at Pisa which was assembling to restore union to the church,\nwhich had for a long time suffered a schism, to the great displeasure\nof many princes and well-inclined persons.\n\nAbout this same period, Henry[20] king of Denmark, Norway and Sweden,\ntook to wife the daughter of Henry king of England. These kingdoms were\nput into the hands of the king of Denmark by their queen, who divested\nherself of all power and profit over them in favour of king Henry.\n\n\n\n\n[A. D. 1409.]\n\nCHAP. VII.\n\n    THE KING OF FRANCE HAS A SEVERE RETURN OF HIS DISORDER.--THE\n    MARRIAGE OF THE COUNT DE NEVERS WITH THE DAMSEL OF COUCY.--THE\n    WAR OF AM\u00c9 DE VIRY, A SAVOYARD, WITH THE DUKE OF BOURBON.\n\n\nAt the beginning of this year, Charles king of France was much\noppressed with his usual disorder. On this account, when the kings of\nNavarre and Sicily, and the duke of Berry, had properly provided, in\nconjunction with the duke of Burgundy, for the state of the king, and\nthe government of the realm, they went to visit their own territories.\nIn like manner, the duke of Burgundy, went to the marriage of his\nbrother Philip count of Nevers, who took to wife the damsel of Coucy,\ndaughter to sir Enguerrand de Coucy[21], formerly lord and count of\nSoissons, and niece by the mother\u2019s side to the duke of Lorraine and to\nthe count de Vaudemont; which marriage was celebrated in the town of\nSoissons.\n\nThis ceremony was performed on Saint George\u2019s day, and the feasts and\nentertainments lasted for three days afterward. There were present the\nduchess of Lorraine[22] and the countess of Vaudemont[23], who had come\nexpressly thither to do honour to the lady of Coucy and her daughter.\n\nWhen these feasts were over, the duke of Burgundy, attended by his\nson-in-law the count de Penthievre, set out for Burgundy; and shortly\nafter, the count de Nevers conducted his wife, and the duchess of\nLorraine and the countess of Vaudemont, to his county of Rethel, where\nshe was received with every token of joy.\n\nDuring this time, the duke of Bourbon was challenged by Am\u00e9 de Viry,\na Savoyard, and a poor blade in comparison with the duke of Bourbon;\nnevertheless, he committed much damage by fire and sword in the\ncountries of Bresse and Beaujolois. The duke was very indignant at\nthis, and assembled a large body of men at arms and archers to punish\nand conquer him. He ordered his son, the count de Clermont, to lead on\nthe van, and he speedily followed in person.\n\nIn his company were the counts de la Marche and de Vend\u00f4me, the lord\nd\u2019Albret, constable of France, Louis de Baviere, brother to the queen,\nMontagu, grand master of the king\u2019s household, the lord de la Heuse and\nmany more great lords, who advanced with a numerous body of men to the\ncounty of Beaujolois.\n\nAm\u00e9 de Viry was informed of the great force which the duke of Bourbon\nwas marching against him, and dared not wait his arrival; for he had\nnot strength enough to garrison the forts he had taken. On his retreat,\nhe marched to a town called Bourg-en-Bresse, which belonged to the earl\nof Savoy, his lord. The earl, however, would not support him against\nhis great uncle, the duke of Bourbon, but gave him up, on condition\nthat Am\u00e9 should make every amends in his power for the mischiefs he had\ndone, and should surrender himself to one of the prisons of the duke,\nuntil he should have completely made him satisfaction, but that no harm\nof any sort should be done to his person.\n\nThe duke of Bourbon gladly received him, and thanked his nephew for his\nfriendship.--This caused a quarrel of some standing to be made up; for\nthe earl of Savoy had declared his great uncle owed him homage for his\nlands of Beaujolois, which he would not pay,--but now the dispute was\nmutually referred by them to the duke of Berry.\n\nWhen these matters were concluded, the duke of Bourbon returned to\nFrance, and disbanded his forces. Some time after, by means which Viry\nmade use of with the duke, he obtained his liberty. Waleran count de\nSt Pol intended being of this expedition with the duke of Bourbon, and\nraised a large force; but on marching near Paris, he was ordered not to\nproceed further, and to return to the frontiers of the Boulonois, where\nhe had been specially commissioned by the king.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. VIII.\n\n    TWO COMBATS TAKE PLACE AT PARIS IN THE PRESENCE OF THE\n    KING.----THE DEATH OF THE ARCHBISHOP OF RHEIMS.----THE COUNCIL\n    AT PISA.\n\n\nAbout Ascension-day, the king of France, who had been grievously ill,\nwas restored to health,--and in consequence, the dukes of Berry,\nBurgundy, and Bourbon, with many other lords, instantly returned to\nParis. Two combats were ordained to be fought in the square behind St\nMartin des Champs, in the presence of the king and the aforesaid lords.\nOne was between a breton knight, called sir William Batailler, and an\nEnglishman, named sir John Carmien, for a breach of faith.\n\nWhen they were met, and Montjoye king at arms had proclaimed their\nchallenges and the causes of them, in the accustomed manner, he bade\nthem do their duty. Sir William, who was the appellant, issued first\nout of his pavilion, and marched proudly toward his adversary, who was\nadvancing to meet him. They threw their lances without effect, and\nthen made use of their swords: but in this last combat the Englishman\nwas slightly wounded below his armour, when the king instantly put an\nend to the fight. They were both very honourably led out of the lists,\nand conducted to their lodgings.\n\nThe other combat was between the seneschal of Hainault and sir John\nCornwall, an english knight of great renown, and who had married a\nsister to the king of England[24]. This combat was undertaken by the\ntwo knights at the desire of the duke of Burgundy, when at Lille, to\nshow their prowess in running a few courses with the lance and giving\nsome strokes with the battle-axe: but when the duke had caused the\nlists to be prepared, the two champions were ordered by the king to\nrepair to Paris, and to perform their deeds of arms in his presence.\n\nAccording to these orders, and on the appointed day, sir John Cornwall\nentered the lists first, very grandly equipped, and, galloping his\nhorse around, came before the king, whom he gallantly saluted. He was\nfollowed by six little pages mounted on as many war-horses, the two\nfirst of which were covered with furniture of ermines, and the other\nfour with cloth of gold. When he had made his obeisances, the pages\nretired without the lists.\n\nShortly after, the seneschal arrived, attended by the duke of Brabant\nand his brother, the count de Nevers, each holding a rein of his horse,\non his right and left. The count de Clermont bore his battle-axe, and\nthe count de Penthievre his lance. When he had made the circuit of the\nlists, and had saluted the king, as sir John Cornwall had done, they\nprepared to tilt with their lances; but as they were on the point of so\ndoing, the king caused it to be proclaimed that they should not proceed\nin this matter, which was very displeasing to both of them, and forced\nthem to return to their h\u00f4tels.\n\nIt was again proclaimed, by the king\u2019s orders, that this deed of arms\nshould not be carried further,--and that in future no one, under pain\nof capital punishment, should, throughout his realm, challenge another\nto a duel without a substantial cause.\n\nWhen the king had magnificently feasted these two knights, and shown\nthem much honour at his court, they departed, as it was said, for\nEngland, with the intention of completing their deed of arms.\n\nDuring this time, the cardinal de Bar, son to the duke of Bar, and\nGuye de Roye, archbishop of Rheims, in company with master Peter\nd\u2019Ailly, bishop of Cambray, and several other prelates and churchmen,\nwere journeying to the general council which was to be held at Pisa,\nand took up their lodgings one night at a town called Voltri, on the\nsea-coast, about four leagues from Genoa. At this place the blacksmith\nof the archbishop had a quarrel with a blacksmith of the town, about\nthe price of shoeing a horse, which proceeded from words to blows, and\nthe archbishop\u2019s blacksmith killed the other, and fled instantly for\nsafety to the lodgings of his master.\n\nThe townsmen immediately rose,--and a great number of them came to\nrevenge the death of their countryman. The archbishop, hearing of the\ncause of this tumult, left his chamber, and kindly addressed them,\npromising to have the injury immediately repaired, according to their\nwishes; and, the more to appease them, he delivered up his blacksmith\ninto the hands of the magistrate of the place, who was a lieutenant of\nBoucicaut marshal of France, then governor of Genoa.\n\nBut this was of no avail,--for as the archbishop was speaking to them,\nwithout the door of his house, one of the mob thrust his javelin right\nthrough his body to the heart, so that he dropped down dead without\nuttering another word. It was a great pity, for he was a religious\nprelate, and of a noble family.\n\nThis deed, however, did not satisfy them; for instantly after they\nmurdered the magistrate and the aforesaid blacksmith, and also\nendeavoured to force their way into the house, whither the cardinal de\nBar and the greater part of the others had retired, in order to put\nthem likewise to death.\n\nThey were, however, at length appeased by the principal inhabitants,\nand it was concluded that the cardinal should grant them his pardon for\nwhat they had done against him,--to which, indeed, he was induced by\nhis attendants, from their fears of being all destroyed.\n\nThey never told him of the murder of the archbishop until he was gone\ntwo leagues from the town: on the hearing of it, he was so troubled,\nand sick at heart, that he was near falling off his mule. His\nattendants, notwithstanding, made him hasten his pace as much as they\ncould; for they were alarmed for their lives, after the instances they\nhad seen, and from the numbers of people they perceived descending\nthe hills, and the accustomed signs they saw when a town is under any\napprehension of danger, and the ringing of bells in the manner usual on\nthese occasions.\n\nThese signals were sounded throughout the country, and the peasants\nwere seen running down the hills to overtake them; but when they were\narrived within a league of Genoa, the marshal Boucicaut[25] came out\nwith a handsome company to meet him. The cardinal made loud complaints\nto him of the outrages that had been committed on his people at the\ntown of Voltri, and demanded that he would judicially inquire into it.\nThe marshal replied, that he would make so severe an example of that\ntown that all others should take warning from it.\n\nThe cardinal was then conducted into the city of Genoa, where he was\nmade welcome by the churchmen and other inhabitants; and this same\nday the body of the archbishop of Rheims was brought thither, and\nhonourably interred,--and his obsequies were performed in the principal\nchurch of Genoa.\n\nShortly after, the marshal Boucicaut punished most severely all whom\nhe could apprehend that had committed these outrages, with their\naccomplices: they were put to death in various ways, and their houses\nalso were razed to the ground, that these executions might serve for\nwarnings to others never to commit such cruel murders.\n\nThe cardinal de Bar, with his companions, now set out from Genoa, and\ntravelled, by easy day\u2019s journies, to Pisa, where were assembled a\nprodigious number of cardinals, doctors in theology, and graduates in\ncivil law and other sciences, ambassadors and prelates, in obedience\nto the two popes, from different kingdoms, and from all parts of\nChristendom.\n\nAfter many councils had been held on the schism in the church, they\ncame at last to this conclusion: they unanimously condemned the\ntwo rival popes as heretics, schismatics, obstinate in evil, and\nperturbators of the peace of our holy mother the church. This sentence\nwas passed in the presence of twenty-four cardinals, at the gates\nof Pisa, before all the people, the 15th day of June, in the year\naforesaid.\n\nThe same cardinals, after invoking the grace and assistance of the\nholy Spirit, entered into conclave, where they remained until the 16th\nday of the same month, when they finished their election. They chose\nPeter of Candia, so named from being a native of that island: he was\nof the order of Friars Minors, created a doctor in theology at Paris,\narchbishop of Milan and cardinal; and, when consecrated sovereign of\nthe true and holy catholic church, he took the name of Pope Alexander V.\n\nO, most powerful God! how great was the joy thus caused, through thy\nnever-failing grace; for it is impossible to relate the shoutings and\nacclamations that resounded for more than a league round the city of\nPisa. But what shall we say of the city of Paris? Why, when this joyful\nnews was brought thither, on the 8th of July, they incessantly shouted,\nnight and day, \u2018Long live Alexander V. our pope!\u2019 in all the squares\nand streets, and entertained all passengers with meat and drink, from\ntheir heartfelt happiness. When the ceremony of consecrating the pope\nwas over, letters were sent to different persons, the more fully to\nexplain the proceedings of the council. I shall insert the one written\nby the abbot of Saint Maixence to the bishop of Poitiers, the tenor of\nwhich was as follows.\n\n\u2018Reverend father, and my redoubted lord, after my humble respects being\naccepted, I know that your reverence would gladly be informed of the\nproceedings of the council, which has been held in the city of Pisa,\nand any intelligence concerning it; and it is for this reason I have\nindited the following lines to your reverence.\n\n\u2018First, then, on the 25th day of March all the cardinals, who had been\ncreated by both popes, and all the prelates then in Pisa, assembled\nin the church of St Martin, which is situated beyond the river, on the\nroad leading to Florence, and thence being dressed in their robes, with\nmitres on their heads, they made a grand procession to the cathedral\nchurch, which is as distant from that of Saint Martin as our church of\nN\u00f4tre Dame at Paris is from that of St Martin des Champs. There the\ncouncil always afterward assembled; and on this first day, mass was\ncelebrated with great solemnity: the sermon was preached by my lord\ncardinal of Milan, of the order of Friars Minors, a great theologian.\nWhen the service was over, the morrow was fixed on to open the council,\nand the two popes were summoned to attend on that day at the gates of\nthe church by two cardinals; but neither of them appeared, nor any one\nfor them.\n\n\u2018The council continued to sit till the latter end of March, when the\npopes were again summoned to appear, but neither of them obeyed. The\ncouncil therefore having required the two rival popes to come before\nthem, on account of the schism that has reigned in the church, and\nneither of them appearing, or sending any one to make satisfactory\nanswers for them, and the term allotted for their appearing being\nelapsed, declared them both guilty of the schism that distresses the\nchurch, and of contumacy, by their conduct, toward the council.\n\n\u2018The council ordered prosecutions to be carried on against both of the\npopes, on the Monday after Quasimodo-Sunday, the 15th of April, when\nmy lords cardinals celebrated together the service of the holy week.\nOn Good Friday, my lord cardinal d\u2019Orsini celebrated divine service in\nSaint Martin\u2019s church; and a secular doctor of divinity, from Bologna\nla Grassa, preached an excellent sermon.\n\n\u2018My lords cardinals were all present at the ceremonies of Easter\nSunday. During the ensuing week they assembled in council, sometimes\nalone, at others they called in the prelates, to deliberate on the\nstate of affairs, and what line of conduct should be pursued; and every\nthing was carried on with mutual good will on all sides. This week the\nambassadors from the king of the Romans arrived at Pisa.\n\n\u2018On the Sunday of Quasimodo, an italian bishop said mass before the\ncardinals; and a cordelier from Languedoc, a doctor in divinity\npreached the sermon, in which he greatly praised my lords cardinals\nfrom France, and such as were seeking to restore peace to the\nchurch,--but very harshly treated the two contending popes, calling\nthem schismatics, heretics, and traitorous enemies to God and to his\nchurch. He chose for his text, \u2018Jesus dixit, Pax vobis,\u2019 which he\nhandled extraordinarily well.\n\n\u2018The following Monday, the cardinals, prelates, ambassadors, and\nprocurators then present, made oath to obey the decisions of the\ncouncil. Mass was then chaunted, and succeeded by many prayers; then\nthe litany was sung, at which all the cardinals and prelates, dressed\nin their robes and mitres, attended, and so continued as long as the\nsittings of the council lasted, which made it a handsome sight to see.\n\n\u2018This same day, the council gave audience to the ambassadors from\nRobert king of the Romans; and the bishop of Verdun, on the part of\nRobert, who favoured pope Gregory as much as he could, began his\nharangue, taking for his theme, \u2018Pax vobis.\u2019 He made many mischievous\npropositions, to divide and distract the council, in obedience to\nhis master, and to serve the false pope Gregory. There were with\nthis bishop an archbishop of a foreign order, and a numerous body of\nattendants. When the bishop had made his propositions, the ambassadors\nwere required to deliver the same in writing, and to show their\nprocurations from their lord. A day was then fixed to hear the answer\nof the council to their propositions; but before this day arrived, the\nambassadors went away without taking leave of their host.\n\n\u2018This week of Quasimodo, the lord Malatesta came to Pisa in great\nstate: he had given to pope Gregory one of his castles called\nRimini[26], and made the following request to the cardinals assembled,\nas well on the part of pope Gregory as on his own,--namely, that it\nwould please the members of the council to adjourn its sittings, and\nchange the place of its meeting; that if they would so do, pope Gregory\nwould attend personally, provided the situation were in a place of\nsafety, and that he might have security for his coming to and going\nfrom it.\n\n\u2018In consequence of this request, the cardinals summoned the prelates to\nnotify it to them; but they unanimously declared, they would neither\nconsent that the place of holding the council should be changed nor\nthat the meetings of it should be adjourned. This answer was very\nagreeable to the cardinals. The lord Malatesta, therefore, returned\nwithout having succeeded in his object; but his anger was appeased by\nsome of the cardinals, his friends and acquaintance.\n\n\u2018From the 15th of April, the council continued sitting to the 23d\nof the said month,--when, after the solemnity of the mass, the\nadvocate-fiscal demanded, that the council should declare, that the\nconjunction of the two colleges of cardinals of the holy church of Rome\nhad been, and was, lawful and canonical at the time it was formed.\n\n\u2018Item, that it should declare, that this holy council is duly\ncanonical, by the cardinals of both colleges assembling for so\nexcellent a purpose.\n\n\u2018Item, that this holy council has been called together by the cardinals\nof both colleges with a good intent.\n\n\u2018Item, that it has been assembled at a convenient opportunity.\n\n\u2018Item, that it should declare, that this holy council, as representing\nthe universal church of God, has a right to take cognizance of the\nmerits of the two competitors for the papacy.\n\n\u2018Item, that a narrative should this day be read of the introduction and\ncommencement of the schism that took place from the time of the death\nof pope Gregory X. until the convention of this holy general council.\n\n\u2018In this narrative were displayed all the tricks and deceits that had\nbeen made use of, either individually or conjunctively by the two rival\npopes.\n\n\u2018After it had been read, the advocate fiscal drew several conclusions\nagainst the said rivals and their pretensions to the papacy, and ended\nhis harangue by demanding that they should be deposed and punished\ncorporally, and that the council should proceed to the election of a\ntrue and holy pope.\n\n\u2018The sittings were prolonged to Saturday the 27th day of the same\nmonth, when the ambassadors from the king of England entered the\ncouncil with a most magnificent state.--The bishop of Salisbury[27],\nin the diocese of Canterbury, made a handsome speech, urging the\nnecessity of peace and union in the church.\n\n\u2018When he had finished, the advocate-fiscal made an interesting oration,\nand concluded by demanding, through the procurator of the holy council,\nthat it would please to appoint a commission of certain wise, discreet,\nand experienced persons to examine witnesses as to the notorious sins\ncharged on the two competitors for the papacy, and his request was\ngranted.\n\n\u2018The second Sunday after Easter, mass was celebrated before the\ncardinals, and the sermon was preached by the bishop of Digne in\nProvence: he was of the order of Friars Minors, a learned doctor in\ndivinity, and had ever been a great friend to Pietro della Luna, and\nwas well acquainted with the tricks and cavils of both popes. This\nbishop delivered a good sermon from his text of \u2018Mercenarius fugit,\u2019 in\nwhich he discovered many deceptions of the two rivals, in descanting on\nthe words of his text.\n\n\u2018The sittings were continued from this Sunday to the 2d day of May,\nwhen mass was said before the cardinals; and the sermon was preached\nby the cardinal Prenestin, more commonly called the cardinal of\nPoitiers.--He delivered a good discourse, and chose for his text,\n\u2018Libera Deus Israel ex omnibus tribulationibus suis.\u2019 He urged in his\nsermon eleven conclusive arguments against the two popes, for refusing\nto give peace to the church, and ended by requiring the council, in\nconsideration of their obstinate contumacy, to proceed against them and\nprovide a pastor for the flock of God.\n\n\u2018On the 2d day of May, there was a general meeting of the council,\nwhen, after the usual solemnities, a very renowned doctor of Bologna\nmade a reply to the insidious propositions of the bishop of Verdun, on\nthe part of the emperor Robert. He condemned, by arguments drawn from\ndivine, canon, and civil law, all that had been advanced by the bishop;\nand his reasoning was so just and clear that the council were much\nsatisfied and comforted.\n\n\u2018The ensuing Sunday, mass was said before the cardinals, and the sermon\nwas preached by the general of the order of Augustins. He was a great\ndoctor in divinity, and a native of Italy. He chose for his text, \u2018Cum\nvenerit ille arguet mundum de peccato, et de justitia, et de judicio.\u2019\nHe discussed this subject very well, and with a good intent.\n\n\u2018The sittings were prolonged from this 2d of May to the 10th.--The\npatriarch of Alexandria celebrated mass before the cardinals on the\nfeast of the revelation of St Michael, the 8th of May; and he likewise\npreached a sermon, taking for his text, \u2018Congregata est ecclesia ex\nfiliis Israel et omnes qui fugiebant a malis additi sunt, et facti\nsunt illis ad firmamentum.\u2019 These words are written in the 2nd and 5th\nchapters of the first book of Machabees. In the course of this sermon,\nhe pressed six arguments against the two rival popes.\n\n\u2018On Friday, the 10th of May, the council, after the usual solemnities,\nresumed its sittings, when the advocate-fiscal made the following\nrequisitions: that the holy council would be pleased to confirm and\napprove the demands he had before made, namely, that it should declare\nthat the union of the two colleges of cardinals has been and is legal;\nand that the council should pronounce definitively on the other demands\nhe had made. The procurator fiscal made a request to the council, that\neight days should be allowed for the production of witnesses; and the\ncouncil was adjourned to the 16th of May.\n\n\u2018On the Sunday preceding that day, mass was said before the cardinals\nby the bishop of Faenza; and the sermon preached by a native of\nArragon, a learned doctor in divinity, who had always been of the party\nof Pietro della Luna. He chose his text from one of St Paul\u2019s epistles,\n\u2018Expurgate vetus fermentum ut sitis nova conspersio.\u2019 He expatiated on\nthis with such ability that all the doctors wondered. Drawing from it\ncertain conclusions, he said that the two rivals were as much popes\nas his old shoes, calling them worse than Annas and Caiaphas, and\ncomparing them to the devils in hell.\n\n\u2018Such things passed in the council to the 23d day of this present\nmonth, as I have briefly related, on which day the ambassadors from the\nking of Spain were to come to Pisa. The number of prelates that were\npresent cannot be estimated, for they were daily increased by new ones,\nwho came from all parts of Christendom. I should suppose that at the\nlast sitting of the council there were present of cardinals, bishops,\narchbishops, and abbots, wearing mitres, one hundred and forty, without\ncounting the non-mitred members.\n\n\u2018There were also ambassadors from the kings of France, England,\nJerusalem, Sicily, Cyprus, and Poland; from the dukes of Brabant,\nAustria, Stephen of Bavaria, William of Bavaria; from the counts of\nCleves and of Brandac[28]; from the marquis of Brandenbourg and de\nMoraine[29]; from the archbishops of Cologne, Mentz and Saltzbourg, and\nfrom the bishop of Maestricht; from the grand master of the Teutonic\norder; from the patriarch of Aquileia, and from many princes in Italy.\nNumbers of doctors in divinity, and in the canon and civil law, were\npresent, as well from France as from other countries, and very many\nprocurators from divers parts of the world, who, by the grace of God,\nhave held instructive and charitable conversations together from the\ncommencement of the council until this moment.\n\n\u2018In the city of Pisa are abundance of all sorts of provisions, which\nare sold at reasonable prices; but they would be much cheaper, were\nit not for the gabelles and taxes that are levied in these countries.\nIn my mind, Pisa is one of the handsomest cities existing: it has a\nnavigable river, within a league distant, running into the sea,--and\nwhich river brings large vessels, laden with different merchandise, to\nthe town. Around the city are vineyards of white grapes and many fine\nmeadows.\n\n\u2018We are very well lodged, considering the great number of men at\narms quartered in it for its guard. The town has been conquered by\nthe Florentines, who have banished many of the Pisans to prevent any\ntreasons, and sent them to Florence, to the amount of two thousand; and\nthey are obliged to show themselves twice every day to the governor at\nan appointed place, under pain of death.\n\n\u2018Four or five thousand of the Pisans went to ask succour from king\nLancelot[30], who, in compliance with their request, advanced within\nfive leagues of Pisa, with a force of twenty-three thousand combatants,\nas well horse as foot; but the Florentines, through the grace of God,\nare well able to resist all his power, and guard us. True it is, that\nthis king Lancelot ran a risk of losing his kingdom by the union of\nthe holy church, for he had tyrannically seized on a large part of the\npatrimony of St Peter.\n\n\u2018It was said that there were certain ambassadors from Pietro della Luna\nat the council, not with the intent of forwarding the union, but of\nthrowing every obstacle in its way.\n\n\u2018There were nineteen cardinals of both colleges, at this council\nat Pisa, including the cardinal de Challan, whose attendants were\narrived,--and the cardinal was to follow with the ambassadors from\nSavoy.\n\n\u2018My lords the cardinals are much displeased with those bishops,\nabbots, and chapters of cathedral churches, who have neglected to send\nprocurators to this general council. I have nothing more to send to\nyou at present.--Written at Pisa the 15th day of May, by your humble\nmonk and servant, the abbot of St Maxence.\u2019\n\nThe direction was, \u2018To the reverend father in JESUS CHRIST, and by the\ngrace of God, lord bishop of Poitiers, and chancellor to my lord the\nduke of Berry.\u2019\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. IX.\n\n    THE AMBASSADORS TO THE COUNCIL FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF PARIS\n    WRITE LETTERS, TO INFORM THOSE WHO HAD SENT THEM OF WHAT\n    HAD PASSED AT THIS COUNCIL.--PIETRO DELLA LUNA AND GREGORY\n    ARE DEPRIVED OF THE PAPACY, AND ALL PERSONS FORBIDDEN BY\n    THE HOLY COUNCIL FROM OBEYING EITHER IN ANY MANNER.--PETER\n    OF CANDIA, A CORDELIER, IS ELECTED BISHOP OF ROME BY THE\n    CARDINALS.--REGULATIONS FOR THE APPROBATION OF THE GENERAL\n    COUNCIL.\n\n\nI shall now transcribe the letters written by the ambassadors from the\nuniversity of Paris to the council at Pisa, the contents of which are\nas follows.\n\n\u2018Reverend fathers, lords and masters, after offering you our humble\nrecommendation, may it please you to know, that we write to inform you\nof the conclusions entered into by the council-general, which has held\nthirteen sittings.\n\n\u2018The two rival popes, having for some time been waited for in vain,\nnotwithstanding the summons sent them, have been declared contumacious\nin respect to schism and the faith. Many decrees were passed against\nthem for their contumacy, and commissioners were appointed to examine\nwitnesses against them.\n\n\u2018Item, the council-general approved of the union of the colleges of\ncardinals, the citations served on the contending popes, and the place\nof meeting of the council, as being perfectly convenient and secure.\nThe council declared, that it was supreme on earth to take cognizance\nand judge of the charges brought against the contenders for the papacy.\nIt was also declared by the council, that it had been lawful for any\none to quit his obedience to either of the popes, from the moment they\nhad promised to abdicate the papacy; and that all suits and processes,\ncarried on against such as had quitted their obedience to either, were\nannulled and of no weight.\n\n\u2018Public charges were then made against them, and an interlocutory\nsentence passed on the notorious sins of the two competitors. This\nday, doctor Peter Paoul declared, in full council, your opinions,\nand took for his text, \u2018Congregabuntur filii Jud\u00e6 et filii Israel et\nfacient sibimet caput unum.\u2019 That is to say, Those who are come to\nthis council, and such as shall hereafter come, will choose from among\nthemselves a head to the church. A little before this, doctor Dominic\nle Petit had made a solemn harangue before all the cardinals, taking\nfor his text, \u2018Principes populorum congregati sunt cum Deo Abraham.\u2019\nThe cardinals and prelates of the holy church are styled princes of\nthe people. On this day also, the theologians, to the number of six\nscore and three, delivered their opinions, and eighty of them are your\nfriends and supporters.\n\n\u2018Item, this day it has been ordered that the two rival popes be\nsummoned to appear at the doors of the church on Wednesday the 5th of\nJuly, to hear their definitive sentence.\n\n\u2018Gregory has sent a bull to the English to entreat they would be of his\nparty, with Robert king of the Romans, to change the place of holding\nthe council, and that they would please to be of his council; but\nhe labours in vain, for the English, Germans, Bohemians, Polanders,\nFrench, those from Cyprus, Rhodes and Italy, are all unanimous,\nexcepting Robert, whose ambassadors have gone away.\n\n\u2018Few prelates have come to this council from the kingdom of Hungary.\nKing Ladislaus wrote that he intended being here in person, but he is\nfully occupied in his war against the infidels.\n\n\u2018Pietro Mastin, called della Luna, has issued a most thundering bull,\nin which he admonishes the cardinals to return to their duty toward\nhim; and should they refuse, he prohibits them from attempting to\nmake another election, menacing them, in case of disobedience, with\nexcommunication and other penalties against them and their supporters.\n\n\u2018Reverend fathers, and redoubted masters, we have nothing more for the\npresent to write to you, except that all nations seem inclined to a\nreformation in the church, which the new pope, whom it shall please\nGod to elect, will be forced to comply with. Should you have any orders\nto send us, we are ready to obey them to the utmost of our power.\nBeseeching you humbly to keep all our concerns in your consideration,\nmay the Sovereign Lord have you under his guard!\n\n\u2018Written at Pisa the 29th day of May.\u2019 Underneath were signed the\nnames of Dominic le Petit, Pierre Paoul de Quesnoy, Jean Pere Ponce,\nVincent, Eustace de Faquemberge, Arnoul Vibrant, Jean Bourlet, dit\nFran\u00e7ois.--Master Pierre de Poingny and master Guillaume le Charpentier\ndid not sign the above, because they were absent.\n\nHere follows the sentence on the two contending popes.\n\n\u2018This present holy council, assembled in the name of JESUS CHRIST,\nwithdraws itself from the obedience to Pietro della Luna, called Pope\nBenedict XIII. and from Angelo Corrario, called Pope Gregory XII.; and\nthe holy council decrees and declares, that all true Catholics ought to\ndo the same.\n\n\u2018Item, the same holy synod, as representative and judge of the\nuniversal church, after mature consideration and examination of\nwitnesses concerning the horrible sins of the two contending popes,\npronounces, in the church of Pisa, this its definitive sentence, that\nboth popes be deprived of every honour and dignity, especially that of\nthe papacy. It also pronounces, that they be separated from the holy\nchurch, in conformity to the sacred canons, and by the above sentence,\nforbidding all persons to have the boldness ever to defend or obey\neither of them as pope.\n\n\u2018The council forbids any Christians from obeying or showing favour\nto either, notwithstanding any oath or promise they may have made or\nentered into, under pain of excommunication,--and decrees, that whoever\nshall disobey this sentence shall be delivered into the hands of\nsecular justice, and condemned as one who favours heretics, and that he\nshall be punished according to the divine commandments, and the decrees\nof the holy canons.\n\n\u2018The council also declares and pronounces, that all promotions of\ncardinals made by the two rival popes, namely, those made by Angelo\nCorrario since the 3d day of May, and by Pietra della Luna since the\n15th day of June, of the year 1408, have been and are of no effect,\nand are annulled by this definitive sentence. It also declares, that\nevery judgment given by the aforesaid competitors for the papacy, to\nthe prejudice of the holy church, against any kings, princes, lords,\npatriarchs, archbishops, bishops, prelates of the church, or other\nprivate persons, are of no effect; and the holy synod has ordained that\nproceedings to the contrary, and to the welfare of the holy church\nshall commence on the ensuing Monday, the 10th day of June.\u2019\n\nThe above sentences and declarations were passed in the general council\nof Pisa, the 5th day of June, in the year 1409.\n\nThe 26th day of June, in the year 1409, Peter of Candia, a Cordelier\nand native of Greece, doctor of divinity, and usually called the\nCardinal of Milan, was unanimously chosen pope by the cardinals at\nPisa, with the approbation of the general council, and called Alexander\nV. who, immediately after his election, published the following bull.\n\n\u2018Alexander, bishop and servant to the servants of God, to the bishop\nof Paris, health and apostolical benediction. Praise and glory be to\nthe God of heaven for having instilled into the minds of men a desire\nof peace on earth, and who, through his benign grace and mercy, has\nbrought about an union of his Christian people, hitherto long disturbed\nby a dangerous schism.\n\n\u2018Who is there among mankind that will not most heartily rejoice at\nthis happy event, on considering the perils souls must run when such\ndivisions take place in the holy church, and which have for so long a\ntime been encouraged by sacrilegious schismatics?\n\n\u2018Our blessed God, taking pity on his people, who had long suffered\nfrom this division, opened and illuminated the minds of the holy\ngeneral council, who have justly condemned the two popes, according\nto the sacred canons, as enemies to God and his holy church, by their\nenormous, horrible, and notorious sins.\n\n\u2018When our brethren, the venerable Cardinals of the holy roman church,\nof whom we were one, were desirous of finding a proper pastor for the\nChristian flock, after the usual ceremonies and solemnities, with the\nconsent of the council-general, they entered into conclave, where,\nafter long discussions, they unanimously selected our humble self, then\ncardinal-priest of the church of the Twelve Apostles, and chose us\nbishop of Rome. Although we knew our unworthiness of so great a charge,\nconsidering our weakness, yet, always confiding in the aid of God, we\nhave accepted of it.\n\n\u2018Venerable brother, these things we notify to thee, as one loving and\ndesirous of the peace of the church, as we have been well informed;\nand we exhort thee and thy flock to render thanks to the all-powerful\nGod for this most gracious gift which he has granted to us. We have so\ngreat an affection for thy worthy person, that we inform thee, that we\nare ready to serve thee and thine to the utmost of our power.--This\npresent letter we have intrusted to be delivered to thee by our\nwell-beloved son, that notable man Paulin d\u2019Arc\u00e9, esquire of honour,\nchamberlain, and our loyal servant.--Given at Pisa the 8th day of July,\nin the first year of our papacy.\u2019\n\nIt is the good pleasure of our very sacred lord Alexander V. by divine\nProvidence, pope, that all promotions, translations, confirmations and\ncollations whatever, and all consecrations of bishops and others, that\nhave been granted or performed by the two competitors for the papacy,\nshall be considered as strictly legal, provided they were effected\nprior to passing of the definitive sentence, and done according to the\nregulations of the canon law.\n\nItem, it is also the pleasure of the general council, that our\naforesaid lord shall give his orders concerning the archbishop of Genoa.\n\nItem, the benefices in the church, that had been given by ordinary\njudges, have the approbation of the holy council to continue to them to\nwhom they have been given.\n\nItem, the holy council approves of proceedings being instituted against\nall who shall obstinately obey or favour either of the late competitors\nfor the papacy, Pietro della Luna or Angelo Corrario,--and the council\ncondemns such, as guilty of schism and notorious heresy, and ordains\nthat they be punished according to the regulations of the sacred canons.\n\nItem, it is ordered, that should the cardinal de Flisque[31] be willing\nto return to his duty, and appear personally within two months, he\nshall be kindly received, and enjoy all his honours and benefices,\nwhich he obtained in the year 1408.\n\nItem, all dispensations given by bishops of dioceses in those parts\nnot obedient to the two competitors, in the cases of persons not being\nof sufficient age to obtain dignities in the church or benefices,--and\nall absolutions, and acts of penitence, ordained by the competitors\nduring the schism, shall be reserved to the determination of the holy\napostolic see. All of which has been approved of and certified by the\nholy council.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. X.\n\n    THE DEATH OF THE BISHOP OF PARIS.----THE MARRIAGES, OF THE\n    DUKE OF BRABANT WITH THE NIECE OF THE KING OF BOHEMIA,--OF THE\n    CONSTABLE OF FRANCE\u2019S DAUGHTER WITH THE SON OF MONTAGU, GRAND\n    MASTER OF THE HOUSEHOLD,--OF THE KING OF CYPRUS WITH CHARLOTTE\n    DE BOURBON.\n\n\nIn these days, the lord John d\u2019Orgemont, bishop of Paris, departed this\nlife, in his episcopal palace, about the end of June. He was succeeded\nin his bishoprick by the lord Gerard de Montagu, bishop of Poitiers,\nchancellor to the duke of Berry, and brother to the grand master of\nthe king\u2019s household and to the archbishop of Sens. He was honourably\nreceived in the cathedral church of N\u00f4tre Dame in Paris, the 22d day of\nSeptember following.\n\nThe king of France, the dukes of Berry, Burgundy, and Bourbon, the king\nof Navarre, and several other princes, with prelates and churchmen\nwithout number, were present at his consecration. With the aid of the\ngrand master, his brother, the feast he gave on the occasion was the\nmost magnificent ever seen, in regard to the quantity of gold and\nsilver plate, and the diversity and abundance of meats and liquors.\nFrom this grand display, the princes observed that the grand master\ngoverned the king as he pleased; and they began to form suspicions as\nto the uprightness of his conduct.\n\nOn the 16th day of July following, duke Anthony of Brabant married, at\nBrussels, the niece of the king of Bohemia[32], heiress to the duchy\nof Luxembourg in right of her father. This marriage had been concluded\nby the mediation of the bishop of Ch\u00e2lons and sir Regnier Pot.\n\nSeveral knights, esquires, ladies and damsels of high rank, had\naccompanied the lady to Brussels, according to the orders of the king\nof Bohemia, her uncle. There were present at these nuptials the two\nbrothers of the duke of Brabant, the duke of Burgundy and the count de\nNevers, with their sister, wife to duke William count de Hainault; the\ncount de Charolois and the countess of Cleves, children to the duke of\nBurgundy; the marquis du Pont, his brother John[33] and their sister,\nthe countess de St Pol[34], all three children to the duke de Bar; the\ncounts de Namur and de Conversant, with their ladies, with many more of\nthe great nobility of both sexes.\n\nThe count de Clermont, son to the duke de Bourbon, was also there,--and\nwhen he tilted was attended by the duke of Burgundy and count de\nNevers. The duke bore his shield and the count his lance, to the\nsurprise of many present, on account of the great hatred that had so\nlately subsisted between them for the murder of the duke of Orleans:\nhowever, they seemed then to be in perfect concord. This feast was\nabundantly served with all sorts of provisions and wines,--and when it\nwas ended, the different guests retired to their respective countries.\n\nOn the last day but one of the same month of July, the marriage of the\ndaughter of the lord d\u2019Albret, constable of France, with the eldest\nson of Montagu[35], grand master of the king\u2019s household, was solemnly\ncelebrated. The queen of France and numbers of the great nobles were\npresent,--and the whole of the expense was paid by the king, which\ncreated much anger and envy in several of the princes of the blood\nagainst Montagu.\n\nAt this time, the truces were broken between the kings of France and of\nEngland, but only at sea; and a bitter naval war ensued, to the great\nloss of many merchants in each country.\n\nOn the 2d day of August, John de Lusignan, king of Cyprus, espoused by\nproxy, Charlotte de Bourbon, sister-german to the count de la Marche.\nThe ceremony was performed in the castle of Melun, in the presence of\nthe queen of France, the duke of Acquitaine and her other children,\nthe king of Navarre, the dukes of Berry and of Bourbon, the counts de\nla Marche and de Clermont, the lord Louis de Baviere, brother to the\nqueen, and many ladies and damsels, who greatly amused themselves in\ntournaments, dances, in feastings and other pastimes.\n\nThe lady Charlotte, queen of Cyprus, was very handsome, and well\nendowed with noble and gracious manners. On the conclusion of these\nfeasts, she departed for Cyprus, most honourably accompanied by the\nnobles so ordered by her brother, and also by those who had been sent\nto her from the king of Cyprus. She landed at the port of Chermes,\nwhither the king came to meet her, much rejoiced at her safe arrival,\nand conducted her, attended by the greater part of the nobility of\nthe island, to Nicosia, where were made many feasts, according to the\ncustom of the country. They reigned for a long time with much honour,\nand had two children, of whom more shall be spoken hereafter.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XI.\n\n    THE DUKE OF BURGUNDY HOLDS A GREAT COUNCIL AT LILLE ON HIS\n    AFFAIRS.--THE DEATH OF THE DUCHESS OF ORLEANS.\n\n\nOn the 5th of August, and the eight succeeding days, duke John of\nBurgundy held a grand council in his town of Lille, on his own affairs,\nand on the means of reconciling his brother and brother-in-law, the\nduke of Brabant and duke William of Holland, who had quarrelled for a\ncause before mentioned.\n\nWith these two dukes, there were also present the duke of Burgundy\u2019s\nsister, the wife of duke William, the bishop of Liege, and the count\nde Namur. At length, the duke of Burgundy made peace between them, on\ncondition that duke William should pay to the duke of Brabant, for all\nhis demand of debt, the sum of seventy thousand golden florins of the\ncoin of France, by different instalments.\n\nWhen this had been settled, the duke of Burgundy went, about the\nmiddle of August, to Paris, by orders from the king and royal council:\nhe was accompanied by many men at arms, whom he quartered in the\nvillages round Paris. The reason why he was attended by such a force\nwas, because the duke of Brittany had lately brought from England\ngreat numbers of English, and, in conjunction with his Bretons, was\ncarrying on a sharp war against the old countess of Penthievre[36]\nand her lands. The queen of France and the king\u2019s ministers were much\ndispleased at this conduct of the duke of Brittany, because it was to\nthe prejudice of the realm. The duke had increased this displeasure\nagainst him by having beaten and ill treated his duchess, daughter to\nthe king of France, for blaming him on account of his undertaking this\nwar.\n\nIt was therefore intended, that the duke of Burgundy should march the\nforces he had brought, attended by other princes and captains, against\nthe duke of Brittany, to conquer his country and oblige him to submit\nto the king. The duke of Burgundy was very desirous of succouring\nthe countess and her fair son, the count de Penthievre; but while the\npreparations were making, the duke of Brittany, informed by some of\nhis friends that he was in the ill graces of his mother in law, the\nqueen of France, and of those who governed the king, sent, by advice\nof his council, certain ambassadors to Paris, to offer to submit his\ndifferences with the countess de Penthievre to the king and council,\nwhich was at length accepted, through the interference of the king of\nNavarre.\n\nThe countess de Penthievre and her son were summoned to Paris, whither\nalso came the duke of Brittany, when, after some discussions, peace was\nmade between them.\n\nIn this same month, Isabella, the king of France\u2019s eldest daughter, and\ndowager queen of England, but wife to Charles duke of Orleans, died\nin childbed. The duke bitterly lamented her loss, but received some\nconsolation out of regard to the daughter she had brought him.\n\nThe patriarch of Alexandria, bishop of Carcassonne, succeeded Guy de\nRoye (whose murder has been noticed) in the archbishoprick of Rheims,\nand the archbishop of Bourges succeeded to the patriarchate. Doctor\nWilliam Bouratier, secretary to the king, was nominated archbishop\nof Bourges; and nearly about this time died doctor Peter Paoul, and\nwas succeeded in his dignities by doctor Gilles des Champs, almoner\nto the king. Louis de Harcourt, brother to the count de Harcourt, was\nappointed archbishop of Rouen.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XII.\n\n    THE TOWN OF GENOA REBELS AGAINST BOUCICAUT, MARSHAL OF FRANCE,\n    THE GOVERNOR, WHILE OBEYING A SUMMONS FROM THE DUKE OF MILAN.\n\n\nBoucicaut, marshal of France, was at this time governor of Genoa, and\nresided there. He was called upon by the duke of Milan and his brother,\nthe count of Pavia[37], to settle a dispute which had arisen between\nthem, respecting part of their dominions. He accepted the invitation,\nthinking he should do an agreeable service to the duke of Milan, and\nnot suspecting any trick in the matter. But during his absence, the\ninhabitants of Genoa rebelled against his government, and sent for some\nof their allies and accomplices to come to them.\n\nThey cruelly murdered the marshal\u2019s lieutenant, the chevalier de\nColletrie, named Chollette, a native of Auvergne, which the other\nFrenchmen hearing of, fled into the forts, for fear of suffering a\nsimilar fate. These were instantly besieged by the Genoese, who sent\nfor the marquis of Montferrat[38]: he lost no time in hastening to\ntheir aid with four thousand combatants, as they had promised to pay\nhim ten thousand florins yearly,--and they immediately elected him doge\nof Genoa. They also chose twelve knights, as a council to manage public\naffairs.\n\nA few days after, Fassincault[39], a very renowned captain in Italy,\nand a great friend of the marquis of Montferrat, came to Genoa with\nthe intent of assisting the marquis; but the Genoese refused to admit\nhim, or accept of his offers. On his return, his force, amounting\nto eight thousand men, took a town called Noefville; but the French\nretreated within the castle, which was instantly besieged.\n\nWhen Boucicaut heard of the rebellion of the Genoese, he set out\naccompanied by his men, and the duke of Milan and the count of Pavia,\nand arrived with speed at the castle of Gaing[40], situated between the\ntown of Noefville[41] and Genoa, and fought with Fassincault and his\nforces. In this battle, eight hundred men were slain, the greater part\nbelonging to Fassincault,--and night alone separated the combatants.\n\nBoucicaut, by the advice of Enguerrand de Bournouville and Gaiffier\nde la Salle, both men at arms of acknowledged prowess, advanced that\nnight to the castle of Gaing, which he won, and amply provided it with\nprovision and all necessary stores. Fassincault remained in the town;\nbut seeing he could not gain the castle, he departed with his men to\nhis own fortresses.\n\nThe marshal Boucicaut carried on a severe warfare against the Genoese\nand those who had assisted them. He also sent messengers to inform\nthe king of France of his situation, and to require that he would\nimmediately send him reinforcements of men at arms.--The king and his\ngreat council, on receiving this intelligence and considering the\nfickleness of the Genoese, determined to proceed cautiously against\nthem. The king sent, at his expense, the lords de Torsy, de Rambures,\nand de Viefville, with a certain number of men at arms, to the city of\nAsti, belonging to the duke of Orleans, and near to the territory of\nGenoa, with the hope of affording assistance to Boucicaut.\n\nOn their arrival at Asti, they found that the whole country was in\nrebellion, excepting some forts, which held out for the French; but as\nthey were without the town, and could not contain many men, from dread\nof wanting provision, they were not of consequence, nor could they do\nmuch mischief. The above knights, therefore, perceiving they could not\nperform any essential services, resolved to return to France.\n\nAll merchants, and others who came from or had any connexions with\nGenoa, were now sought after in Paris, arrested and imprisoned, and\ntheir goods confiscated to the king\u2019s use. Now these Genoese had for a\nlong time been under obedience to the king, and had diligently served\nhim in many of his wars.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XIII.\n\n    THE PRINCES OF THE BLOOD ASSEMBLE, AND RESOLVE TO REFORM THE\n    MANAGEMENT OF THE ROYAL FINANCES.--THE DEATH OF MONTAGU.\n\n\nAt this period, the following princes of the blood,--Louis king of\nNavarre[42], the dukes of Berry, Burgundy, and Bourbon, and many other\ngreat lords, were at Paris; and having learnt that the king\u2019s treasury\nwas impoverished by his officers and those who governed him, insomuch\nthat his plate and the greater part of his jewels were in pawn, they\none day personally explained to the king, in the presence of the queen,\nthe duke of Acquitaine and others of his council, the miserable state\nof his finances, and the unworthy government of the officers of his\nhousehold. They at the same time requested, that he would be pleased\nto permit that some of them should have power to reform in general the\nabuses that had commenced with his reign, and to call to an account,\ndismiss, and punish all who should have mismanaged the finances,\naccording as the cases might require, without any exception whatever.\n\nThis request the king granted; and for the better carrying on their\nobject, the greater part of the lords before mentioned left their\nown h\u00f4tels, and resided in the king\u2019s palace of St Pol, where, with\nthe advice of the members of the parliament and the university, they\ncontinued their reformations for many days.\n\nThey soon discovered that those who had managed the finances for the\nlast sixteen or twenty years had very dishonestly acquitted themselves,\nand had acquired for themselves and their friends immense fortunes,\nto the prejudice of the state. Montagu, who had been the principal\nminister of finance, was particularly the object they aimed at,--and\nthey ordered him, with several others, to be arrested and confined in\nthe prisons of the Ch\u00e2telet.\n\nSir Peter des Essars, provost of Paris, was directed to put this order\ninto execution, with his sergeants; and by the command of the duke of\nBurgundy, the lords de Heylly, de Robais, and sir Roland de Vequerque,\nwere appointed to assist the provost in this duty. Having assembled\ntogether, they, on a certain day, met Montagu, and with him the doctor,\nMartin Gouge, bishop of Chartres, both going to hear mass at the\nmonastery of St Victor.\n\nThe provost, attended by the above lords, on meeting them, laid his\nhands on both, saying, \u2018I lay hands on you by virtue of the royal\nauthority vested in me for this purpose.\u2019--Montagu, hearing these\nwords, was much astonished, and trembled greatly; but his courage soon\nreturned, and he replied to the provost, \u2018What! rascal, art thou daring\nenough to lay hands on me?\u2019 But the provost answered, \u2018Matters will\nnot turn out as you think,--for you must make reparation for the many\nand great mischiefs you have done.\u2019\n\nMontagu, unable to resist, was tightly bound by the provost, and\ncarried by him straight to the little Ch\u00e2telet. The bishop of Chartres\nwas arrested with him, as he had been president of one of the financial\ndepartments. Montagu was several times put to the torture, insomuch\nthat, suspecting his end was approaching, he asked his confessor what\nhe had best do: the confessor replied, \u2018I see no other remedy than your\nappealing from the jurisdiction of the provost of Paris.\u2019 This he did;\nand the provost waited on the lords who had commanded him to arrest\nMontagu, to inform them, that he had appealed against his jurisdiction.\nThe parliament was consequently convoked to examine into the matter;\nand the members of it declared the appeal of no effect. The lords,\ntherefore, seeing the cause had been judged, said to the provost, \u2018Go,\nwithout delay, accompanied by some of the populace well armed, take thy\nprisoner, and finish the matter by cutting off his head with an axe,\nand fix it on a lance in the market-place.\u2019\n\nAfter these words, the populace armed themselves, and, on the 17th\nof October, assembled in bodies in the place Maubert, and in other\nparts of the town. They carried Montagu to a scaffold erected in the\nmarket place, where, having made him strip to his shirt, they cut off\nhis head, and fixed it to the end of a pike, and hung his body by the\nshoulders to the highest gibbet at Montfaucon. This execution was\nchiefly owing, as it was said, to the duke of Burgundy\u2019s hatred to him,\nwho even sent for a very great number of the nobles of his countries of\nBurgundy, Flanders, and Artois, to be spectators of it.\n\nA little before this execution took place, the duke of Bourbon, and\nhis son the count de Clermont, left Paris, indignant at the arrest of\nMontagu. The duke of Orleans, his brothers, and all of their party,\nwere also very much displeased that he was put to death,--but they\ncould not help it, for at that time they were not listened to by the\nking\u2019s council.\n\nOn the morrow of this event, duke William count of Hainault arrived at\nParis, having been sent for by the duke of Burgundy. A large company of\nthe nobles went out of the town to meet him; and he was most graciously\nreceived by the king, the duke of Acquitaine and the other princes. On\nhis arrival, the h\u00f4tel that had belonged to Montagu was given to him,\nwith all its furniture, for it had been confiscated to the king\u2019s use;\nand duke William took instant possession.\n\nThe castle of Marcoussi, which had been built by Montagu, was seized\nby the king: it is situated seven leagues from Paris, on the road to\nChartres. Montagu was born in Paris, and had first been secretary\nto the king: he was the son of Gerard de Montagu, who had also been\nsecretary to Charles V. He was of noble birth by his mother\u2019s side, and\nhad three daughters, two of whom were married; the elder to John[43]\ncount de Roussy, the second to Peter de Craon, lord of Montbason;\nand the third was betrothed to John de Melun, son to the lord\nd\u2019Antoing[44], but the match was broken off: his son was married to the\ndaughter of the lord d\u2019Albret, constable of France and cousin to the\nking, as has been related.\n\nAfter this, the provost of Paris arrested many of the king\u2019s officers,\nparticularly those who had been concerned in the finances and in\nmatters of revenue. All the principals in the department of the\ngeneralities, the presidents and others of the chamber of accounts,\nPerrin Pillot, a merchant, with several others, were imprisoned in the\nLouvre and in other places of confinement.\n\nWhen the borgne de Foucal, equerry to the king, and keeper of that\ndepartment of the treasury called the Epargne, heard that the grand\nmaster of the household was arrested, he was greatly astonished and\ntroubled, and, instantly changing his dress, mounted a fleet horse, and\nsecretly left Paris. This caused him to be much suspected of improper\nconduct by the princes who were examining into these matters.\n\nAt this period, the archbishop of Sens, brother to the grand master,\nGuichart Daulphin, William de Tignonville, knights, and master Goutier\nCol, secretary to the king, were sent, by orders from the king, to meet\nthe english ambassadors at Amiens. The archbishop, hearing of the\narrest and imprisonment of his brother, took leave of his companions,\nand set out from Amiens: but as he was journeying toward Paris, he was\nmet by one of the king\u2019s ushers, who made him his prisoner; for he had\norders so to do from the king, and confine him at Amiens, should he\nchance to find him there.\n\nThe archbishop very prudently replied, that he was ready to follow him\nto prison or to death; but when they came to the river Oise, near the\npriory of St Leu de Cherens, he played the usher a trick. On leaving\nthe ferry boat with a few of his people, he mounted the fleetest of his\nhorses, and galloped off, leaving the usher on the other side waiting\nfor the return of the ferry-boat; but, thunderstruck at his being so\ncheated, he returned to Paris without his prisoner.\n\nThe lord de Tignonville, having been a member of the chamber of\naccounts, was, by command of the princes, arrested by the bailiff of\nAmiens, and confined in his prison. But after a short time, he, the\nbishop of Chartres, and the other prisoners at Paris, were suspended\nfrom their offices, and, having given bail, were permitted to go about\nParis, or wherever they pleased.\n\nThe princes, not being able to attend sufficiently to these matters\nof reform from their other occupations of greater weight, appointed\na commission to examine carefully into them, which commission was\ncomposed of the counts de la Marche, de Vend\u00f4me and de St Pol, with\nsome members of the parliament.\n\nThe men at arms that had been called together round Paris by the duke\nof Burgundy and others were disbanded; and each, as they returned to\nthe places whence they had come, devoured the substance of the poor\npeople, according to the custom of that time.\n\nSir Guichart Daulphin[45], before mentioned, was, by the princes,\nappointed grand master of the king\u2019s household in the room of the\nmurdered Montagu; for the king was then troubled with his usual\ndisorder.\n\nThe bishop of Paris now requested of the princes, that they would, in\ntheir mercy, permit him to have the body of his brother taken down from\nthe gibbet, and, with many tears and supplications, petitioned for\nleave to bury him. But neither of these requests was granted him by the\nprinces; on which the bishop, ashamed of the disgraceful death of one\nbrother and the flight of another, the archbishop of Sens, soon after\nquitted his see, and taking with him his sister-in-law, the widow of\nMontagu, and some of their children, for the duke of Berry had already\nappointed another chancellor, went to the estate of his sister-in-law\nin Savoy: she was the daughter of sir Stephen de la Grange, formerly\npresident of the parliament, and brother to the cardinal d\u2019Amiens.\n\nThe borgne de Foucal, not answering to the proclamations that were\nmade for his appearance, was banished the realm of France, by sound\nof trumpet in the four quarters of Paris. In like manner were the\narchbishop of Sens and many other fugitives banished the kingdom.\n\nThe king of Navarre, the dukes of Berry, Burgundy and Holland, with the\ncounts de Vend\u00f4me and de la Marche, and several great lords, waited on\nthe queen of France and the duke of Acquitaine, to make them acquainted\nwith the reasons for the executing Montagu, and what progress they had\nmade in the reformation of abuses, and the measures they had pursued\nagainst such as were criminal. The queen testified her satisfaction,\nand was contented that they should proceed as they had began. She was,\nhowever, far from being pleased with the duke of Burgundy, whom she\ndreaded, from the great power he was now possessed of, more than any of\nthe other princes, although he treated her respectfully in his speech.\n\nThe marriage of the lord Louis of Bavaria, brother to the queen, was\nagain talked of with the daughter of the king of Navarre; and he was\npresented with the castle of Marcoussi, with all its furniture and\nappurtenances, which had lately been confiscated to the king, by the\ndeath of Montagu, which was very agreeable to the queen.\n\nAfter these lords had for some days transacted business at Melun, where\nthe court was, they all returned to Paris, carrying with them master\nPeter Bosthet, president of the parliament, and some members of the\nchamber of accounts, and assembled daily to inquire after those persons\nwho had been in the receipt and expenditure of the public revenues.\n\nDuring this time, the king, who had been very ill, was restored\nto health, insomuch that on the 2d day of December, he rode from\nhis palace of St Pol, dressed in a hauberk under his robes, to the\ncathedral church of N\u00f4tre Dame, where he made his prayers, a page\ncarrying behind him a very handsome steel helmet and a moorish lance.\nHaving finished his prayers, he returned to his palace of Saint Pol.\n\nOn the morrow, he held a royal council in person, at which were present\nthe king of Navarre, the dukes of Berry, Burgundy, and of Bourbon,\nwhich last was lately returned to Paris. It was there resolved, that\nthe king should summon the following lords to attend him personally\nat the ensuing feast of Christmas, namely, the dukes of Orleans, of\nBrittany, of Brabant, of Bar, and of Lorraine: the counts of Savoy[46],\nof Alen\u00e7on, of Penthievre, of Namur, of Harcourt, of Armagnac[47],\nand in general all the great lords within his realm of France and\nDauphiny, with many prelates and other noblemen. After this summons of\nthe king, the duke of Burgundy gave orders for a large body of men at\narms to be collected in his countries of Flanders, Artois and Burgundy,\nfor the safety of his person.\n\nShortly after this council, duke William count of Hainault went to\nMelun, the residence of the queen of France, who was his near relation;\nand so managed that she, who could not bear the duke of Burgundy, and\nhad strongly supported the party adverse to him, namely, that of my\nlord the duke of Orleans, was reconciled to him.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XIV.\n\n    DUKE LOUIS OF BAVARIA ESPOUSES THE DAUGHTER OF THE KING OF\n    NAVARRE.--THE NAMES OF THE LORDS WHO CAME TO PARIS IN OBEDIENCE\n    TO THE KING\u2019S ORDERS.\n\n\nAbout this time, duke Louis of Bavaria was married at Melun to the\ndaughter of the king of Navarre, according to what has been before\nmentioned. She had previously married the eldest son of the king of\nArragon[48], who had lately been slain in a battle between him and the\nviscount de Narbonne and the Sardinians, which took place in Sardinia.\nThere was much feasting at this wedding, which was attended by many\nlords, ladies and damsels.\n\nAbout Christmas the greater part of those lords whom the king had\nsummoned, arrived at Paris: the duke of Orleans and his brothers,\nhowever, did not come. On the eve of Christmas-day, the king went to\nthe palace to hold his state, and remained there until St Thomas\u2019s day,\nwhere he celebrated most solemnly the feast of the nativity of our Lord.\n\nOn this day the following persons were seated at the king\u2019s table at\ndinner: on his right, doctor William Bouratier, archbishop of Bourges,\nwho had said the mass, next to him was the cardinal de Bar. The king\nwas seated at the middle of the table, very magnificently dressed in\nhis royal robes. On his left were the dukes of Berry and Burgundy. A\ngreat variety of ornamental plate was produced in gold and silver,\nwhich were wont to be served before the king on high feasts, but which\nhad not for some time been seen, because they had been pawned to\nMontagu, and had been found after his death in his castle of Marcoussi,\nand in other places where he had hidden them.\n\nBy orders from the princes of the blood they had been replaced, as\nusual, in the king\u2019s palace, which was a very agreeable sight to the\nnobles and people of Paris, from their regard to the honour of the\nking\u2019s person, and his royal state.\n\nA great many princes and others had obeyed the king\u2019s summons, and\nwere at this feast,--namely, the king of Navarre, the dukes of Berry,\nBurgundy, Bourbon, Brabant, duke William count of Hainault, the duke of\nLorraine, duke Louis of Bavaria, brother to the queen,--and nineteen\ncounts, namely, the count de Mortain, brother to the king of Navarre,\nthe count de Nevers, the count de Clermont, the marquis du Pont, son\nto the duke of Bar, the count de Vaudemont, the count d\u2019Alen\u00e7on, the\ncount de Vend\u00f4me, the count de Penthievre, the count de St Pol, the\ncount de Cleves, the count de Tancarville, the count d\u2019Angy[49], the\ncount de Namur, and several others, to the aforesaid amount. The number\nof knights who accompanied these princes was so great that, from the\nreport of the heralds, they were more than eighteen hundred knights,\nwithout including esquires.\n\nNevertheless, there were not in this noble company the duke of Orleans\nnor his brothers, nor the duke of Brittany, nor the lord d\u2019Albret,\nconstable of France, nor the counts de Foix, d\u2019Armagnac, and many other\npotent lords, although they had been summoned by the king in like\nmanner as the others.\n\nOn St Thomas\u2019s day, after the king had feasted his nobles in royal\nstate, the queen, by orders from the king, came from the castle of\nVincennes to Paris. All the princes, prelates, and great crowds of\npeople, went out to meet her and her son, the duke of Acquitaine, and\nconducted her to the palace, where they presented her to the king, in\nthe presence of all the before-mentioned lords. Her son had visited\nhis government, to be properly instructed in arms, and other necessary\nmatters, that he might be the better qualified to rule his kingdom when\nit should fall to him.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XV.\n\n    THE KING OF FRANCE KEEPS ROYAL STATE IN HIS PALACE, WHEREIN\n    SEVERAL OF THE GREAT LORDS BEFORE MENTIONED HOLD MANY COUNCILS\n    ON THE STATE OF THE NATION.\n\n\nIn consequence of several meetings having been held in the presence of\nthe king, queen, and duke of Acquitaine, the king ordered the great\nhall of the palace to be magnificently prepared for a royal sessions.\nThither were summoned all the principal noblemen, prelates and others,\nwhen the king appeared seated in his regal robes. On one side of him\nwere the king of Navarre and the cardinal de Bar, and on the other\nthe duke of Acquitaine, the duke of Berry, and all the other princes\nand nobles, each seated according to his rank: in like manner were\nthe prelates, knights, and clergy, and a multitude of others, seated\naccording to their respective situations in life.\n\nThen, by the king\u2019s commands, the count de Tancarville, an able and\neloquent man, harangued with a loud and clear voice, how Richard\nlate king of England, and son-in-law to the king, had been basely and\ntreacherously put to death, during the time of a truce, by Henry of\nLancaster, calling himself king of England, but then earl of Derby, in\nconjunction with his partisans, as might be fully proved by several of\nthe English, near relations of the deceased king Richard:--And also how\nthe young prince of Scotland, an ally to the king, when on his voyage\nto France, was taken by this same Henry, and detained his prisoner for\na long time; as were likewise many Scots, who were in the company of\nthe prince of Wales. Yvain Graindos[50], with several of his Welshmen,\nallies also to the king, notwithstanding the aforesaid truce, were by\nthe English harrassed with war. The eldest son likewise to the prince\nof Wales was made captive[51], carried to England, and imprisoned by\nHenry for a considerable time.\n\n\u2018In consequence of the facts above stated, the king thinks he may,\nwithout further consideration, lawfully wage war against the said\nHenry and his english subjects, without giving them any respite.\nNotwithstanding this,\u2019 continued the orator, \u2018the king is desirous that\nwhatever he may please to order should be for the common welfare of the\nstate; and for this purpose a royal sessions has been held, for every\none to consider these matters and what ought to be the line of conduct\nfor him to pursue,--and, having an opinion thereon, if they will inform\nthe king or his council thereof, the king will thank them and follow\nthat advice which shall seem to him the most advantageous for the\ngeneral good.\n\nUpon this, the eldest of the princes of the blood, namely, the king\u2019s\nuncle the duke of Berry, arose from his seat, and, advancing in front\nof the king\u2019s throne, fell on his knees, and, speaking for himself and\nthe other princes of the blood, declared they would relinquish, to the\nuse of the state, all taxes and impositions which they annually levied\non their lands,--and in like manner would they relinquish all the fees\nand perquisites of office which they were in the habit of receiving\nfrom their places under the king, and as the members of his council.\n\nThe king kindly listened to the duke\u2019s speech, and accepted his offers,\nand then commanded him to be reseated. The lord Tancarville continued\nhis harangue, saying, that the king, then present, revoked all pensions\nand grants which he had given, and thus publicly annulled them. In\nregard to the reformation and future management of the finances, the\nking declared his intention that such regulations as should be ordered\nby himself, and by the advice of the count de la Marche (who had now\nlost his wife, the daughter of the king of Navarre), his brother the\ncount de Vend\u00f4me, the count de Saint Pol, and the other commissioners\nfrom the parliament, should be fully executed without excepting any\nperson whatever; and that the reformations by them proposed should take\nplace, as well in the chambers of accounts as in the generalities and\nin the household of the king,--and that all receivers, comptrollers,\nand all persons any way interested in the management of the finances\nof the realm, whether bishops or archbishops, and of what rank soever,\nshould be subjected to them.\u2019 The orator continued,--\u2018That the king\nwilled and ordered, that during his absence, the queen should call\nto her assistance some of the princes of the royal blood, and should\ngovern the affairs of this kingdom according as she might judge most\nconducive to its welfare; and in case of the absence of the queen, the\nduke of Acquitaine, his son, then present, should govern the kingdom,\nwith the assistance of the dukes of Berry and Burgundy.\u2019\n\nWhen the lord de Tancarville had more fully enlarged on the above\nmatters, and concluded his speech, the king descended from his royal\nthrone, and, with a small company, entered his apartment to dinner; and\nthe whole assembly broke up, and departed to their h\u00f4tels.\n\nAfter the dinner, the queen set out with her attendants for the castle\nof Vincennes, as it was the eve of the feast of the Circumcision, but\nleft her son with the king. On the morrow, the feast-day, the duke of\nBurgundy (who had alone more princes, knights, and gentlemen attached\nto him than all the other princes together,) gave presents of jewels\nand rich gifts, of greater magnificence than any one, according to the\ncustom of that day. He made presents to all the knights and nobles of\nhis household, to the amount, as was estimated, of fifteen thousand\ngolden florins, of medals formed like to a mason\u2019s level, of gold and\nsilver gilt; and at the pointed ends of these levels was fastened a\nsmall gilt chain, with a plummet of gold, so that it might be used as a\nrule.\n\nItem, on Twelfth-day following, Louis king of Sicily, having been sent\nfor by the king, entered Paris. He came from the city of Pisa, whither\nhe had gone to visit pope Alexander V. and made his entry, attended by\nnumbers of the nobility and clergy, who had gone out to meet him.\n\nShortly after, the cardinal de Thurey came to Paris, as ambassador from\nthe pope to the king, who most honourably received him, as he likewise\ndid Philibert de Lignac, grand master of Rhodes, and chief of the order\nof St John of Jerusalem, who had come from England.\n\nThe king now disbanded all the troops he had collected, as did the duke\nof Burgundy, excepting about one hundred or six score gentlemen, whom\nhe retained, with those of his household, to guard his person: the\nothers returned to their homes.\n\nBefore the duke of Burgundy left Paris, the duke of Acquitaine, with\nthe consent of the king and queen, was intrusted to his care and\nguardianship, that he might be properly instructed in the arts of war\nand government. He had been very anxious to obtain this, and had caused\nseveral of the princes of the blood to press the matter: even his\nuncle, the duke of Berry, had, on this account, more than once refused\nthe queen to accept of the guardianship of the duke of Acquitaine;\nbut had so urged the business that the lord de Dolhaing[52], knight,\nhis principal esquire, counsellor and advocate, had, by the earnest\ndesire of the queen, been made chancellor to the duke of Acquitaine,\nand the lord de Saint George his first chamberlain. The government\nof the castles of Crotoy and Beaurain-sur-Canche were granted to the\nduke of Berry for his life, on giving the preceding governors the\nusual pension, in whose room he appointed two of his own knights; the\nlord de Croy to Crotoy, and the lord de Humbercourt to Beaurain; and\nsir Reginald Pot was, at his request, appointed governor of Dauphiny\nfor the dauphin. Soon after this, the king relapsed into his usual\ndisorder, and was put under good guard. Those who were intrusted with\nthe reform of abuses continued daily at work, and with such success\nthat large sums were recovered from the late directors of the finances.\n\nAt this period, the princes and council of state went often to the\ncastle of Vincennes, where the queen resided,--for without her\nknowledge no business of any importance was carried on. The dukes of\nBerry and Bourbon, however, were much discontented that they were not\nso often summoned to the council as before, and that their authority\nwas greatly lessened. Seeing themselves, as it were, banished from the\ngovernment, they took leave of the king, queen, and princes, and each\nretired to his own domains.\n\nThe cardinal de Thurey had come to Paris to solicit the university\nand council of state to consent that pope Alexander might levy\ntwo-tenths on the gallican church, to defray the great expenses he was\nbound to pay. This request was not granted, because the university\nopposed it, in the name of the whole church. The better to effect\nthis, the university required and obtained a royal mandate, to\ncommand all officers under the crown forcibly to send out of their\njurisdictions all persons who should come thither making similar\ndemands. The solicitors of this levy had brought to Paris with them\na bull containing many novelties, which were not usually advanced,\nnamely, that the tythes, and other things, such as oblations to the\nchurch, belonged to them in preference to the parochial clergy, for\nthat in fact they were in the same capacity, inasmuch as whoever should\nconfess themselves to them were not under the necessity of so doing to\ntheir own clergyman. This doctrine they publicly preached throughout\nParis, and the members of the university preached in opposition to it,\nso that during Lent the whole town was in confusion and discord by\nthese quarrels of the university and the mendicants, until they were\ndriven out of it by the university. The Jacobins, however, as the most\nprudent, renounced the bull, and made oath that they would never claim\nany advantages from it, nor from other privileges that had been granted\nto them. By this means, they were reconciled to the university. The\npope, at this period, held his court with great state in Bologna la\nGrassa.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XVI.\n\n    A GREAT DISSENSION TAKES PLACE THIS YEAR BETWEEN THE KING OF\n    POLAND, ON THE ONE HAND, AND THE GRAND MASTER OF PRUSSIA AND\n    HIS KNIGHTS ON THE OTHER.\n\n\nThis year, a great quarrel arose between the king of Poland and the\ngrand master of the Teutonic order in Prussia; and the king assembled a\nlarge force from different nations, which he marched into Prussia, with\nthe intent to destroy it.\n\nThe grand master and his brethren soon made themselves ready to meet\nhim with a great army, and showed every inclination to give him battle;\nbut when the two armies were in sight of each other, through the will\nof God, the king of Poland retreated with his forces, among which were\ntwenty thousand Tartars at least, without counting his Polanders and\nothers his Christian allies, who were very numerous, and returned to\nhis own country.\n\nAfterward, the king of Lithuania, by the exhortations of the king of\nPoland, invaded Prussia with an immense army, and destroyed the greater\npart which lay on the sea-shores. The Prussians made a thousand of them\nprisoners, and slew many.\n\nThe king of Poland was formerly an infidel, and son to the king of\nLithuania, but, having a great ambition to reign, murdered his father,\nand was for this crime banished the country. He took refuge with the\nthen king of Poland, who received him kindly, and admitted him into his\nfriendship and confidence. He also gained the affections of the princes\nand nobles, insomuch that, on the death of their king, they unanimously\nelected this parricide to succeed him, had him baptised, and married\nhim to the widow of the late king; and, since that time, he has happily\nenough governed that kingdom[53].\n\nAt this period, Sigismond king of Hungary, brother to the king of\nBohemia, took to wife the sister of the above queen of Poland: they\nwere daughters to a german count, called the count de Cilly, of the\nroyal branch of Hungary[54]. The king of Poland laid claim to Hungary\nin right of his wife, and thence took occasion to harrass that country\nas well as Prussia. He sent secret messengers to the king of Lithuania,\nhis cousin german and ally, to press him to invade Prussia on the\nquarter nearest the sea, when he would march his Polanders to form a\njunction and destroy the whole of it. His intentions were discovered\nby the messenger being arrested by orders of the king of Hungary, and\ninformation sent of them to Prussia, whenceforward the king of Hungary\nand grand master took such wise precautions that his future attempts\nwere fruitless.\n\n\n\n\n[A. D. 1410.]\n\nCHAP. XVII.\n\n    THE DUKE OF BERRY, BY THE KING\u2019S COMMANDS, RETURNS TO\n    PARIS.--THE MARRIAGE OF THE SON OF THE KING OF SICILY.--THE\n    ASSEMBLY THAT IS HOLDEN AT MEUN LE CHASTEL.\n\n\nThis year, the duke of Berry was, by the king\u2019s orders, remanded to\nParis, and, on his arrival, was sent, with the king of Navarre, to\nGiens sur Loire, to put an end to the quarrels between the duke of\nBrittany and the count and countess of Penthievre. Although both\nparties had promised to meet them, they did not personally attend, but\nsent commissioners.\n\nThe king of Navarre and the duke of Berry took great pains, and\nproposed various means, to bring about a reconciliation. Finding all\ntheir attempts fruitless, they referred the whole matter, with the\nconsent of the commissioners, to the king\u2019s decision on All-saints-day\nnext coming, and then they returned to Paris.\n\nIn this year was concluded the marriage between the eldest son of Louis\nking of Sicily, and Catherine, daughter to the duke of Burgundy. The\nlady was conducted by sir John de Ch\u00e2lons, lord de Darlay, the lord de\nSt George, sir William de Champdivers, and sir James de Courtjambe, to\nAngers, and there delivered to the queen of Sicily, who received her\nmost affectionately and honourably,--and she magnificently entertained\nthe knights who had brought her. After a short stay at Angers, they\nreturned to their lord, the duke of Burgundy, at Paris.\n\nAt this time, the dukes of Orleans and Bourbon, the counts de Clermont,\nd\u2019Alen\u00e7on, d\u2019Armagnac, the lord Charles d\u2019Albreth, constable, and many\nother lords of great power and authority, held a meeting in the town\nof Meun le Ch\u00e2tel,--where they had several long consultations with\neach other on the state of public affairs, and particularly as to the\nmurder of the late duke of Orleans, principally to consider how they\nshould proceed to take vengeance on the person who had committed it.\nMany different opinions were urged: one was, that the duke of Orleans\nshould declare a deadly war against him, and carry it on by every\npossible means, with the assistance of his relations, friends, and the\nwellwishers to his cause.\n\nOthers said, it would be better to follow another course, and\nremonstrate strongly to the king, their sovereign lord, on the\nnecessity he was under to do strict justice on the duke of Burgundy,\nto which he was the more particularly bound, as the murder was\ncommitted on his own brother. But, as they could not all agree in the\nsame opinion, they broke up the meeting, and appointed another day to\nassemble again.\n\nBefore they separated, a treaty of marriage was entered upon between\nCharles duke of Orleans and the daughter of the count d\u2019Armagnac. She\nwas niece to the duke of Berry by her mother\u2019s side, and sister[55]\nto the count de Savoye. This done, the lords departed for their own\ndomains.\n\nThe duke of Burgundy resided in Paris, and ruled there more\ndespotically than any other of the princes: affairs were solely carried\non by him and his partisans, which, no doubt, made very many jealous of\nhim.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XVIII.\n\n    THE KING OF SICILY GOES TO PROVENCE AND TO BOLOGNA, TO MEET HIS\n    RIVAL KING LADISLAUS.--THE DEATH OF POPE ALEXANDER, AND THE\n    ELECTION OF POPE JOHN.\n\n\nAbout this period, Louis king of Sicily set out from Paris with a\nnumerous body of men at arms, and went for Provence, and thence to\nBologna, to meet king Ladislaus, his opponent, and to defend his\nkingdom of Naples, where his rival was committing great devastation.\nKing Louis had for this raised so considerable a force, that he might\nbe enabled to offer him combat; and he had also the hope that pope\nAlexander would assist him, to the utmost of his ability, in money and\nin men.\n\nAn end was soon put to his expectations in this respect; for, on the\nmorrow of the feast of the discovery of the holy cross, pope Alexander\nwas poisoned in the town of Bologna, as was currently reported, and\ndied most pitifully. His bowels were interred, and his obsequies were\nperformed in the church of the Cordeliers. Mass was celebrated by the\ncardinal de Vimers: the deacon and under deacon were the cardinals\nd\u2019Espaigne and de Thurey. The whole court was dressed in deep mourning.\n\nThe 6th of May, the corpse of the pope, having been embalmed with fine\nspices, was placed in the hall of audience, dressed in his papal robes,\nhis face uncovered, gloves on his hands, but his feet naked, so that\nwhoever pleased might kiss them,--and nine funeral services were there\nperformed.\n\nThere were present twenty cardinals, two patriarchs, four archbishops,\ntwenty-four bishops, with many prelates, abbots, and other churchmen.\nHis escutcheon of arms were placed at the four corners of his coffin;\nand for nine days, masses were celebrated in the same manner as on the\nmorrow of his death. The masses were said by the cardinals in rotation;\nand the ninth day, the body was carried to the Cordeliers for interment.\n\nThe two first bearers were the cardinals de Vimers and de Challant,\nand the two last the cardinals d\u2019Espaigne and de Thurey. The cardinal\nMilles preceded the body bearing a cross. The chorists were the\ncardinals de Bar, (not the son of the duke of Bar, but the cardinal of\nBar[56] in Calabria), and d\u2019Orsini. The cardinal de Vimers performed\nthe service, as he had done at the interment of the bowels.\n\nWhen this ceremony was over, the cardinals returned home dressed in\nblack; and after dinner, they assembled at the palace, and entered\ninto conclave, where they remained shut up from the Wednesday to the\nSaturday following. Some of the cardinals, having consulted together,\nproposed Balthazar, cardinal of Bologna, as sovereign pontiff of\nthe universal church; and the others, who were not of this opinion,\nseeing their numbers were very small, consented to it; and the new\npope was conducted by them to the church of St Peter, where they placed\nthe tiara on his head, and took the oaths of fidelity to him. They\nthen led him to the palace of his predecessor, where every piece of\nfurniture had been carried off, and there did not remain even a door or\nwindow-frame.\n\nOn the morrow, he took the name of pope John XXIII. and great were the\nrejoicings and feasts that ensued. In the procession were twenty-three\ncardinals, two patriarchs, three archbishops, twenty-seven abbots,\nmitred and non-mitred, without reckoning other churchmen, who were\nalmost numberless. The pope wore on that day a silver-gilt tiara bound\nwith white. The following Saturday, the 23d of May, the pope received,\nin the chapel of his predecessors, the holy order of priesthood, when\nthe cardinal de Vimers said the mass, and the cardinal de Challant was\ndeacon: at this service, all the before-named prelates attended.\n\nOn the following day, Sunday, the pope celebrated mass in the church\nof St Peter, having the cardinal de Vimers near him to show him the\nservice. The marquis of Ferrara and the lord of Malatesta were present,\nand held the bason wherein the pope washed his hands. The marquis of\nFerrara had brought with him fifty-four knights, all clothed in scarlet\nand blue, having five trumpets and four companies of minstrels, each\nplaying on a different instrument.\n\nWhen mass was finished, pope John was carried out of the church to a\nvery handsome platform erected without the porch, and there solemnly\ncrowned in the presence of all those whom I have mentioned, and a great\nmultitude of doctors and clergy.\n\nWhen seated on his throne, which was covered all over with cloth of\ngold, he was surrounded by the cardinals de Vimers, de Challant, de\nMilles, d\u2019Espaigne, de Thurey, and de Bar, having tufts of tow in their\nhands. The cardinals lighted their tufts; and as the flame was suddenly\nextinguished, they addressed the pope, saying, \u2018Thus, holy father,\npasses the glory of this world!\u2019 This was done three times.\n\nThe cardinal de Vimers having said some prayers over him and on the\ncrown, placed it upon his head. This crown was a triple one: the first\nof gold, which encircled the forehead within the mitre; the second\nof gold and silver, about the middle of the mitre; and the third, of\nvery fine gold, surmounted it. He was then led down from the platform,\nand placed on a horse covered over with scarlet furniture. The horses\nof the cardinals and bishops, &c. were caparisoned in white; and in\nthis state he was conducted from street to street, making every where\nthe sign of the cross, until he came to where the Jews resided, who\npresented him with a manuscript of the Old Testament. He took it with\nhis own hand, and, having examined it a little, threw it behind him,\nsaying, \u2018Your religion is good, but this of ours is better.\u2019\n\nAs he departed, the Jews followed him, intending to touch him,--in the\nattempt of which, the caparison of his horse was all torn.--Wherever\nhe passed, the pope distributed money,--that is to say, quadrini and\nmailles of Florence, with other coins. There were before and behind him\ntwo hundred men at arms, each having in his hand a leathern mallet,\nwith which they struck the Jews in such wise as it was a pleasure to\nsee.\n\nOn the morrow, he returned to his palace, accompanied by the cardinals\ndressed in crimson,--the patriarchs in like manner,--the archbishops\nand bishops in similar dresses, having white mitres on their heads,\nand numbers of mitred and non-mitred abbots. In this procession were,\nthe marquis of Ferrara[57], the lord Malatesta[58], the lord of\nGaucourt[59], and others, to the amount of forty-four, as well dukes as\ncounts and knights of Italy, all dressed out in their liveries. In each\nstreet, two and two by turns led the pope\u2019s horse by the bridle,--the\none on the right hand, and another on the left.\n\nThere were thirty-six bagpipes and trumpets, and ten bands of minstrels\nplaying on musical instruments, each band consisting of three\nperformers. There were also singers, especially those of the chapel of\nhis predecessor, as well as those belonging to the cardinals and from\ndifferent parts of Italy, who rode before the pope loudly chaunting\nvarious airs, sacred and profane.\n\nWhen he arrived at the palace, he gave his peace to all the cardinals,\nwho, according to their rank in the college, kissed his foot, hand, or\nmouth. The cardinal de Vimers first performed the ceremony, and was\nfollowed by the other cardinals, patriarchs, archbishops, bishops,\nabbots and clergy. He then gave his benediction to the four elements,\nand to all persons in a state of grace, as well to those absent as\npresent, and bestowed his dispensations for four months to come,\nprovided that, during this time, three Pater-nosters should be said by\neach in praying for his predecessor, pope Alexander.\n\nPope John then went to dinner, as it was now about twelve o\u2019clock, and\nthis ceremony had commenced between five and six in the morning.\n\nIn honour of him, feasts were continued at Bologna for the space\nof eight days; and on each of them very handsome processions were\nmade round St Peter\u2019s church, when the prelates were all dressed\nin vermilion robes, with copes of the same. In like manner did the\nCarthusians of St Michael\u2019s Mount, without the walls of Bologna.\n\nThe next day, the 25th of May, pope John held a consistory, in the\npresence of the cardinals, patriarchs, archbishops, bishops, and\npresented to the marquis of Ferrara and the italian heralds, many and\nvarious rich gifts. This was followed by a great feast, with dancing\nand music. The ensuing day, the pope revoked all that his predecessor\nhad done, excepting what he had confirmed, or what had been taken\ncorporal or spiritual possession of.\n\nKing Louis of Sicily arrived at Bologna the Friday after the coronation\nof the pope, and twenty-two cardinals, two patriarchs, six archbishops,\ntwenty bishops and eighteen abbots, handsomely equipped, went out of\nthe city to meet him: on his entrance, he went directly to the pope. He\nwas clothed in scarlet, and his horse\u2019s furniture was ornamented with\nsmall gilt bells: he was attended by about fifty knights dressed in his\nuniform. It was the last day of May that the king arrived,--and he was\nmost graciously received by the pope.\n\nThe ensuing day, the Florentines came to pay their duty and reverence\nto the holy father. They were about three hundred horse, among whom\nwere eighteen knights dressed in scarlet, with feathers bespangled\nwith gold. They were attended by six trumpets, two heralds, and ten\nmusicians playing on different instruments. When they had made their\nreverence to the pope, they returned to their h\u00f4tels, and the next\nday went to court. By reason of their alliance with king Louis, they\nsupplicated the pope to give him assistance against his adversary king\nLadislaus, adding, that they intended affording him every aid in their\npower of men and money. These Florentines were very indignant at the\nlate conduct of the Genoese in regard to the king of Sicily; for when\nthe king of Sicily was sailing with five gallies from Marseilles,\nnear to the port of Genoa, the Genoese, being in the interest of king\nLadislaus, hastily armed fifteen gallies with cross-bows and men at\narms, and sent them to attack the remainder of king Louis\u2019s fleet that\nwas following him, which they conquered, all but one, that escaped\nback to Marseilles by superior sailing, and carried the crews and all\ntheir baggage prisoners to Genoa.\n\nThe pope, having heard their request, asked some time to consider of\nit before he gave an answer. He could not well consent to it, because\nthe Genoese had been long connected with him, and he had also entered\ninto some engagements with king Ladislaus. The matter was, therefore,\ndeferred. King Louis was, notwithstanding this, magnificently feasted\nby the pope and cardinals; after which, he left his court well pleased,\nand returned to Provence.\n\nOn the first day of June, the pope held an open court, and signed many\ngraces and benefices, and all such things as with honour and justice he\ncould sign. He continued from that time to hold public audiences, and\nto do whatever business appertained to the papacy.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XIX.\n\n    THE GRAND MASTER OF PRUSSIA MARCHES A POWERFUL ARMY OF\n    CHRISTIANS INTO LITHUANIA.\n\n\nThis year, 1410, the grand master of the Teutonic order, accompanied\nby his brother knights and a numerous army of three hundred thousand\nChristians, invaded the kingdom of Lithuania, to destroy the whole of\nit. The king of Lithuania was soon ready to meet him; and, aided by\nthe king of Sarmatia, he assembled an army of four hundred thousand\ninfidels, and offered battle.\n\nThe Christians gained a complete victory,--for there remained dead on\nthe field full thirty-six thousand infidels, the principals of whom\nwere the grand general of Lithuania and the constable of Sarmatia. The\nremnant, with the other officers, escaped by flight. Of the Christians,\nonly two hundred were slain, but a great many were wounded.\n\nShortly after, the king of Poland, who was a determined enemy to\nthe grand master of Prussia, (and who had but faintly accepted of\nChristianity in order to obtain his kingdom) marched his Polanders to\nthe assistance of the infidels, whom he strongly pressed to renew the\nwar against Prussia, insomuch that, eight days after this defeat, the\nking of Poland, in conjunction with the aforesaid two kings, assembled\nan army of six hundred thousand men, and marched against the grand\nmaster of Prussia, and other Christian lords. A battle ensued, which\nwas lost by the Christians, who had more than sixty thousand killed\nand wounded. In the number of dead were the grand master of Prussia,\nwith a noble knight from Normandy, called sir John de Ferriere, son to\nthe lord de Ferriere, and another from Picardy, son to the lord du Bos\nd\u2019Ancquin.\n\nIt was currently reported that the day had been lost through the fault\nof the constable of Hungary, who commanded the second squadron of the\nChristians, by running away with all his Hungarians. The infidels,\nhowever, did not gain the glory without loss,--for without counting\nthe Polanders, who had ten thousand men slain, they lost upward of\nsix-score thousand men, according to the reports of the heralds, and\nthe bastard of Scotland, called the count de Hembe[60].\n\nThe lord de Kyeuraing and John de Grez, Hainaulters, were there, and\nwith them full twenty-four gentlemen, their countrymen, who were unhurt\nat this battle, and returned home as speedily as they could.\n\nAfter the engagement, the infidels entered Prussia, and despoiled\nmany parts of it, and took twelve inclosed towns in a short time and\ndestroyed them. They would have persevered in their wickedness, and\nhave done further mischief, had not a valiant knight of the Teutonic\norder, named Charles de Mouroufle[61], rallied a great number of the\nChristians who had fled, and by his prudence and vigour regained the\ngreater part of these towns, and finally driven the infidels out of the\ncountry[62].\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XX.\n\n    THE DUKE OF BERRY QUITS PARIS, AND RETIRES TO HIS OWN\n    ESTATES.--HE GOES AFTERWARD TO ANGERS, AND UNITES WITH THE DUKE\n    OF ORLEANS AND THE OTHER PRINCES OF HIS PARTY.\n\n\nThe duke of Berry, finding that he had not that government of the\nking and the duke of Acquitaine to which he had been accustomed,\nbecame very discontented, and retired to his estates, indignant at\nthe ministers, and particularly at his nephew and godson, the duke\nof Burgundy. Shortly after, he went to Angers, where the dukes of\nOrleans and of Bourbon, and all the principal lords of that party, were\nassembled.\n\nThey went in a body to the cathedral church, and there made oath, in\nthe most solemn manner, to support each other, and mutually to defend\ntheir honour against all who should attempt any thing against it,\nexcepting the king, and ever to remain in strict friendship united,\nwithout acting to the contrary in any kind of measure.\n\nMany great lords in France were not pleased with this confederation;\nand when, shortly after, news of it was brought to the king and his\ncouncil, he was much astonished and dissatisfied therewith.\n\nThe king, in consequence of the advice of the duke of Burgundy and his\nfriends, marched out of Paris, accompanied by him, the duke of Brabant,\nthe count de Montagu, and a large body of chivalry, and went to Senlis:\nthence to the town of Creil, to regain the castle of that place, which\nthe duke of Bourbon held, and had given the government of it to some of\nhis people.\n\nThe governor made so many delays before he surrendered it that the\nking became much displeased; and because they had not obeyed his\nfirst summons, the garrison were made prisoners, and carried bound\nto the prisons of the Ch\u00e2telet in Paris. The countess of Clermont,\ncousin-german to the king, soon after made application for their\ndeliverance, and obtained it; and on the morrow the king appointed\nanother garrison, and returned to Paris.\n\nThis expedition was not very agreeable to the Orleans-faction,--and\nthey continued to collect daily, and inlist in their party as many as\nthey could.\n\nThe duke of Burgundy became very uneasy at their proceedings; for he\nsuspected the duke of Orleans and his party would infringe the peace\nwhich had so lately been patched up between them at Chartres, or that\nthey would march a large force to Paris, to seize the government,\ntogether with the persons of the king and duke of Acquitaine.\n\nTo obviate this, he caused several royal summons to be proclaimed in\nvarious parts of the realm, for the assembling of men at arms and\nquartering them in the villages round Paris, to be ready to defend the\nking and his government against the ill-intentioned. By the advice of\nhis brothers and the king of Navarre, he resolved to defend himself\nby force against his adversaries, and caused it to be proclaimed\nthroughout the kingdom, in the king\u2019s name, that no one should dare to\nassemble armed in company of the dukes of Berry and Orleans, and their\nallies, under pain of corporal punishment and confiscation of goods.\n\nThe Orleans-faction, however, continued their meetings in spite of\nthis proclamation, and even forced their vassals to serve under and\naccompany them: I mean, such of them as were dilatory in obeying their\nsummons. There were, therefore, at this time, great and frequent\nassemblies of armed men in different parts of France, to the prejudice\nof the poor people.\n\nThose lords that were well inclined to the king came to Paris, and\ntheir men were quartered in the flat country of the island of France.\nThe Orleans-party fixed their quarters at Chartres and the adjacent\nparts; and their forces might amount, according to the estimate of\nwell-informed persons, to full six thousand men in armour, four\nthousand cross-bows, and sixteen hundred archers, without counting the\nunarmed infantry, of which there were great numbers.\n\nIn regard to the army which the duke of Burgundy had assembled by\norders from the king, it was estimated to consist of upward of sixteen\nthousand combatants, all men of tried courage. During this time, the\nking of Navarre and his brother, the count de Mortain, at the request\nof the duke of Burgundy, negotiated a peace between the duke of\nBrittany, their nephew, and the count de Penthievre, son-in-law to the\nduke of Burgundy.\n\nThis was done in the hope that the duke of Brittany would be induced\nto assist the king with his Bretons, and give up the Orleans-party, to\nwhom he had engaged himself. On the conclusion of this peace between\nthe two parties, twenty thousand golden crowns were sent the duke, to\ndefray the expenses he had been at in raising men at arms.\n\nLarge sums of money were also sent to the lord d\u2019Albreth, constable\nof France, that he might collect a numerous body of men at arms, and\nmarch them to Paris, to serve the king. He had not any great desire to\nperform this, for he was wholly inclined to the duke of Orleans and his\nallies, as was perfectly notorious shortly afterward.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XXI.\n\n    THE DEATH OF THE DUKE OF BOURBON.--THE PROCLAMATION OF THE KING\n    OF FRANCE.--THE DUKE OF ORLEANS AND HIS ALLIES SEND LETTERS TO\n    THE PRINCIPAL TOWNS IN FRANCE.\n\n\nDuring this troublesome time, Louis duke of Bourbon, uncle to the\nking of France by the mother\u2019s side, being full sixty years of age,\nfeeling himself oppressed with years and sickness, caused himself to be\nconveyed to his residence at Moulins[63] in the Bourbonnois, where he\ndeparted this life, and was buried in the church of the canons, which\nhe had founded.\n\nHe was succeeded by his only son, the count de Clermont, who, after\nsome days of lamentation, had the funeral obsequies of his father\nperformed, and, having arranged his affairs, returned to the duke of\nOrleans and the other lords at Chartres, and firmly united himself with\nthem, treading in the steps of his late father. The duke of Bourbon\nhad long held the office of great chamberlain of France, from the\nfriendship of the king, and was in possession of it even at the time of\nhis death; but at the entreaty of the king of Navarre and the duke of\nBurgundy, the king now gave it to the count de Nevers, to exercise the\nduties of it in the usual manner.\n\nAt this time, the duchess of Brittany, daughter to the king of France,\nwas brought to bed of a son; and she sent to request the duke of\nAcquitaine, her brother, to stand godfather. He sent, as his proxy,\nsir David de Brimeu, knight, lord of Humbercourt, with a handsome\npresent of jewels, which sir David gave her on the part of the duke of\nAcquitaine.\n\nThe king again issued his summons to the different bailiwicks and\nseneschalships in the realm, for all persons to arm without delay who\nwere bounden so to do from the tenure of their fiefs or arriere fiefs,\nand to march instantly to Paris to serve the king against the dukes of\nOrleans, Berry, Bourbon, the counts d\u2019Armagnac, d\u2019Alen\u00e7on, and others\ntheir allies, who, notwithstanding the king\u2019s positive orders to the\ncontrary, continued daily to assemble large bodies of men at arms, to\nthe destruction of his country and subjects.\n\nThe above dukes wrote letters to the king, to the university of Paris,\nand to many of the principal towns, to explain the causes why they had\nthus confederated and collected men at arms; one of which, signed with\ntheir signs-manuel, they sent to the town of Amiens, and the contents\nwere as follows:\n\n\u2018To our well-beloved and very dear citizens, burgesses, and inhabitants\nof the town of Amiens, health and affection. We have written to\nour most redoubted and sovereign lord the king of France in manner\nfollowing:--We dukes of Berry, of Orleans, and of Bourbon, counts of\nAlen\u00e7on and of Armagnac, your humble uncles, relations and subjects,\nfor ourselves and all others our adherents, wellwishers to your\nperson,--as the rights of your domination, your crown and royal\nmajesty, have been so nobly instituted, and founded on justice,\npower, and the true obedience of your subjects,--and as your glory\nand authority are resplendent through all parts of the world, you\nhaving been worthily consecrated and anointed by the holy roman see,\nand considered by all Christendom as sovereign monarch and equal\ndistributor of justice, as well to the poor as to the rich, without\nowing obedience to any other lord, but God and his Divine Majesty, who\nhas been pleased most worthily to have gifted you,--may all those who\nare connected with you by blood, by their frank and loyal affections,\nguard and defend your sacred person as your relations and subjects.\n\n\u2018And may we, in particular, as your near relations, and for that cause\nmore obliged to it, set an example of due obedience to your other\nsubjects, and exert ourselves in preserving to you free liberty of\naction in every part of your government, insomuch that you may have\npower to reward the good and punish the wicked, and to preserve every\none in his just rights, and likewise that you may execute justice in\nsuch wise that your kingdom may remain in peace, first to the honour\nof God, and then to your own honour, and to the example of your good\nfriends and subjects, by following the paths of your predecessors,\nthe kings of France, who, by this noble way of governing their great\nkingdom, have ever preserved tranquillity and peace, insomuch that all\nChristian nations, far and near, and even infidels, have had recourse\nto them in their disputes, and have been perfectly contented with their\ndecisions on the cases referred to them, as the fountains of justice\nand loyalty.\n\n\u2018And, most sovereign lord, that your power, justice, and the state of\nyour government may not suffer at present any wound or diminution,\nand that public affairs may be managed according to the principles\nof reason, in such wise as may be apparent to all men of sound\nunderstanding;--\n\n\u2018For this effect, most redoubted sovereign, we, the above-written, have\nconfederated and assembled, that we may most humbly lay before you the\nreal state of your situation, in regard to your royal person, and also\nthat of my lord of Acquitaine, your eldest son. We have likewise to lay\nbefore you the manner in which you are enthralled, and the government\ncarried on, that justice may be restored, and the public weal no longer\nsuffer, as we can more fully explain. Should any persons deny this,\nlet your majesty, by the advice of your council, appoint some of the\nprinces of your blood, and other impartial and unprejudiced persons,\nto inquire into it, in whatever number you in your wisdom may select.\nBut we advise that you speedily and effectually provide for the safety\nof your own person, and for that of my lord of Acquitaine, your eldest\nson, so that your state may enjoy justice and a good government, to the\nadvancement of the public welfare, and that the power and authority\nmay be exercised by you alone, freely and uncontrolled by any other\nperson whatever; and that such a desirable object may be obtained, we,\nthe above-named, offer our earnest prayers, and, at the same time, our\nlives and fortunes, whatever they may be, which God has graciously\ngranted us in this world, for the just defence of your rights, and in\nopposing all who may attempt to infringe on them, if any such there be.\n\n\u2018Most redoubted lord, we also inform you, that we shall not break up\nour confederation until you shall have listened to us, and until we\nshall see that you have properly provided against the inconveniences\nwe have mentioned, and until you be fully and wholly reinstated in\nthat power which is your right. To this, most redoubted lord, are we\nbound, as well in regard to what we have already said, as from fear,\nhonour and reverence to our Creator, from whom originates your royal\nauthority, and also to satisfy justice, and then yourself, who are\nsovereign king on earth, and our sole lord. To your support we are\nurged by our kindred and by our love to your person; for in truth,\nmost redoubted sovereign, there is nothing we dread so much as having\noffended God, yourself, and wounded our own honour, by leaving for so\nlong time unnoticed the aforesaid grievances, which are notorious to\nevery one.\n\n\u2018In like manner as we signify the above to you, we shall do the same to\nall prelates, lords, universities, cities and principal towns of your\nrealm, and in general to all your wellwishers.\n\n\u2018Most redoubted lord, we humbly supplicate that you will deign to hear\nus, and consider of what we have written,--for the sole object we aim\nat personally affects yourself and your government; and we earnestly\nbeg that you will speedily adopt the most effectual measures for the\nenjoyment of your own freedom of action, and that your government may\nbe carried on to the praise of God first, and your own glory, and\nto the advantage of all your good subjects who are anxious for your\nwelfare.\n\n\u2018We have written this, that you may know our intentions, and the cause\nof our assembling, which is solely for the preservation of the personal\nliberty of our lord and king, and the affranchisement of his government\nfrom any hands but his own. For this object we have sought the advice\nof the most prudent men, and shall follow their counsels, with all the\nmeans God has put in our power, to obtain so desirable an end, for the\ngeneral welfare of the realm; and we intend so to act toward our lord\nthe king that God and the world shall be satisfied with us.\n\n\u2018And we most earnestly entreat that for so praiseworthy an object\nyou will join us, and exert yourselves in the same cause; for it is\nnot properly us but the king your lord that you will serve, whom by\nyour oaths you are bounden to assist,--and know that for so doing you\nwill be commended by all men of understanding and prudence. Given at\nChartres the 2d day of December, 1410.\u2019\n\nThis letter, when received by the council of the town of Amiens,\nproduced very little sensation,--for all, or the greater part of the\ninhabitants, were inclined to the duke of Burgundy. When a similar one\nwas read in the council of state, it did not make any impression on the\nking, nor did it seem advisable that the dukes should have an audience;\nbut, on the contrary, orders were sent to them to disband their forces\nwithout delay, on pain of incurring the royal indignation.----They\nrefused to obey this order, and bade the messenger tell the king,\nthat they would not cease assembling until he should grant them an\naudience, and hear their complaints. At this period, the dukes of\nAcquitaine and Burgundy paid a visit to the queen of France at her\nresidence in the castle of Melun, and left there a garrison, having\nbrought back with them the queen and her children to the castle of\nVincennes.\n\nThe duke of Brabant at this time left Paris, to go to his country, and\nassemble his Brabanters to serve the king. Many able ambassadors were\nsent, in the king\u2019s name, to the lords assembled at Chartres; and among\nthem was the grand master of Rhodes, to signify to them that they must\ndisband their army, and that, if they pleased to wait on the king in\ntheir private capacity, he would see them.\n\nThis they refused; and as they continued disobedient, the king took\npossession of the counties of Boulogne[64], Estampes, Valois,\nBeaumont, Clermont, and other lands belonging to the said dukes,\ncounts, and their adherents, of whatever rank they might be. The king\u2019s\nofficers appointed governors to the castles and fortresses within these\ncountries, whom they ordered to govern them at the expense of the\naforesaid lords.\n\nSo very numerous were the forces that assembled near Paris, in\nobedience to the summons from the king and the duke of Burgundy, that\nthe oldest persons had not for a long time seen so many men at arms\ntogether.\n\nAmong the number was the duke of Brabant, with a great force. He was\nquartered in the town of St Denis, where he lived at the expense of the\ngreater part of the inhabitants, as if he had been in the open country.\nThe count de Penthievre, son-in-law to the duke of Burgundy, was there\nwith him, accompanied by a large body of Bretons.\n\nTwo thousand men belonging to the count Waleran de St Pol were\nquartered at Menil-Aubry, and the adjacent villages.--Because the\ncount himself resided in Paris, he one day ordered his troops to be\nassembled under the lord de Chin, for him to march them to Paris to be\nmustered and enrolled for pay; but it happened, as they were marching\nthrough St Denis to obey the order, that a dispute arose between them\nand the Brabanters, on account of some enterprise which the last had\nmade against the lord de Carlian, a native of the Boulonois, so that\nthe two parties armed and drew up in battle-array to decide matters\nby combat. The duke of Brabant was soon informed of this tumult, and\nhastened from Paris to check his own men, and acted so prudently with\nboth parties that an end was put to it; but he was very wroth with the\nfirst promoters of it, for he was married to the daughter and heiress\nof the count de St Pol.\n\nWhen they had marched through Saint Denis, they came before their lord,\nthe count de St Pol, in Paris, who having reviewed them, and paid many\ncompliments to their captains, dismissed them to the quarters whence\nthey had come. In order to pay these troops which had been levied,\nas has been said, by orders from the king and the duke of Burgundy,\nand which amounted, by the muster-rolls, to fifteen thousand men with\nhelmets, seventeen thousand cross-bows and archers, very heavy taxes\nwere levied throughout the realm, and particularly on the city of\nParis. It will be impossible to relate one half of the mischiefs the\narmies of both parties committed: suffice it to say, that churches,\nchurchmen, and the poor people were very great sufferers.\n\nThe Orleans-party, shortly after this, marched from Chartres\nto Montlehery, seven leagues from Paris, and there, and in the\nneighbouring villages, quartered their army, ruining the whole country\non their line of march. The lords and adherents of this faction, as\nwell clergy as seculars, wore, as their badge, a narrow band of white\nlinen on their shoulders, hanging over their left arm, like to a deacon\nwhen celebrating divine service.\n\nWhen the king of France and his council learnt that they had approached\nso near the capital, they hastily dispatched to the leaders the count\nde la Marche, the archbishop of Rheims, the bishop of Beauvais, and the\ngrand master of Rhodes, with some others, to persuade them to disband\ntheir army, and come before him at Paris, in consequence of his former\norders, without arms, in the manner in which vassals should wait on\ntheir lords, and that he would do them justice in regard to their\ndemands; but that, should they refuse, he would instantly march his\nforces against them.--The princes made answer, that they would not\nact otherwise than they had said in their letter to the king; and the\nambassadors, seeing they could not gain any thing, returned to Paris.\n\nIn like manner, the university sent to them an embassy of learned\nmen, headed by Noe\u00e9tz, abbot of Povegny and doctor in divinity, who\nharangued them very ably and gravely. They were very handsomely\nreceived by the princes, especially by the duke of Berry, who, among\nother grievances, complained much that his nephew, the king, should be\ncounselled by such fellows as the provost of Paris, and others of the\nsame sort, who now ruled the realm, which was most miserably governed,\nas he was ready to explain, article by article, when they should be\nadmitted to an audience.\n\nThey could obtain no other reply than that, with God\u2019s pleasure, they\nwould accomplish, to the utmost of their power, the matters contained\nin their circular letters to the university and principal towns.\n\nOn this repeated ill success, the king, by the advice of his council,\nsent another embassy, composed of the queen, the cardinal de Bar, the\ncount de St Pol, and others. The count de St Pol had lately accepted,\nwith the king\u2019s approbation, the office of grand butler of France,\nwhich the provost of Paris had held, through the interest of the count\nde Tancarville, by a gift from the king.\n\nNotwithstanding the queen and her companions were received with every\nhonour, she did not remain with their army, but went to the castle\nof Marcoussi, which is not far distant from Montlehery, with her\nattendants, and remained there some time negotiating with them, and\nsome of the princes daily visited her. Although she acted with much\nperseverance, she failed in her object,--for the princes were firm in\ntheir resolution of marching with their army to the king, and requiring\nthat he would execute justice and attend to the affairs of government,\nand choose another set of ministers than those now in power.\n\nFinding she was labouring in vain, she returned with her companions\nto Paris, and related to the king all that had passed. He was very\nindignant, and much troubled thereat; and on the morrow, the 23d\nSeptember, he ordered all the men at arms that were come to serve him\nto be drawn out, and the baggage and artillery waggons to be made ready\ninstantly to march against the Orleans-party, to give them battle.\n\nWhen all were ready, and as he was going to attend mass and afterward\nto mount his horse, he was met by the rector of the university,\nmagnificently accompanied by all the members and supporters of it, who\nremonstrated with him, that his daughter, the university of Paris, was\npreparing to leave that city, from the great want of provisions, which\nthe men at arms of the two parties prevented coming to Paris,--for no\none could venture on the high roads without being robbed and insulted;\nand, likewise, that all the low countries round Paris were despoiled by\nthese men at arms. They most humbly requested, that he would provide\na remedy, and give them such answer as might seem to him good. The\nchancellor, namely, master Arnauld de Corbie, instantly replied, \u2018The\nking will assemble his council after dinner, and you shall have an\nanswer.\u2019 The king of Navarre, being present, entreated the king that he\nwould fix an hour for hearing them again after dinner; and the king,\ncomplying with his request, appointed an hour for the rector to return.\n\nWhen the king had dined, he entered the _chambre verde_, attended by\nthe following princes: the dukes of Acquitaine, Burgundy and Brabant,\nthe marquis du Pont, the duke of Lorraine, the counts de Mortain,\nde Nevers and de Vaudemont, with many other great lords, as well\necclesiastical as secular. The king of Navarre made four requests to\nthe king: first, that all the princes of the blood, as well on the one\nside as on the other, should retire to their principalities, and never\nmore interfere in the king\u2019s government, and likewise that henceforth\nthey should not receive any profits or pensions, as well from the\nsubsidies arising from their lands as from other exactions, but live\non their own proper revenues until the public treasury should be in\na better state than it was at that moment: however, should the king\nbe inclined to make them presents of any thing, or call them near his\nperson, they should be alway ready to obey him.\n\nHis second request was, that some diminution should take place in those\ntaxes that most aggrieved the people.\n\nThe third, that as some of the citizens of Paris had lent different\nsums of money to the king, of which repayment had been promised, but\nnot made, sufficient assignments on the treasury should be given to\nthem.\n\nThe fourth, that the affairs of the king and realm should be governed\nby prudent men, taken from the three estates of the kingdom. When the\nking of Navarre had ended, the king himself replied, and said he would\ntake advice on what he had proposed, and then give him such answers as\nought to satisfy him and every one else.\n\nWhen this was over, the king showed the same determination as before\nto march, on the morrow morning, against the rebellious lords; but he\nwas overruled, and the queen, with the former ambassadors, were again\nsent to negotiate a peace. On their arrival at the army of the princes,\nshe exerted herself, as it was said very much and loyally; for it was\ncommonly reported that she was in her heart inclined to the Orleans\nfaction.\n\nDuring the time of this embassy, the count Am\u00e9 de Savoye, who had been\nsent for by the king, arrived at Paris with five hundred men at arms.\nHis brothers-in-law the dukes of Burgundy and Brabant, and the count\nde Nevers, attended by many other lords, went out to meet him beyond\nthe gate of St Anthony, and thence conducted him to the palace to the\nking, who very kindly received him.\n\nSome days after, the queen, not having more success than before,\nreturned to the king, and told him that she could not any way bring\nthem to terms, for they were obstinate in their original intentions.\nShe then hastened to the castle of Vincennes as speedily as she could.\n\nOn the ensuing morning, the aforesaid lords quitted Montlehery; and\nthe duke of Berry came to his h\u00f4tel of Vinchestre[65], which he had\nrebuilt, and was there lodged. The duke of Orleans fixed his quarters\nat Gentilly, in the palace of the bishop, and the count d\u2019Armagnac at\nVitry; the rest as near to each other as they could; and at vespers,\nthey had advanced as far as the suburbs of St Marcel and the gate de\nBordelles.\n\nThe king, the duke of Burgundy, and the other princes, were greatly\nsurprised at this boldness; and the Parisians, at their own expense,\ncollected a body of a thousand men armed with helmets to serve as a\nguard during the night, and they also made great fires in very many of\nthe streets. To prevent them from crossing the Seine at Charenton, they\nsent two hundred men at arms to defend that pass.\n\nThe third day, Arthur count de Richemont, brother to the duke of\nBrittany, joined the dukes of Berry and Orleans, with six thousand\nbreton horse, to the great displeasure of the king, and especially of\nthe duke of Burgundy; for the duke of Brittany had lately been summoned\nby the king to attend him with his Bretons, and had, for this purpose,\nreceived a very large sum of money. The duke, in consequence, having\nother business in hand, sent his brother to serve the king in his room.\n\nIt was also said, that the lord d\u2019Albreth, constable of France, had\ndisposed of the money sent him in the same manner, and had employed it\nin the service of the duke of Berry. The army of the princes marched to\nSaint Cloud, and to the adjoining towns, which they plundered, taking\nby force whatever they were in need of. Some of the worst of them\nravished and robbed many women, who fled to Paris, and made clamorous\noutcries against their ravishers, requiring vengeance from the king,\nand restitution, were it possible, of what they had been plundered of.\n\nThe king, moved with pity, and by the importunity of his ministers,\nordered a decree to be drawn out, which condemned the whole of the\nOrleans-party to death and confiscation of goods. While this was doing,\nthe duke of Berry, uncle to the king, hastily sent ambassadors to\nParis to prevent it from taking effect, and in the name of their lord\nrequested that the decree might be a little delayed, when other means\nof accommodation, through God\u2019s grace, would be found.\n\nThis request was granted, and the proclamation of the decree put off:\na negotiation was entered into warmly by both parties, although the\nking was very much displeased that the princes of his blood were thus\nquarrelling with each other, so that he should be forced to proceed\nwith rigour against them. To prevent the effusion of blood, the king\ndesired his chancellor and others of his privy council to exert\nthemselves diligently that peace might be established; and he likewise\nspoke to the same purpose to the duke of Burgundy, the count de St\nPol, and other princes, who promised faithfully that an accommodation\nshould take place.\n\nWhile these matters were going on, the lord de Dampierre, the bishop\nof Noyon, the lord de Tignonville, master Gautier de Col, and others,\nambassadors from the king of France, were sent from Paris to Boulogne,\nto meet an embassy from the king of England, consisting of the lord\nBeaumont, the bishop of St David\u2019s, and others, who had arrived at\nCalais to treat of a truce. It was prolonged from All-saints-day, when\nthe former one expired, to the feast of Easter ensuing.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XXII.\n\n    IN CONSEQUENCE OF THE NEGOTIATIONS BETWEEN THE TWO PARTIES OF\n    BURGUNDY AND OF ORLEANS, PEACE IS MADE BETWEEN THEM, AND CALLED\n    \u2018THE PEACE OF WINCHESTER,\u2019 WHICH WAS THE SECOND PEACE.\n\n\nAfter the ambassadors from both parties, namely those of the king and\nduke of Burgundy on the one hand, and those of the dukes of Berry, of\nOrleans, and of Bourbon, on the other, had held several conferences,\nthe following treaty was at length concluded, on the 2d of November.\n\nThe princes of the blood on each side, with the exception of the count\nde Mortain, were to retire to their principalities, and lead back their\nforces, committing as little damage as possible to the countries they\nshould pass through, without fraud or deception. The duke of Berry had\nliberty, if he pleased, to reside at Giens-sur-Loire, and the count\nd\u2019Armagnac might stay there with him for fifteen days. The king of\nNavarre was to depart for his duchy of Nemours. The duke of Brabant\nmight, if he so pleased, visit his sister, the duchess of Burgundy, in\nthat country.\n\nThe aforesaid princes were to conduct their men at arms so that all\ntrespassing might be mutually avoided on each other\u2019s lands,--nor\nshould they suffer any of their adherents to commit waste or damage, so\nthat all inconvenience or source of quarrel might be avoided.\n\nItem, in whatever garrisons there shall be more men than are usually\nkept, the same shall be reduced to the accustomed number of men\nretained therein for its defence, without any fraud or deception. And\nthat these terms may be faithfully observed, the aforesaid lords shall\npromise, on their oaths, made before such princes as the king may\nnominate, that they will punctually and loyally keep every article.\n\nItem, the captains of their troops shall make oath also to the due\nobservance of this treaty; and if it be the good pleasure of the king\nhe may appoint some of his knights as conductors to the men at arms,\nand superintendents on their leaders, to prevent them and their men\nfrom delaying their march, and also from committing waste in the\ncountries through which they shall pass.\n\nItem, the aforesaid lords will not return near the person of the king,\nunless they be sent for by him, by letters patent under the great seal,\nconfirmed by his council, or on urgent business,--nor shall any of the\naforesaid lords intrigue to obtain orders for their return; and this\nthey shall especially swear to before commissioners nominated for the\npurpose. The king shall make the terms of this treaty public, and all\nthe articles they shall swear to observe.\n\nShould the king think it necessary to send for the duke of Berry,\nhe shall, at the same time, summon the duke of Burgundy, and _vice\nversa_; and this he will observe, in order that they may both meet at\nthe same time on the appointed day, which will hold good until the\nensuing Easter in the year 1411; and from that day until the following\nEaster in 1412, no one of the aforesaid shall proceed against another\nby acts of violence or by words.--Every article of this treaty to be\nproperly drawn out and signed by the king and his council, with certain\npenalties to be incurred on the infringement of any of them.\n\nItem, the king shall select certain able and discreet persons, of\nunblemished characters, and no way pensioners, but such as have solely\ngiven their oaths of allegiance to the king, to form the royal council;\nand when such persons have been chosen, a list of their names shall be\nshown to the princes on each side.\n\nItem, the dukes of Berry and Burgundy, having the wardship of the duke\nof Acquitaine, shall agree together as to the person who shall be their\nsubstitute in that office during their absence; and powers for so doing\nshall be sent to the duke of Berry, as he is at present without them.\n\nItem, the provost of Paris shall be dismissed from all offices which he\nholds under the king, and another shall be appointed according to the\nking\u2019s pleasure, and as he may judge expedient.\n\nItem, it was ordained, that no knight, or his heirs, should in future\nsuffer any molestation because he had not obeyed the summons sent him\nby either of the parties; and should they be any way molested, the king\nwould punish the offender by confiscation of his property. Letters,\nconfirming this last article, shall be given by the king and the\naforesaid lords to whoever may require them.\n\nThis treaty was concluded on All-saints day, and on the ensuing Monday\nconfirmed; and four days after, the greater part of the articles were\nfulfilled. Sir John de Neele, chancellor to the duke of Acquitaine,\nwas, by the king\u2019s command, appointed to receive the oaths of the lords\non each side.\n\nThe king dismissed his provost of Paris, sir Peter des Essars, knight,\nfrom all his offices, and nominated sir Brunelet de Sainct-Cler, one of\nhis masters of the household, to the provostship. He also sent letters,\nsealed with his great seal, to the duke of Berry, appointing him to\nthe guardianship of his son, the duke of Acquitaine.\n\nIn consequence of one of the articles above recited, twelve knights,\nfour bishops, and four lords of the parliament, were appointed to\ngovern the kingdom,--namely, the archbishop of Rheims, the bishops\nof Noyon and Saint Flour, master John de Torcy, lately one of the\nparliament, but now bishop of Tournay, the grand master of the king\u2019s\nhousehold sir Guichart Daulphin, the grand master of Rhodes, the\nlords de Montenay, de Toursy, de Rambures, d\u2019Offemont, de Rouvroy, de\nRumacourt, Saquet de Toursy, le vidame d\u2019Amiens, sir John de Toursy,\nknight to the duke of Berry, and grand master of his household, and the\nlord de St George. The two last were nominated, by the dukes of Berry\nand Burgundy, guardians to the duke of Acquitaine during their absence.\n\nThe two parties now left Paris and the adjoining fortresses and\ncastles; but on the following Saturday, the king was again strongly\nseized with his usual malady, and confined in his h\u00f4tel of St Pol. The\nqueen and her attendants, then at Vincennes, returned to Paris with her\nson, the duke of Acquitaine, and fixed their residence, with her lord,\nin the h\u00f4tel de St Pol.\n\nThe duke of Burgundy went to Meaux, where he was met by the king of\nNavarre;--and thence the duke went to Arras and Flanders, accompanied\nby sir Peter des Essars, late provost of Paris, and his most\nconfidential adviser; and he always gave him the title of provost of\nParis, as though he had still retained the office.\n\nConformably to the treaty, all the men at arms on each side returned\nto the places whence they had come, but plundering the poor people\non their march. A number of Lombards and Gascons had formed part of\nthe army of the duke of Orleans, who were mounted on terrible horses,\nthat were taught to wheel round when on full gallop, which seemed very\nastonishing to the French, Flemings, Picards, and Brabanters, who had\nnot been accustomed to such movements.\n\nBecause the count d\u2019Armagnac had joined the duke of Orleans with a\nlarge body, his men were called _Armagnacs_; and in consequence, the\nwhole of that faction were called _Armagnacs_. Although there were many\nprinces of much higher rank in either party than the count d\u2019Armagnac,\nthey were not pleased if they were not called by this name, which\nlasted a very considerable time.\n\nAs the treaty before mentioned had been concluded at the h\u00f4tel de\nWinchester, where the dukes of Berry and Orleans, with others of their\nparty were amusing themselves, it was called \u2018The Peace of Winchester.\u2019\n\nAll who had come to these meetings at Paris now departed, and those\nto whom the government had been intrusted remained near the person of\nthe king and the duke of Acquitaine. The people expected, that by this\nmeans they should enjoy more peaceable times; but it happened just the\ncontrary, as you shall shortly hear.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XXIII.\n\n    A MEETING OF THE UNIVERSITY AND CLERGY IS HELD ON THE XXIII. OF\n    NOVEMBER, IN THE CHURCH OF ST BERNARD AT PARIS, ON THE STATE OF\n    THE CHURCH.\n\n\nWhen peace had been established, a large congregation was held, by\norder of the university, on the 23d of November, in the church of\nthe Bernardins in Paris,--to which were called, the bishop of Puy\nin Auvergne, many other prelates, and in general all bachelors and\nlicentiates in canon and civil law, although in former times doctors\nonly had been summoned.\n\nThis assembly was holden at the request of the archbishop of Pisa,\nand other legates from the pope, on the subject of tythes, the vacant\nbenefices, and the effects of the dead. But it was opened by the\nadoption of a solemn ordinance, which had been ordained during the\npapacy of Pietro della Luna, respecting the liberties of the french\nchurch, in the year 1406, and since confirmed by the king, his great\ncouncil, and the parliament, namely, that the said church shall be\nmaintained in all its ancient privileges. It was thus freed from all\ntythes, procurations, and subsidies, or taxes whatever. And as the\nobject of these legates was to establish the above impositions, it was\nresolved that the aforesaid ordinance should be strictly conformed to;\nand the more effectually to have it observed, they sent deputations\nto the king, to his council, and to the parliament, to whom the guard\nof this ordinance belonged, to obviate the inconveniences that might\nfollow should any article of it be infringed.\n\nIt was also concluded, that should the legates attempt, by menaces of\necclesiastical censures or otherwise, to compel payment of any tribute,\nan appeal should be made from them to a general council of the church.\n\nItem, should any collectors or sub-collectors exact subsidies to\nthe church, they shall be arrested, and punished by confiscation of\nproperty, and, when they have no property, by imprisonment.\n\nIt was also concluded, that to settle this matter, the king\u2019s attorney,\nand other lords, should be requested to join the university. But it was\nat last resolved, that should the pope plead an evident want of means\nto support the church, a council should be called, and a charitable\nsubsidy granted, the which should be collected by certain discreet\npersons selected by the council, and the amount distributed according\nto the directions of the said council.\n\nOn the ensuing Monday was held a royal sessions, at which the duke of\nAcquitaine, the archbishop of Pisa, and the other legates from the\npope, the rector and the members of the university were present. In\nthis meeting, the archbishop declared, that what he demanded was due\nto the apostolic chamber, by every right, divine, canon, civil and\nnatural, and that it was sacred and simple justice,--adding, that\nwhoever should deny this right was scarcely a Christian.\n\nThe university was greatly displeased, and said, that such expressions\nwere derogatory to the king\u2019s honour, to that of the university, and\nconsequently of the whole kingdom. From what had passed, another\ngeneral assembly was holden on Sunday the 30th of November, in the\nplace where it had been held the preceding Sunday; and it was then\ndetermined that the university should send a deputation to the king,\nto lay before him the words uttered by the legates, and to demand that\nthey should be publicly recanted by them. It was proposed, that in case\nthey should refuse so to do, the faculty of theologians should bring\naccusations against them, on the articles of faith, and they should be\npunished according to the exigence of the case. It was also resolved,\nthat the university of Paris should write letters to all the other\nuniversities in the realm, and to the prelates and clergy, to invite\nthem to unite in their opposition to such tenets.\n\nMany other things were agitated in this meeting, which I pass over for\nthe sake of brevity. It was, however, finally concluded to send an\nanswer to the pope, that he could not have any subsidy granted him in\nthe way which had been proposed. The meeting came to the resolution,\nthat the university of Paris should require from the archbishop of\nRheims, and those of the members of the king\u2019s government who, as\nmembers, had given their oaths to the university, to join in the\nmeasures they had adopted, otherwise they should be expelled the\nuniversity.\n\nIt should be known, that while these things were passing, the legates,\nfearful of the consequences, hastily left Paris, without taking leave,\nas is usually done. The holy father, however, sent ambassadors to the\nking, to demand payment of the tenth imposed on the french church. When\nthey declared the object of their mission to the council of state, and\nin the presence of the duke of Acquitaine, they said, that not only\nwas the french church bound to pay this subsidy to the pope, but all\nother churches which were under his obedience,--first, from the divine\nlaw in Leviticus, which declares that all deacons shall pay to the\nhigh priest a tenth of their possessions,--and, 2dly, by natural and\npositive law.\n\nWhilst these things were passing, the university came to the council,\nand on the morrow a congregation was held in the monastery of the\nBernardins. It was then resolved that the manner of demanding this\nsubsidy should be reprobated, for that it was iniquitous, and contrary\nto the decree of the king and his council in the year 1406, for the\npreservation of the franchises of the french church. The university\ninsisted on this decree being preserved inviolate, and declared, that\nif the pope or his legates attempted to constrain any person to pay\nthis subsidy by censures of the church, it would appeal to a general\ncouncil on this subject. Should any of the new ministers attempt any\nthing against this decree, the university would appeal to the king and\nthe whole council of state; and should any members of the university\nurge the payment of this tenth, they should be expelled; and if any\npersons, guilty of the above offence, should have any property of their\nown, the university would require that the said property should be\nconfiscated to the king\u2019s use, otherwise they should be imprisoned.\n\nShould the holy father adopt the manner of raising this subsidy by\nway of charity, it would be agreeable to the university that the king\nshould call together the prelates of his realm,--first, to consider\nwhat subjects should be discussed in the general council of the church\nto be holden on this occasion; secondly, to deliberate on the demands\nmade by the ambassadors respecting the tenth. Should it be determined\nfor the pope to receive this subsidy, the university expressed its wish\nthat some sufficient person should be deputed from this kingdom to\nreceive the amount of the same, for the peace and union of the greek\nand latin churches, and from England for aid of the holy land, and the\npreaching the gospel to all the world; for such were the purposes for\nwhich the legates declared the holy father raised this subsidy. The\nuniversity solicited the members of the parliament to unite themselves\nwith them, for it was in support of their decree made on the demand of\nthe king\u2019s attorney-general.\n\nJuvenal des Ursins[66] was deputed by the university to reply to what\nthe pope\u2019s ambassadors had advanced before the council; but at length\nthe archbishop of Pisa, perceiving he could not otherwise gain his\nobject, humbled himself much before the university, and spoke privately\nto some of the principal members to prevail on them to assist him.\nHowever, on the 28th day of January, it was declared, that no subsidy\nwhatever should be granted to the pope without the previous consent of\nthe french church; and the deliberation on this matter was deferred to\nthe 10th of February, when many prelates were summoned to give their\nopinions thereon. Through the active diligence of the university, the\nlegates could not obtain consent that a subsidy in any shape should be\ngranted to the pope, although the greater part of the lords, and in\nparticular the princes, were very agreeable to it.\n\nWhile these matters were transacting at Paris, the holy father sent\nletters to the king of France and to the university, to say that\nthe Florentines refused any longer to obey him, from fear of king\nLadislaus; that this king Ladislaus was assembling an immense army,\nas the pope wrote word, to conquer Rome and the adjacent country,\nthat he might place in the chair of St Peter a pope according to his\npleasure. Should this happen, a more ruinous schism might befal the\nchurch than the former one,--to obviate which, he requested from the\nking, the princes, and university, aid and support. This was, through\nthe intercession of the archbishop of Pisa, complied with, and in the\nmanner that shall be hereafter related.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XXIV.\n\n    THE LORD DE CROY IS MADE PRISONER WHEN GOING ON AN EMBASSY\n    FROM THE DUKE OF BURGUNDY TO THE DUKE OF BERRY, TO THE GREAT\n    DISPLEASURE OF THE LATTER.\n\n\nThe duke of Burgundy, shortly after he had left Paris, sent three of\nhis counsellors, namely, the lords de Croy and de Dours, knights, and\nmaster Raoul, head canon of Tournay and of Amiens, licentiate of law,\nas ambassadors to the king at Paris, and to his uncle and godfather,\nthe duke of Berry, at Bourges. But when they were travelling between\nOrleans and Bourges, the lord de Croy was arrested by the officers\nof the duke of Orleans on the last day but one of January, without\nany molestation being given to the other two ambassadors or their\nattendants.\n\nHe was carried to a castle within three leagues of Blois, and, on the\nmorrow, strictly interrogated respecting the murder of the late duke\nof Orleans, and put to the torture to confess if he had been any way\nconsenting to it, or an accomplice in it; but they could not discover\nany thing to his prejudice. On the following Sunday, he was carried to\nBlois, and confined in the dungeons of a prison.\n\nThe other ambassadors continued their route to Bourges, where, having\nexplained to the duke of Berry the object of their mission, they humbly\nentreated that he would exert himself with the duke of Orleans that the\nlord de Croy might obtain his liberty. When they related to him the\nmanner of the lord de Croy being arrested, the duke was filled with\nindignation, and instantly sent letters signed with his hand to the\nduke of Orleans, to say that he must immediately give up his prisoner,\nwhom he had illegally arrested when coming to him; and that if he did\nnot do it, he would have him for his enemy.\n\nThe duke of Orleans, on the receipt of this letter, considered it well,\nand replied at length most courteously to the duke of Berry, excusing\nhimself for what he had done, but putting off the setting the lord de\nCroy at liberty. The king and the duke of Acquitaine were soon made\nacquainted with this arrest,--and they sent letters to the duke of\nOrleans, commanding him instantly to deliver the lord de Croy from his\nimprisonment, on pain of incurring their indignation.\n\nNotwithstanding these letters, the duke of Orleans would not give him\nhis liberty, but kept him in close confinement, where he was very often\nmost rigorously treated, and at times examined and put to the torture.\n\nIn the mean time, the other ambassadors sent messengers to the duke of\nBurgundy, to notify to him this conduct and the means they had taken in\nvain for the deliverance of the lord de Croy.\n\nThe duke was much surprised and vexed at this news, for he greatly\nloved the lord de Croy. Having considered this insult, and others that\nhad been offered to his friends, he thought it time to take effectual\nmeasures for his security, and in consequence amassed as large a sum as\nhe could: to this end, he sold his right to all confiscations within\nthe town of Ghent to the townsmen, and yielded for money several other\nprivileges to the Flemings. He likewise carried his son, the count\nde Charolois, to show him to many of the principal towns as their\nfuture lord, who, on this occasion, made him considerable presents. He\nafterward held a grand council on his affairs, in the town of Tournay,\nwhich was attended by his brothers-in-law duke William and the bishop\nof Liege. The count de Namur was also present, and several great lords\nfrom the borders of the empire. The duke of Burgundy solicited their\naid against his enemies, should need be, and in particular against\nthe duke of Orleans, his brothers and allies. This service they\noffered him liberally, to the utmost of their power. Having obtained\ntheir promises, he went to Lille, whither the marshal Boucicaut, late\ngovernor of Genoa, came to meet him. He received him very kindly, and\ncarried him with him to his town of Arras, whither he had convoked all\nthe lords and nobles of the county of Artois and its dependancies.\n\nWhen they were assembled in the great hall of his residence, he\naddressed them himself, and caused them to be harangued by master\nWilliam Bouvier, knight, licentiate of law, to explain how his enemies\nwere plotting daily to arrest and imprison his friends, and had\nactually arrested and imprisoned the lord de Croy; for which cause he\nhad now assembled them, to request that they would remain loyal, and\nthat, should there be a necessity, they would enter into his pay and\nserve him,--for they might be assured it would be solely in his own\ndefence, and for that of the king and the duke of Acquitaine, that\nhe would ever take up arms. He declared, that it was merely for the\npreservation of the crown to his present majesty, and to his heirs,\nthat he had slain the duke of Orleans, father to the present duke.\nThis death had been lately pardoned, and peace established by the\nking in the town of Chartres, and proclaimed by letters patent. He\nadded, that should any of the conditions of that treaty of Chartres be\nunaccomplished by him, he was ready to fulfil them, and willing to do\nany thing else that would afford satisfaction.\n\nWhen he had concluded his speech, the nobles and knights present\nunanimously replied, that they would serve him to the utmost of their\npower. The meeting then broke up, and each man returned to his own\ncountry and home.\n\nThe marshal Boucicaut went to Paris, and in full council, presided\nby the duke of Acquitaine in the place of his father, he accused the\nGenoese of various crimes, and exculpated himself for having lost that\ntown; and ended by entreating, that he might be sufficiently supplied\nwith men and money to offer them battle and regain it.\n\nThe council deferred giving an answer at the moment, but appointed a\nday for him to receive it. In the mean time, Boucicaut waited on all\nthe principal lords, to interest them in his cause, and to beg that\nthey would press the king and council to hasten a compliance with his\nrequest. It was ordered by the council, conjunctively with the three\nestates, that the Genoese should be summoned to appear before them at\nParis, at the feast of Easter, when many of the nobles would be there\nassembled on other weighty affairs, particularly to have their consent\nthat the duke of Acquitaine should be appointed regent of the kingdom,\nfor the Parisians were extremely pressing that this should be done.\n\nThe duke of Berry, however, was much displeased when he heard of it,\nand, to prevent it, wrote urgent letters to the duke of Acquitaine, to\nthe queen, and to the great council, giving substantial reasons why\nthis could not and ought not to be done, considering how very young the\nduke of Acquitaine was,--adding, that he and his brother Philip duke of\nBurgundy, of good memory, had sworn on the holy sacrament that they\nwould support and defend, to their last drop of blood, their nephew,\nthe king now on the throne, against all who should attempt any thing to\nhis dishonour or disadvantage.\n\nWhile these things were in agitation, the king recovered his\nhealth,--and of course, the duke of Acquitaine was not regent, to the\ngreat satisfaction of the duke of Berry, who was much rejoiced thereat.\n\nIn consequence of the quarrel that had now again broken out between the\ndukes of Orleans and Burgundy, the king issued a proclamation to all\nthe bailiwicks, provostships, seneschalships and governments in his\nrealm, to forbid all nobles, of whatever rank they might be, and every\nother person, to obey the summons or join in arms either of the above\ndukes, under pain of their property being confiscated.\n\nOn the Wednesday of the holy week, the duke of Bourbon and the count\nde Vertus, brother to the duke of Orleans, marched five hundred men at\narms to Clermont in Beauvoisis, and thence invaded Normandy. The count\nde Vertus did not remain long there, but, taking a part of the men at\narms, left the duke of Bourbon, and hastened to the countries of the\nSoissonnois and Valois, to the territory of Coucy, which belonged to\nhis brother, and there placed a good garrison.\n\nTrue it is, that when the duke of Burgundy heard this, he was much\ntroubled, and, as speedily as he could, ordered his men at arms to meet\nhim at Ch\u00e2teau-Cambresis the last day but one of April. But when these\ntransactions came to the knowledge of the king and council, he sent\nable ambassadors to each of these dukes, to forbid them, under pain of\nhaving all their lands confiscated, and being declared enemies to their\nking and country, to attempt any expeditions against each other, and\ncommanded them instantly to disband their forces. For this time they\nvery humbly obeyed his orders, and deferred proceeding further for a\nconsiderable space.\n\n\n\n\n[A. D. 1411.]\n\nCHAP. XXV.\n\n    THE DUKE OF ORLEANS SENDS AMBASSADORS TO THE KING OF FRANCE,\n    WITH LETTERS OF ACCUSATION AGAINST THE DUKE OF BURGUNDY AND\n    THOSE OF HIS PARTY.\n\n\nAt the commencement of this year, the duke of Orleans was displeased\nthat those ministers who had been nominated by the duke of Burgundy had\ngreater influence than any of the others, and that they daily deprived\nsuch as had been attached to the late duke of Orleans, and were now\nhis friends, of their offices. In consequence, he sent ambassadors\nto the king to complain of this conduct, and to require that the\nmurderers of his father should be punished conformably to the articles\nof the treaty, but who were now residents within the kingdom. To these\nambassadors promises were made, on the part of the king, that proper\nremedies should be applied to give them satisfaction.\n\nOn their departure, the king sent to his uncle, the duke of Berry, at\nBourges, to require that he would interfere between his two nephews of\nOrleans and Burgundy, and make peace between them, which he engaged\nto do; and in consequence, he sent his chancellor, the archbishop of\nBourges, to Paris, well instructed by the duke how he was to act.\n\nShortly after, this chancellor, the marshal Boucicaut, with others,\nwere dispatched to the duke of Burgundy, then at St Omer, who, having\nheard all they had to say, replied, that it was no fault of his, nor\nshould it ever be so, that any articles of the late treaties were\ninfringed; for that in this, and in every thing else, he was very\ndesirous of obeying the king. And this his answer they laid before the\nking and council.\n\nBut as the proceedings against the murderers of the late duke of\nOrleans did not seem to his son, and his advisers, to be carried on\nwith sufficient vigour, he wrote letters, signed with his own hand, to\ncomplain of this and other matters to the king, the contents of which\nwere as follows:\n\n\u2018Most redoubted lord, after offering my humble recommendation,--lately,\nvery redoubted lord, two of your counsellors came to me, namely, sir\nCollart de Charleville, knight, and sir Simon de Nanterre, president of\nyour parliament, whom you had been pleased to send me to signify and\nexplain your good will and pleasure touching certain points, which they\nhave clearly and distinctly declared, according to the terms of their\ncommission.\n\n\u2018First, they require and entreat of me, in your name, who may command\nme as your loyal subject and humble servant, that I should submit the\nquarrel that subsists between me and the duke of Burgundy, for the\ninhuman and cruel murder of my very redoubted lord and father, and your\nown brother, on whose soul may God have mercy! to my lady the queen,\nand to my lord and uncle the duke of Berry, who has been in like manner\nsolicited by your ambassadors to labour diligently to establish a firm\npeace, for the general good of the kingdom.\n\n\u2018They have informed me, that you have also made a similar proposal to\nthe duke of Burgundy,--and that, to effectuate so desirable an object\nas peace, I should send four of my friends to my said uncle of Berry,\nwho will there meet the same number from the duke of Burgundy.\n\n\u2018The second point mentioned by them is, that you entreat I would desist\nfrom assembling men at arms.\n\n\u2018Thirdly, that I would accept of letters from you similar to those\nwhich had been formerly sent me at my request, respecting the\nmurderers, and their accomplices, of my late father and your brother.\n\n\u2018Having very maturely weighed and considered the above points, I reply,\nthat I most humbly thank you, very redoubted lord, for your grace and\nkindness in thus sending to me; and I can assure you, that I have no\ngreater pleasure than in hearing often from you, and of your noble\nstate; that I was, and am always ready to serve and obey you in body\nand fortune, to the utmost extent of my own and my subjects\u2019 abilities.\n\n\u2018But as the matters which they have mentioned to me in your name are\nof very high consideration and importance, concerning yourself and\nyour noble state, and as I shall ever be most anxious to show my ready\nobedience to your will, I was unable at the moment to make them any\nreply, excepting that I would send you an answer as speedily as I\ncould. This I have hitherto deferred, for I know you have near your\nperson, and in your council, several of my bitter enemies, whom you\nought to regard as yours also, and to whom I am unwilling that my\nanswer, or my future intentions, should be made known: neither is it\nright they should be made acquainted with what concerns me, or have the\nopportunity of giving their opinions in council, or elsewhere, relative\nthereto.\n\n\u2018I therefore assure you, most redoubted lord, in the fullest manner,\nthat I am your humble son and nephew, ready at all times to obey you\nas my sovereign lord, and most heartily anxious to honour and exalt to\nthe utmost of my power your crown and dignity, as well as that of the\nqueen, the duke of Acquitaine, and all your other children and kingdom,\nand to advise you most loyally and faithfully, without ever concealing\nany thing from you that may tend to the glory of your crown, or to the\nwelfare of your realm.\n\n\u2018I have some time hesitated to denounce to you such of my enemies, and\nyours also, as are in your council and service, namely, the bishop of\nTournay, the vidame d\u2019Amiens, John de Neelles[67], the lord de Heilly,\nCharles de Savoisy, Anthony des Essars, John de Courcelles, Peter de\nFontenay and Maurice de Railly, who, by force or underhand means, are\ncapable of doing me great mischief, insomuch that they have dismissed\ncertain very able men from their offices, who were your trusty\nservants, and have done them very great and irreparable damages: they\nare guilty also of insinuating very many falsehoods, to keep myself and\nothers, your relations and faithful servants, at a distance from you,\nby which, and other means equally dishonourable and iniquitous, long\nfollowed by them and their adherents, have they troubled the peace of\nthe kingdom: nor is it very probable that so long as such persons shall\nremain in power, and in your service, any firm or lasting peace can be\nestablished; for they will always prevent you from doing justice to\nmyself or to others, which ought indifferently to be done to all,--to\nthe poor as well as to the rich.\n\n\u2018This conduct they pursue, because they know themselves guilty of many\ncrimes, and especially John de Neelles and the lord de Heilly, who were\naccomplices in the murder of my late honoured father, and your only\nbrother, under the protection of the duke of Burgundy, the principal\nin this crime. They are his sworn servants and pensioners, or allies\nto the said duke, whence they may be reputed actors and accomplices in\nthis base and cowardly assassination. These accomplices, most redoubted\nlord, appear daily in your presence, and you ought to consider their\ncrimes in the same light as if done personally against you, for indeed\nyour authority was set at nought.\n\n\u2018That I may now say all that I know, I am satisfied, that had not the\ncourse of your justice been checked by the aforesaid persons and their\naccomplices, ample justice would have been done for the death of my\nlord and father, and your brother, with the aid of your officers and\nloyal subjects, as I know for certain that they were well inclined to\nit.\n\n\u2018For this I am very thankful; and I most earnestly pray you, for your\nown honour, for that of the queen and of the duke of Acquitaine, as\nwell as for the honour of your kingdom, that you would do good and fair\njustice, by causing these guilty persons to be arrested and punished,\nsince they are equally your enemies as mine,--and that you would not\nlonger admit to your presence and councils the partisans of the duke of\nBurgundy, but select in their places good, loyal, and able men, such as\nmay be found in abundance in your kingdom.\n\n\u2018When these things shall be done, I will then, under God\u2019s pleasure,\nsend you such answer, that you may clearly know my inmost thoughts, and\nwhich shall prove satisfactory to God, to yourself, and to the world.\nFor the love of God, I pray you, my most redoubted lord, do not neglect\ndoing this; otherwise I see plainly, that whatever supplications or\nrequests I make to you will never be attended to, although they be\nconformable to reason and justice, and that you will be prevented from\nacting in the manner you have proposed, through your ambassadors to me,\nnor shall I be able to do what they have required from me on your part.\n\n\u2018Therefore, my most redoubted lord, I beg you will not disappoint\nme; for what I have required is but just and reasonable, as will be\napparent to any one. My very dear lord, may it please you to order me\naccording to your good pleasure, and, with the will of God, I will obey\nyou faithfully in all things.\u2019\n\nWhen the duke of Orleans had sent this letter to the king, he wrote\nothers of the like tenour to the chancellor of France, and to such\nof the ministers as he knew were favourable to him, to entreat that\nthey would earnestly exert themselves in pressing the king, queen, and\nduke of Acquitaine, to dismiss those of the council who governed under\nthe name of the duke of Burgundy, and whose names have been already\nnoticed,--and that he might obtain justice on the murderers of his\nlate father. Notwithstanding the many attempts he made by repeated\nletters to the king and to others, he could not at that time, through\nthe interposition before mentioned, obtain any answer which was\nsatisfactory.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XXVI.\n\n    THE DEATH OF THE DUKE OF BAR.--THE KING OF FRANCE SENDS AN\n    EMBASSY TO THE DUKE OF BURGUNDY,--AND OTHER MATTERS.\n\n\nIn this year died that valiant and wise man Henry duke of Bar, and was\nsucceeded by his eldest son Edward, marquis du Pont, in the duchy of\nBar and castlewick of Cassel, excepting a part which he had bequeathed\nas an inheritance, after his decease, to Robert de Bar, son to the\ndeceased Henry de Bar, his eldest son, and to the lady de Coucy,\nnamely, Varneston, Bourbourg, Dunkirk and Rhodes[68]. In consequence\nof his death, Edward was styled Duke of Bar, and began his reign\nprosperously.\n\nAt this period, the king of France sent ambassadors to the duke of\nBurgundy, who, beside what they delivered to him in speech, gave\nhim the letters which the duke of Orleans had written to the king,\ncontaining his charges against him and his accomplices. He was much\ndispleased at this conduct, and made reply by these ambassadors, that\nthe charges brought against him by the duke of Orleans were untrue.\nWhen he had received the ambassadors with every honour, he took leave\nof them, and went to his county of Flanders: and they returned to\nParis without any satisfactory answer to the matters concerning which\nthey had been sent.\n\nIt was not long before the duke of Burgundy raised a large body of men\nat arms, whom he sent into the Cambresis, and toward St Quentin; but\nimmediately after, by orders from the king and council, he dismissed\nthem to the places whence they had come.\n\nOn the 15th day of July, master John Petit, doctor of divinity, whom\nthe duke of Orleans had intended to prosecute, before the university\nof Paris, for heresy, died in the town of Hesdin, in the h\u00f4tel of\nthe hospital which the duke of Burgundy had given him, beside large\npensions, and was buried in the church of the Friars Minors in the town\nof Hesdin.\n\nAt this time, a tax was laid on the clergy of France and of Dauphiny,\nof half a tenth, by the pope, with the consent of the king, the\nprinces, and the university of Paris, and the greater part of the\nprelates and cities, to be paid by two instalments; the first on\nMagdalen day, and the second at Whitsuntide following. It was so\nrigorously collected that the poorer clergy complained bitterly.\n\nDuring this transaction, and while the duke of Burgundy was resident\nin his town of Bruges, on Saturday the 10th of July, sir Am\u00e9 de\nSarrebrusse, sir Clugnet de Brabant, and other captains of the duke of\nOrleans, came, with a numerous body of men at arms, before Coucy, in\nthe Vermandois, and Ham sur Somme.\n\nNews of this was soon carried to the duke of Burgundy, who, suspecting\nthey intended to invade and make war on his territories, gave\ncommissions to several of his captains, namely, the lord de Heilly,\nEnguerrand de Bournouville, the lord de Ront, and some others, to march\na body of men at arms towards Bapaume and Ham, to oppose the Armagnacs,\nshould they attempt to penetrate further into the country.\n\nDuring this time, the duke of Orleans and his brothers continued their\nsolicitations for justice, and again sent letters to the king, princes,\ncities, and prelates, to engage them to unite with them in obtaining\nthe object of their petitions. The tenour of the letter they wrote to\nthe king is as follows.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XXVII.\n\n    THE DUKE OF ORLEANS AND HIS BROTHERS SEND LETTERS TO THE KING\n    OF FRANCE, TO OTHER LORDS, AND TO SEVERAL OF THE PRINCIPAL\n    TOWNS IN FRANCE, TO COMPLAIN OF THE DUKE OF BURGUNDY.\n\n\n\u2018Most redoubted and sovereign lord,--we Charles duke of Orleans,\nPhilip count de Vertus, and John count of Angoul\u00eame, brothers, your\nvery humble children and nephews, have, with all due humiliation\nand submission, considered it right to lay before you, jointly and\nseparately, what follows.\n\n\u2018Although the barbarous and cruel murder of our redoubted lord and very\ndear father, your brother, must for certain be most strongly impressed\non your royal memory, and engraven on your heart,--nevertheless, most\nredoubted lord, our grief and the sense of what is due to us from all\nlaws, human and divine, force us to renew in your memory all the minute\ntransactions of that inhuman event.\n\n\u2018It is a fact, most dear lord, that John, who styles himself duke\nof Burgundy, through a hatred he had long nourished in his breast,\nand from an insatiate ambition and a desire of governing your realm,\nand that he might have the office of regent, as he has clearly shown\nand daily continues to show, did, on the 14th day of November in the\nyear 1407, most treacherously murder your brother, our most renowned\nlord and father, in the streets of Paris, and during the night, by\ncausing him to be waylaid by a set of infamous wretches, hired for this\npurpose, without having previously testified any displeasure towards\nhim. This is well known to all the world; for it has been publicly\navowed by the traitorous murderer himself, who is more disloyal, cruel,\nand inhuman than you can imagine; and we do not believe you can find in\nany writings one of a more perverse or faithless character.\n\n\u2018In the first place, they were so nearly connected by blood, being\ncousins-german, the children of two brothers, that it adds to his crime\nof murder that of parricide; and the laws cannot too severely punish\nso detestable an action. They were also brothers in arms, having twice\nor thrice renewed this confederation under their own hands and seals,\nand solemnly sworn on the holy sacrament, in the presence of very many\nprelates and nobles, that they would be true and loyal friends,--that\nthey would not do any thing to the prejudice of each other, either\nopenly or secretly, nor suffer any such like thing to be done by others.\n\n\u2018They, besides, entered into various protestations of love and\nfriendship, making the most solemn promises to continue true brothers\nin arms, as is usual in such cases, to demonstrate that they felt a\nperfect friendship for each other; and as a confirmation of their\naffection, they mutually wore each other\u2019s colours and badges.\n\n\u2018Secondly, he proved the perverseness of his heart by the manner in\nwhich this murder was committed. Under cover of his pretended affection\nfor your aforesaid brother, he conversed frequently with him; and once\nwhen he was ill, a short time before his death, he visited him at his\nhouse of Beaut\u00e9 sur Marne, and in Paris, showing him every sign of love\nand friendship that brother, cousin, or friend could testify,--when,\nat the same time, he had plotted his death, had sent for the murderers\nto Paris, and had even hired the house to hide them in, which clearly\ndemonstrates the wickedness and disloyalty of his heart.\n\n\u2018In addition to what I have just stated, and the very day before the\nmurder took place, after the council which you had held at the h\u00f4tel\nde St Pol was broken up, they both, in your presence and before the\nother princes of the blood who were there, drank wine and ate together;\nand your brother invited him to dine with him the Sunday following.\nThe duke of Burgundy accepted the invitation, although he knew what\na diabolical attempt he harboured in his heart, and that it would be\nput into effect the very first favourable opportunity. This is an\nabomination disgraceful even to relate.\n\n\u2018On the morrow, therefore, notwithstanding all his fair promises and\noaths, being obstinately bent upon his wicked purpose, he caused him to\nbe put to death with more cruelty than ever man of any rank suffered,\nby those whom he had hired to waylay and murder him, and who had, for\na long time, been watching their opportunity. They first cut off his\nright hand, which was found the next day in the dirt: they then cut his\nleft arm so that it held only by the skin, and, beside, fractured and\nlaid open his skull in several places that his brains were scattered\nin the street; and they then dragged his body through the mud, until it\nwas quite lifeless.\n\n\u2018It would be pitiful to hear of such barbarous conduct towards the\nmeanest subject: how much the more horror must the recital cause, when\nit was practised on the first prince of the blood of France! Never was\nany branch of your noble race so cruelly and infamously treated,--and\nyou and all of your blood, and such of your subjects as wish you well,\nought not to suffer such a lamentable deed to be perpetrated without\nany punishment or reparation whatever, as is the case till this present\ntime, which is the most shameful thing that ever happened, or ever\ncould happen, to so noble a house; and additional disgrace will fall\nupon it, if you any longer delay justice.\n\n\u2018Thirdly, he shows his perverseness and obstinacy by false and damnable\nhypocrisy; for after the horrid deed had been done, he came with the\nother princes dressed in black, to attend the body, pretending the\nutmost grief at the funeral for the loss of his brother in arms,\nthinking by this means to cover the wickedness of his sin. It would be\ntiresome to relate all the damnable and hypocritical arts he employed\nto hide the treacherous and murderous part he had acted, until he\nperceived that his crime must be brought to light by the diligence of\nyour officers of justice.\n\n\u2018He then, and then only, confessed to the king of Sicily, and to the\nduke of Berry, that he had perpetrated this murder, or at least had\ncaused it to be committed; and that the devil had tempted him to do\nit, for that in truth he could not assign any other cause for having\nso done. But he was not contented with murdering his body: he wanted\nagain, so great is his iniquity, to murder his fame and fair reputation\nby false and wicked accusations, when he was no more able to defend\nhimself against them. The falsehood of these charges, through the grace\nof God, is notorious to you and to the whole world.\n\n\u2018My late most redoubted lady-mother, whose soul may God receive!\nsuffered the utmost tribulation, not only for the death of her\nmuch-beloved lord and husband, but also for the inhuman and cruel\nmanner of it; and like one in despair, attended by me, John of\nAngoul\u00eame, she waited on you, as her king and sovereign lord, and\nher sole refuge in this her distress, and most humbly supplicated\nthat you would, out of your benign goodness, have compassion on her\nand her children, and would order such prompt and just judgment to\nbe executed on the perpetrators of this murder as the blackness of\nthe case required; and as you are bound in your quality of king to\nadminister strict justice to all your subjects without delay, as well\nto the poor as to the rich, so rather the more promptly ought you to\nexercise it in favour of the poor and deserted than for the rich and\npowerful; for this upright administration of justice is a great virtue,\nand on this account were kings chiefly appointed, and power intrusted\nto their hands. The case that was then and is now again brought before\nyou requires the most speedy justice; for it not only concerns you as\nking, but affects you more sensibly and personally,--for her husband,\nour much regretted lord, who was so treacherously slain, was your only\nbrother, and, consequently, strict justice ought to have been granted\nto her, and done on the murderers.\n\n\u2018You did indeed appoint a day for doing her this justice; on which\naccount, she constantly employed her agents near your person, to\nremind you thereof: she waited long after the appointed day had elapsed\nfor the judgment which you had promised her,--and, notwithstanding all\nher diligence and exertions, she met with nothing but delays, caused by\nthe means of the aforesaid traitor, his friends and adherents, as shall\nbe more fully explained hereafter.\n\n\u2018However, most redoubted lord, I know for certain, that your\ninclinations were very willing to do us justice, and that they still\nremain the same. Our most afflicted mother, attended by me Charles of\nOrleans, again returned; and we renewed our request to have judgment\nexecuted on the assassins of our late lord and father. We also caused\nto be most fully detailed before my lord of Acquitaine, your eldest\nson, and by you commissioned as your lieutenant on this occasion, and\nbefore the queen, every circumstance relative to the murder, and the\ninfamous charges urged by way of exculpation by the murderer, and the\ncauses why he had committed this atrocious crime. We, at the same time,\nfully replied to what had been argued in his defence; and after this,\nour lady-mother caused conclusions to be drawn against the aforesaid\ntraitor, according to the usual customs of your reign, and required\nthat your attorney should join with her in the further prosecution of\nthe criminals, so that they might be brought to justice.\n\n\u2018When this was done, our very redoubted lord the duke of Acquitaine,\nby the advice of the princes of your blood and divers others of your\ncouncil, then present at the Louvre, made answer to our lady-mother,\nthat, as your lieutenant, he and the princes of the blood, and\nthe members of your council, were satisfied, and pleased with the\njustifications offered by our lady-mother in behalf of your brother,\nour much redoubted father, whose soul may God pardon! and that they\nconsidered him as fully innocent of the charges brought against him,\nand added, that substantial justice should be done to her satisfaction.\n\n\u2018Notwithstanding all these promises, there was much delay in their\nexecution, insomuch that she frequently renewed her solicitations\nto you, the princes of your blood, and to your council, and used\nvarious other means to obtain justice, the recital of which would\ntire you: nevertheless, she could never gain the assistance of your\nattorney-general in prosecuting the aforesaid criminals to judgment,\nwhich circumstance is lamentable to think on.\n\n\u2018For the aforesaid traitor, well knowing your inclination to execute\njustice, knowing also that his crime could by no means be justified, in\norder to prevent matters being pushed to extremity, (notwithstanding\nyour positive orders to him, to forbid his appearing at Paris, with any\nbody of men at arms) came thither with a powerful force, composed of\nforeigners, and several who had been banished your realm, who did great\nmischief to the countries through which they passed, as is notorious to\nevery one.\n\n\u2018Your and our lady the queen, with the duke of Acquitaine, your son\nand heir, and the princes of the blood, were forced to quit your\ncapital before he arrived there. He remained, therefore, in your\ntown of Paris lord paramount, and conducted himself in a tyrannical\nmanner, subversive of your dominion, and contrary to the interests\nof the people. To avoid greater inconveniences and oppressions on\nyour subjects from him and his men at arms, it was judged expedient\nthat you, the royal family and council of state should, according to\nhis good pleasure, come to Chartres, and there grant him whatever\nhe should ask. Thus he thought he should be acquitted of all the\ntraitorous acts and murders which he had committed, by trampling your\njustice under his feet. Consequently he refuses to suffer any of your\nofficers to take cognizance of his crimes, and has not condescended to\nhumiliate himself before you, whom he has troubled and offended more\nthan can be told. He is not, therefore, capable of receiving any grace\nby law or reason; nor worthy of being admitted to your presence, and\nhaving any favours shown to him or to his dependants and friends. He\nshould have presented himself before you in all humility and contrition\nfor his offences; whereas he has done precisely the contrary, and has\nso obstinately persisted in his wickedness that he has had the boldness\nto avow to yourself publicly, and before so great an assembly as met at\nChartres, that he put your only brother to death for your welfare and\nthat of the state.\n\n\u2018He wishes also to maintain, that you told him you were not displeased\nthat it had been done. This has shocked every loyal ear that has heard\nit, and will shock still more the generations to come, who shall read\nand learn that a king of France (the greatest monarch in Christendom)\nshould not have been displeased at the most inhuman and traitorous\nmurder of his only brother.\n\n\u2018This is so manifestly treason of the deepest die against your\nown honour, and that of your crown and kingdom, that scarcely any\npunishments ordered by law and justice are capable of making reparation\nfor it. It is also greatly prejudicial to the far-famed justice of your\ncourts of law.\n\n\u2018Notwithstanding the excuses which he made to you, that the murder\nof your brother had been committed for your personal security, and\nthe good of your kingdom, it is notorious, that it had been plotted\na very long time, through his immeasurable ambition of obtaining the\ngovernment of your realm, as I have before stated. He has declared to\nseveral of his dependants and officers, that there never before was\ncommitted in this country so base a murder; and yet, in his defence, he\nsays it was done for the public good, and for your personal safety.\n\n\u2018It is therefore very clear, according to law and equity, that every\nthing done at Chartres on that day is null and void; and what perhaps\nis as deserving of punishment as the commission of the crime itself\nis, that he never deigned to pay you any honour, respect, or condolence\nfor such a loss as that of your brother, nor ever once solicited\npardon, or any remission for his offence whatever. And he wishes to\nmaintain, that without confessing his guilt, and without demanding\npardon, you have remitted all further proceedings against him, which is\ncontrary to all equity and written laws,--a mere illusion, or rather a\nderision of justice, namely, thus to leave a murderer, without taking\nany cognizance of his crime, without penitence or contrition, and\nto prosecute no inquiry into his conduct, and, what is worse, when\nsuch a criminal obstinately perseveres in his wickedness, even in the\npresence of his sovereign lord. On that same day, however, he fell\ninto a manifest and apparent contradiction; for he says that he has\ndone well, and consequently he assumes to himself merit, and requires\nremuneration,--and, nevertheless, he pretends to say that you have\ngiven him pardon and remission, which circumstance implies not good\ndeeds and merit, but a crime and offence.\n\n\u2018He has never offered any prayers for the salvation of the soul of the\ndeceased, nor any remuneration to those who have suffered from the\nloss caused by him; and this you ought not, and cannot in any manner\npardon.\n\n\u2018Thus it clearly appears, that what was done at Chartres was contrary\nto every principle of law, equity, reason and justice; whence it again\nfollows, that from this, and other causes too long to be detailed, all\nthe proceedings at Chartres are null and of no effect. Should any one\nmaintain, that the treaty made at Chartres is good and binding, it may\nvery easily be shown, that this aforesaid traitor has infringed the\narticles of it in various ways, and has been the first to violate it.\n\n\u2018Although you had ordered, that henceforth he should in no way act to\nour prejudice, and although he had sworn to observe it,--nevertheless\nhe did directly the contrary; for, thinking to damn the good fame of\nour very redoubted lord and father, he caused your grand master of\nthe household, whose soul may God receive! to be arrested, thrown\ninto close imprisonment, and inhumanly tortured, so that his limbs\nwere broken, and made him suffer other martyrdom that he might,\nthrough the severity of torture, force him to confess that our\never-to-be-regretted lord and father, and your only brother, whose\nsoul may God pardon! was guilty of some of the charges which he had\nfalsely brought against him, so that his crimes might be excused, and\nthat he might for ever destroy the honour of our family.\n\n\u2018He had the grand master carried to the place of execution, who there,\nwhen death was before his eyes, declared, on the damnation of his soul\nif he told a falsehood, that he had never in his life seen any thing\ntreasonable in the conduct of the late duke of Orleans, or any thing\nthat tended to the hurt of any individual,--but that he had always most\nloyally served you: and should he have said any thing to the contrary\nwhen under torture, it must have been his sufferings that forced him to\nutter what he thought would please his tormentors. What he now said was\nthe real truth, and he uttered it on the peril of damnation; and this\nhe persevered in to the moment of his execution, in the hearing of many\nknights and other respectable persons.\n\n\u2018This plainly demonstrates, that the duke of Burgundy\u2019s conduct was\nprecisely the reverse to what he had sworn to observe when at Chartres.\n\n\u2018He has received into his h\u00f4tel and supported, and continues daily\nso to do, the murderers who slew your brother, although they were\nespecially excepted out of the treaty concluded at Chartres. He\nlikewise, as is notorious, troubles the officers and servants of our\nlate lord and father, who now appertain to us, and dismisses them from\nall the employments which they held under your government, without any\nother cause whatever but his hatred to us and to our house, and to\nthose servants who are attached to us. He even attempted not only to\nruin them in their fortunes, but to take away their lives by means too\ntedious to relate; but the facts are notorious.\n\n\u2018The traitor, therefore, sensible of the horror of his criminal\ncruelty, and that he could not by any means palliate it, has usurped\nthe government of your kingdom (for the sole cause of his murdering\nyour brother was his unbounded ambition),--and, by so doing,\neffectually prevents your officers of justice from taking cognizance\nof his crimes, and likewise creates infinite grief to all your loyal\nsubjects and wellwishers.\n\n\u2018He detains your royal person, as well as that of my lord the duke of\nAcquitaine, in such subjection that no one, however high his rank, can\nhave access to you, whatever may be his business, without first having\nobtained permission from those whom he has placed around you, and has\nthus driven from you and your family several faithful and valiant\nservants long attached to you, and filled their places with his own\ncreatures, and in great part with foreigners and persons unknown to\nyou. In like manner, he has acted toward my lord of Acquitaine.\n\n\u2018He has also displaced your officers,--in particular, such as held\nthe principal posts in your realm; and as for your finances, he has\nlavished them here and there according to his will and pleasure, but\ngreatly to his own advantage, and not at all for the good of yourself,\nor for the relief of your people, which has caused much discontent\nagainst you. The underlings in office he has sorely vexed, under\nfeigned pretences of justice, and has robbed them of their fortunes,\nwhich he has applied to his own proper use, as is well known throughout\nParis and elsewhere.\n\n\u2018In short, he has introduced such a licentiousness of manners into the\nkingdom that all sorts of crimes are committed, without inquiry or\npunishment following them; and thus, from default or neglect of justice\nbeing done on this enormous and detestable murderer, many other murders\nhave been committed with impunity in different parts of the realm,\nsince the melancholy death of our much-regretted lord and father,\nmurderers and other criminals saying, \u2018Our crimes will be passed over,\nsince no notice has been taken of him who slew the king\u2019s brother.\u2019\n\n\u2018On this account, most redoubted lord, my lord of Berry your uncle,\nthe duke of Bourbon, the count d\u2019Alen\u00e7on, the counts de Clermont and\nd\u2019Armagnac, and I Charles of Orleans, wishing to testify our loyalty to\nyou, as we are bound by parentage, and being your very humble subjects,\nhad intended coming to you last year to lay before you the damnable\ngovernment of your kingdom, and to remonstrate, that should it continue\nlonger, it must end in the destruction of yourself, your family, and\nyour realm.\n\n\u2018In order, therefore, that you may hear us as well as such as may\nmaintain the contrary, let there be chosen a sufficient number of\ndiscreet men to examine into the grievances we complain of; and let a\nremedy be applied to them, providing first for the security of your\nroyal person, and for that of my lord of Acquitaine. This was more\nfully explained in the proclamations issued previously to our coming\nto Paris, when, for our personal safety, we were accompanied by our\nfriends and vassals, all of them your subjects; and our only object in\nthus coming was the welfare of yourself and your kingdom.\n\n\u2018We offered to wait on you with very few attendants, but we could\nnever obtain access to you, nor have a single audience, through the\nobstructions of this traitor, who was alway by your side; and he alone\nprevented the goodness of our intentions being made known to you,\nfrom his persevering ambition and his boundless desire of seizing the\ngovernment of yourself and realm.\n\n\u2018We, therefore, finding all hopes of seeing you fruitless, in\nconsequence of agreements concluded with your council, returned home;\nbut to avoid, if possible, the destruction of your country, we must\nagain confederate.--We faithfully observed all the articles of the\nagreement; but we were no sooner at a distance than our enemy violated\nthem in the most essential part. It had been settled that your new\nministry should be composed of men of unblemished characters, who were\nnot partisans or servants, or pensioners to either side; but he has\nkept those that were attached to him in power, so that he has now a\nmajority in the council, and consequently rules more despotically and\nmore securely than when he held the reins of government in his own hand.\n\n\u2018These grievances are increasing, and will increase, unless God shall\ndirect your mind to provide a remedy to them.\n\n\u2018Pierre des Essars, who had been provost of your good town of Paris,\nand minister of finance, was to be deprived of these offices, and of\nevery employment he held under your name. This was done for a short\ntime,--but he has since obtained for him, by letters sealed with\nyour great seal, a re-appointment to the provostship, under pretence\nof which the said Pierre des Essars has returned to Paris, and has\nattempted by force to execute the duties of that office. He came, in\nfact, to the court of the Ch\u00e2telet, seated himself on the judgment\nseat, and took possession of his office with the knowledge and\nconnivance of the duke of Burgundy,--and it was not his fault, if he\nfailed in success.\n\n\u2018Hence it appears plainly, that the late arrangements have been by\nhim, and those of his party, violated; and that he never had any real\nintentions of keeping the treaty is clear from his having consented to\nthe dismission of Pierre des Essars, and then secretly procuring his\nrestitution. It was also stipulated in this treaty, that all who had\nbeen deprived of their offices for having been in the company of me,\nCharles d\u2019Orleans, and the other lords, at the h\u00f4tel of Winchester,\nshould be restored to them; and that, by your orders, and those of your\ncouncil, sir John de Charencieres was to be replaced in his government\nof your town and castle of Caen,--nevertheless, the duke of Burgundy,\nin opposition to these your orders, had him displaced, and solicited\nthe appointment for himself, from hatred to sir John de Charencieres,\nand, having obtained it, now holds it, which is another infringement of\nthe treaty.\n\n\u2018Notwithstanding, most redoubted lord and sovereign, all the diligence\nand exertions made by our much-loved mother, whose soul may God\npardon! to obtain justice on the murderers of our late very dear\nfather, four years have now elapsed without any judgment being passed\non such enormous criminals, although she pursued every means in her\npower.\n\n\u2018In consequence of this failure or neglect, I, Charles of Orleans, have\nof late most humbly supplicated you to grant me warrants against these\naforesaid murderers, addressed to all your justices, that they might,\non due examination of the charges, imprison and punish, according to\nthe exigency of the case, all or any who may have been implicated in\nthis abominable crime. In this I made not any extraordinary request;\nfor justice is due to all your subjects, and cannot be refused them:\nyou cannot believe that any man, however low his rank, in your kingdom,\nwould have a similar request neglected by your courts of justice, for\nI know it could not be refused. However, in spite of every exertion I\ncould make, I have never yet been able to obtain these warrants, the\nreason of which is, as I suppose, that some of your new ministers are\nimplicated in the crime I am anxious to have punished, and therefore\nwill not suffer such warrants to be issued.\n\n\u2018For this reason, therefore, most redoubted lord, have I of\nlate earnestly supplicated you, that you would, from personal\nconsiderations, and for the good of your realm, dismiss from your\nservice the persons named in my letter,--for I therein charged them\nwith having obstructed public justice and disturbed the peace of the\ncountry. When this should be done, I declared to your ambassadors,\nthat I was willing, from my love to your person and attachment to your\nkingdom, to make publicly known my future intentions, and that my\nconduct should be such as would have the approbation of God and of your\nmajesty; but notwithstanding this, I have not yet had any satisfactory\nanswer to all my repeated solicitations for justice on the murderers of\nmy late regretted lord and father.\n\n\u2018We, therefore, most redoubted lord, again make our petitions that the\naforesaid criminals may be brought to that justice which is due to them\nfor the enormity of their offences; the principal having made a public\nconfession of his guilt in the presence of my lord of Acquitaine, who\npresided, in your absence, at the meeting held at his request in the\nh\u00f4tel de St Pol, and before a numerous body of the nobility, clergy\nand others; and the traitor cannot deny that this his confession was\nmade before a competent judge, and in the presence of such witnesses as\nthe king of Sicily and my lord of Berry your uncle.\n\n\u2018He had before privately confessed to these two persons, that he had\ncommitted the murder without any cause whatever, but through the\ninstigation of the enemy of mankind. This confession, according to\nevery law, ought to be to his prejudice, nor should he be suffered to\noffer any excuse in extenuation of a crime thus publicly and privately\navowed; for he has condemned himself, and ought to have judgment passed\non him accordingly.\n\n\u2018It is very apparent, that such confession requires not any further\nproceedings but the passing of that sentence which the enormity of the\ncrime deserves. Notwithstanding this, our much-regretted lady-mother\nand ourselves have never been able, with all our exertions, to overcome\nthe premeditated delays to obstruct justice; for three years and a half\nare elapsed since we first brought the matter before you, and we are\nnot one step more advanced to the attainment of judgment than we were\nthen. It is painful to consider what may be the consequence of this\nwilful delay of justice to the welfare of your kingdom, and that the\nmost dangerous consequences may ensue, unless a speedy and decisive\nremedy be applied.\n\n\u2018May it therefore please your grace to do your loyal duty, in executing\nthis act of justice, in obedience to God your Creator, to whom judgment\nappertains, and from whom you hold your authority. Have regard also to\nthe good government of your realm, and exert yourself to put an end\nto every obstacle in the way of a just punishment on the traitor. We\nmost earnestly supplicate you to comply with this our request as soon\nas possible, for we are bounden to press you to it, to the utmost of\nour powers, under pain of not being reputed the children of our late\nlamented father, and of being disgraced, and unworthy of bearing his\nname and arms, and of succeeding to his honours and estates: such\ndishonour we will never endure, but would rather suffer death, as ought\nto be the determination of every man of noble heart, of whatever rank\nor estate he may be.\n\n\u2018We therefore entreat you, with all possible humility, that for this\npurpose, and also in order to resist and oppose his wicked intention\nto destroy us by any means whatsoever, it may please you, from your\nbenignant grace, to aid, assist and abet by your power, us to whom\nGod hath vouchsafed so great favour as to cause us to be born your\nrelations, even of your own kin, and your true nephews, children of\nyour only brother,--or, to speak more properly, assist your only\nbrother, who has fallen a martyr to the ambitious views of this\ntraitor. Most redoubted lord, there is no man so poor, who, having had\nhis brother murdered, will not prosecute the murderer to death, and\nthe more earnestly as the criminal displays greater obstinacy. This is\nexemplified in the conduct of our traitor; for it is notorious, that he\nhas dared to write, and to declare to many respectable persons, that he\nslew your brother, whom God pardon! our much-redoubted lord and father,\nfairly and meritoriously. In answer to which, I Charles of Orleans say,\nthat he lies, and I at present decline to make a more ample reply,--for\nit is very manifest, as I have before explained, that he is a liar, and\na false disloyal traitor, and that, through the grace of God, I am, and\never will be without reproach, and a teller of truth.\n\n\u2018Since, therefore, such things cannot fail of being very prejudicial to\nyour realm and to the public welfare, we beseech you most humbly to do\nus that justice which you are bounden to do, and to assist us by every\nmeans in your power, that we may have full and ample reparation for the\nwrongs done us and our family, and that this murder may be punished in\nthe manner it deserves. In acting thus, you will acquit yourself toward\nGod our Creator, and execute justice, of which you are the supreme\nhead, to whom we must have recourse after God.\n\n\u2018That you, our most redoubted lord, may be assured that the contents of\nthis letter are from our free will and knowledge, we, Charles, Philip\nand John, your most humble children and nephews, have each of us signed\nit with our own hands. Written at Gergeau, the 10th day of July, in the\nyear 1411.\u2019\n\nThis letter was sent, by a herald of the duke of Orleans, to the king\nat Paris, and was laid before the whole of the council, where different\nopinions were held as to the contents. Some wished that the brothers\nshould have their requests complied with, and that the duke of Burgundy\nshould be summoned, that they might hear what he had to say in his\ndefence to the charges which they should make against him. But at\nlength the business was postponed, and the duke of Orleans could not\nobtain any favourable answer; for the greater part of those who ruled\nthe king and the duke of Acquitaine were favourers of the duke of\nBurgundy, to whom they shortly after sent a copy of the above letter.\n\nThe duke of Burgundy, on reading it, was convinced that the family of\nOrleans and their friends would very soon declare war against him;\nand in consequence, he immediately began to make every preparation to\noppose them, by forming magazines of stores, and engaging a numerous\nbody of men at arms, in various parts of his possessions.\n\nThe duke of Orleans and his brothers had not only written to the king\nof France, and to the princes of the blood, but also to the principal\ntowns, making complaint against the duke of Burgundy, and requiring\ntheir support. When they perceived that the king and his ministers did\nnot intend to answer their letter, they again wrote to the great towns,\ngiving them to understand, that if redress were not granted them in the\nlegal manner, as they had demanded it, they should seek other means of\nobtaining it.\n\nIt was now ordered by the king, the queen, and the duke of Berry,\nand others of weight in the council, that measures should be adopted\nfor appeasing the quarrels of the dukes of Orleans and of Burgundy.\nAmbassadors were sent to each of the parties, but without success,\nprincipally because the duke of Burgundy would not condescend to make\nany other reparation than what had passed at the treaty of Chartres;\nand his pride was increased by having the king and the duke of\nAcquitaine on his side.\n\nThe Orleans-party were much discontented, but not dismayed; for many\nvery considerable lords were with them, and had promised them aid and\nsupport against the duke of Burgundy to the utmost of their powers. The\nqueen, therefore, and the others employed to negotiate a peace between\nthe two factions, finding their attempts fruitless, gave it up, and on\na certain day made a report to the king of what they had done, and the\nanswers they had received from both parties. Shortly after, the duke\nof Orleans and his faction resolved to make mortal war on the duke of\nBurgundy and his allies, and sent him their challenges by a herald.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XXVIII.\n\n    THE DUKE OF ORLEANS AND HIS BROTHERS SEND A CHALLENGE TO THE\n    DUKE OF BURGUNDY, IN HIS TOWN OF DOUAY.\n\n\nThe following is the tenour of the challenge sent by the three brothers\nof Orleans to the duke of Burgundy, in consequence of the murder of\ntheir late father, the duke of Orleans.\n\n\u2018Charles, duke of Orleans and of Valois, count of Blois and of\nBeaumont, and lord of Coucy, Philip count of Vertus, John count of\nAngoul\u00eame, brothers,--to thee, John, who callest thyself duke of\nBurgundy.\n\n\u2018For the very horrible murder by thee committed (in treacherously\nwaylaying by assassins) on the person of our most redoubted lord and\nfather, Louis duke of Orleans, only brother to my lord the king, our\nsovereign and thine, in spite of all the divers oaths of brotherhood\nand fellowship thou hadst sworn to him; and for the numberless\ntreacheries and disloyal acts that thou hast perpetrated, as well\nagainst our sovereign lord the king as against ourselves, we thus\nacquaint thee, that we shall make war upon and distress thee and thine\nby every possible means in our power.\n\n\u2018And we appeal to God and justice against thy disloyalty and treason,\nand call for the assistance of every worthy man in this world. In\ntestimony whereof, and to assure thee of its truth, we have subjoined\nthe seal of me Charles of Orleans to these presents. Given at Gergeau,\nthe 18th day of July.\u2019\n\nThe above letter was delivered to the duke of Burgundy by a herald\nin his town of Douay, who, having considered its contents, wrote the\nfollowing answer, which he sent by one of his heralds at arms to the\naforesaid brothers.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XXIX.\n\n    THE DUKE OF BURGUNDY SENDS AN ANSWER TO THE CHALLENGE OF THE\n    DUKE OF ORLEANS AND HIS BROTHERS.\n\n\n\u2018John duke of Burgundy, count of Artois, of Flanders, palatine of\nBurgundy, lord of Salines and of Malines,--to thee Charles, who stylest\nthyself duke of Orleans and Valois,--and to thee Philip, who signest\nthyself count of Vertus,--and to thee John, who callest thyself count\nof Angoul\u00eame, who have lately sent me your letters of defiance.\n\n\u2018We make known to you, and to all the world, that to put an end to the\nabominable treasons and mischiefs that were daily plotted in various\nways, against the person of our sovereign lord and king, and against\nall his royal offspring, by Louis your father, and to prevent your\nfalse and disloyal father from succeeding in his abominable designs\nagainst the person of our and his most redoubted lord and sovereign,\nwhich were become so notorious that no honest man ought to have\nsuffered him to live, more especially we who are cousin-german to\nour lord the king, dean of the peerage, and twice a peer[69], felt it\nincumbent on us not to permit such a person longer to exist on the\nearth, and, by putting an end to his life, have done pleasure to God,\nand a most loyal service to our sovereign lord, in destroying a vile\nand disloyal traitor.\n\n\u2018And since thou and thy brothers are following the detestable traces\nand felony of your said father, thinking to succeed in the aforesaid\ndamnable attempts, we have received your challenge with great gladness\nof heart. But in regard to the charges therein made against us, we\ndeclare ye have falsely and wickedly lied, like disloyal traitors as\nye are; and with the assistance of our sovereign, who is perfectly\nwell acquainted and satisfied with our loyalty and honour, and for the\nwelfare of his people, we will inflict that punishment on you as such\nabandoned traitors and wicked rebels are deserving of. In witness of\nwhich, we have had this letter sealed with our seal. Given at our town\nof Douay, the 14th day of August, in the year 1411.\u2019\n\nThis answer, as I have before said, was carried by one of the duke of\nBurgundy\u2019s officers at arms to Blois, and there delivered to the duke\nof Orleans and his brothers, who were very indignant at the expressions\ncontained therein. He nevertheless entertained the bearer well, and,\nhaving maturely considered the matter, exerted himself to the utmost in\ncollecting men at arms to wage war on the duke of Burgundy.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XXX.\n\n    THE DUKE OF BURGUNDY IS DISCONTENTED WITH SIR MANSART DU\n    BOS.--HE SENDS LETTERS TO REQUIRE THE ASSISTANCE OF THE DUKE OF\n    BOURBON.\n\n\nWhen the duke of Burgundy was convinced that he could not avoid war\nwith the family of Orleans and their adherents, for several of them had\nchallenged him by letters and otherwise, he vigorously applied himself\nto collect forces to resist them. Among those who had sent him letters\nof defiance, he was more displeased with sir Mansart du Bos, a knight\nof Picardy, than with any of the rest; but of him, and his end, more\nshall be said hereafter.\n\nHe wrote a letter to the duke of Bourbon, which he sent by Flanders\nking at arms, the contents of which were as follow:\n\n\u2018Very dear and well-beloved cousin, duke of Bourbon and count of\nClermont,--John duke of Burgundy, count of Artois, Flanders and\nBurgundy, hopes he remains well in your good memory. In the year 1405,\nyou and he formed certain alliances, which, three years ago, were,\nat your request, renewed and again sworn to, in the presence of many\nknights and of other persons well deserving credit. In consequence, you\nwere to remain my good and true friend during your life, to promote to\nthe utmost my welfare and honour, and to ward off any evil from me, as\na sincere relation is bound to do; and likewise, whenever any thing\nshould affect my own honour, or that of my friends, you were bound\nto assist them or me, to the utmost of your abilities, in council or\nin arms, and to aid me with money and vassals against all the world,\nexcepting only the persons of my lord the king and of my lord of\nAcquitaine, or whoever may succeed to the throne of France, and of my\nlate fair cousin, the duke of Bourbon, your father.\n\n\u2018Should it have happened that a war took place between me and any\nenemy, whose side the late duke of Bourbon embraced, in that case you\nmight have joined your late father, but only during the course of\nhis life, without any way derogating from the articles of our said\nalliance. Now, as we both have most solemnly sworn to the observance\nof this alliance on the holy evangelists of God, and on sacred relics\ntouched by us, to the damnation of our souls in case of failure, I\ninform you, very dear and well-beloved cousin, that Charles, who calls\nhimself duke of Orleans, in conjunction with Philip and John, his\nbrothers, have sent me a challenge, and intend to wage war on me to the\nutmost of their power; but I hope, through the will of God, and the\nassistance of my friends and allies, in council and in arms, and with\nthe aid of my subjects and vassals, to make a successful defence of my\nhonour against their attempts.\n\n\u2018And since, very dear and well-beloved cousin, you have so solemnly\nbound yourself to assist me on every lawful occasion, I now,\ntherefore, in virtue of this alliance, require and summon you to come\npersonally to my aid, attended by as many of your friends and men\nat arms as you can collect, in opposition to the aforesaid Charles,\nPhilip and John, and thus honourably acquit yourself of your oaths and\npromises,--knowing, at the same time, that on a similar occasion I\nwould accomplish every article of my oaths, without any fraud whatever.\nAnd this I hope you will do.--Have the goodness to write to me by the\nreturn of the bearer, to inform me of your pleasure and intentions, as\nthe necessity of the case requires it.\n\n\u2018Given at my town of Douay, and sealed with my great seal appendant to\nthese presents, the 14th day of August, in the year 1411.\u2019\n\nThis letter was delivered by the aforesaid herald to the duke of\nBourbon, who, having fully read and considered its contents, replied\nto the herald, that he would speedily send his answer to the duke of\nBurgundy. This he did; for in a few days he returned the articles of\nconfederation, which he had formed with the duke of Burgundy, declaring\nthem annulled, and strictly united himself to the duke of Orleans and\nhis brothers, to the great displeasure of the duke of Burgundy, but\nwho at that time could not redress it.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XXXI.\n\n    A ROYAL PROCLAMATION IS ISSUED, THAT NO PERSON WHATEVER BEAR\n    ARMS FOR EITHER OF THE PARTIES OF THE DUKES OF ORLEANS OR OF\n    BURGUNDY.--THE LATTER WRITES TO THE BAILIFF OF AMIENS.\n\n\nThe duke of Burgundy, fearful that many of his friends would desert\nhim, in obedience of the royal proclamation which had been made in\nevery town and bailiwick through France, strictly commanding all\npersons whatever not to interfere, or in any manner to assist the\ndukes of Orleans and Burgundy in their quarrels with each other, wrote\nletters to the bailiff of Amiens, to his lieutenant, and the mayor and\nsheriffs of that place, and to each of them, the contents of which were\nas follows:\n\n\u2018Very dear and well-beloved,--we have heard from several of the\ndeclaration of my lord the king, by which you are forbidden, as well\nas all his other subjects, to arm in our defence, or in that of our\nadversaries. This proclamation has been issued by our lord the king,\nbecause he was very desirous of establishing peace and concord between\nus and our enemies; and for this purpose he had many times sent his\nambassadors as well to them as to us, to which we have alway replied\nlike a true and loyal subject and servant; and, through God\u2019s mercy,\nall our answers have tended to a good end, and to peace and union,\nwhich has made them perfectly agreeable to our lord the king. But our\nadversaries having persisted in the same damnable and wicked purposes,\nwhich they have ever followed against the peace of my lord the king,\nhis noble family, and the public welfare, by continuing to tread in\nthe footsteps of their father, who, for a long time, persevered in\nhis intentions of destroying my lord the king and his family, have\nacted quite contrariwise, and sent answers full of dissimulation and\ntreachery, with the sole design of gaining time.\n\n\u2018Whilst our much-redoubted lady the queen of France, our very dear\nlord and uncle the duke of Berry, and our very dear brother the duke\nof Brittany, were endeavouring, according to the king\u2019s orders, to\nnegotiate a peace between us and our adversaries, these false and\ndisloyal traitors, and disobedient subjects, Charles, who calls himself\nduke of Orleans, and his brothers, sent to us their challenges, and,\nbefore that time, have often scandalously, and in violation of their\noaths, defamed our person and character as they had before done. This,\nhowever, under God\u2019s pleasure, will fail in having any effect, for he\nwho knows all hearts is acquainted with the steady love and attachment\nwe bear, and shall bear so long as we live, to our lord the king and\nto his family, and to the welfare of his kingdom; and we shall ever\nsupport the same with all the worldly possessions and powers that God\nhas bestowed upon us.\n\n\u2018With these views we have done and commanded such acts as have been\ndone, without paying regard to the scandalous defamations that have\nbeen thrown out against us, or any way fearing a diminution of honour\nby such false, wicked, and disobedient traitors to our lord the king,\nas the aforesaid Charles and his brothers, the issue of that infamous\ntraitor, their father, so notorious throughout the realm.\n\n\u2018In truth, we hold it not to have been the intention of our lord the\nking to prevent any of our relatives, friends, allies, subjects, and\nwell-inclined vassals, from joining us, in the defence of our honour,\nagainst our enemies, and to defend our countries from invasion.\n\n\u2018We therefore entreat of you, and require most affectionately, that\nyou will please to allow such as may be inclined to serve us, who live\nwithin your bailiwick, and all others of our friends who may travel\nthrough it, to pass freely without any molestation whatever; for you\nmay be assured, that what we shall do will be for the welfare and\nsecurity of my lord the king, his family, and the whole kingdom, to the\nconfusion of all disloyal traitors.\n\n\u2018Should there be any thing that we could do to give you pleasure,\nyou have but to signify it to us, and we will do it with our whole\nheart.--Very dear and good friends, may the Holy Spirit have you under\nhis care! Written in our town of Douay, the 13th day of August.\u2019\n\nThese letters were very agreeable to Ferry de Hangest, then bailiff of\nAmiens, and to the others to whom they had been addressed, for they\nwere well inclined to favour the duke of Burgundy.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XXXII.\n\n    THE PARISIANS TAKE UP ARMS AGAINST THE ARMAGNACS.--A CIVIL WAR\n    BREAKS OUT IN SEVERAL PARTS OF FRANCE.\n\n\nAt this time the king of France, who had for a considerable time\nenjoyed good health, relapsed into his former disorder; on which\naccount, and by reason of the discontents that prevailed throughout\nthe kingdom, (the seat of government had been transferred to Melon,)\nthe butchers of Paris, who have greater power and privileges than any\nother trade, suspecting that the government of the realm, through\nthe intrigues of the queen and the provost of merchants, named\nCharles Cudane, would be given to the dukes of Berry and Brittany, in\npreference to the duke of Acquitaine, the king\u2019s eldest son, waited\nupon the latter, and exhorted him, notwithstanding his youth, to assume\nthe government for the good of the king and kingdom, promising him\ntheir most loyal aid until death. The duke of Acquitaine inclined to\ntheir request, and granted them their wishes.\n\nThis done, they ordered it to be proclaimed by sound of trumpet in all\nthe squares of Paris, that the provost of merchants, and others in\nParis, who were numerous, and whom they suspected of being favourable\nto the dukes of Berry, Bourbon, and Brittany, and to their parties,\nmust quit the town before a fixed day, under pain of suffering death.\nIn consequence of this proclamation, twelve persons, men and women,\nwithout including the domestics of the above lords, left Paris; and\nshortly after, the duke of Brittany, hearing of these commotions, took\nleave of the queen at Melun and retired into his duchy.\n\nThe butchers, and those who lived near the market-places, with the\ngreater part of the Parisians, were strong partisans of the duke of\nBurgundy, and very desirous that only he, or those that were of his\nparty, should govern the kingdom; and, to say the truth, it was now\nbecome dangerous for the nobility, of whatever party they might be, to\ndwell in Paris, for the common people had great sway in its government.\n\nIn the mean time, the duke of Orleans and his allies were strengthening\nthemselves, by every means in their power, with men at arms. The duke\nof Bourbon and the count d\u2019Alen\u00e7on came in these days with a numerous\nbody before the town of Roye in the Vermandois, which belongs to the\nking of France, and entered it about mid-day, more through fraud than\nby force of arms, for the townsmen did not suspect any warfare. When\nthey had dined, they sent for the principal inhabitants, and ordered\nthem, whether it were pleasing to them or otherwise, to receive a\ngarrison from them. They then rode to Nesle, in the Vermandois,\nbelonging to the count de Dammartin, wherein they also placed a\ngarrison.\n\nThence they dispatched sir Clugnet de Brabant, who had joined them, sir\nManessier Guieret, and other captains well attended, to the town of\nHam in the Vermandois, belonging to the duke of Orleans: they returned\nby Chauni sur Oise, where they also left a garrison, and in many other\nplaces, as well belonging to themselves as to others attached to their\nparty.\n\nThe duke of Bourbon, on his arrival from this expedition at his town\nof Clermont, strengthened it, and all his other towns in that country,\nwith fortifications. When the garrisons had been properly posted,\nthe war suddenly broke out between the two parties of Armagnacs and\nBurgundians.\n\nThe duke of Burgundy had not been idle in fortifying his towns with\ngarrisons, and in collecting men at arms to resist his adversaries: he\nhimself was in Flanders making preparations to march an army to offer\nthem battle. The army of the Armagnacs had already made incursions into\nArtois, and had done much mischief to friend and foe, by carrying off\nprisoners and great plunder to the garrisons whence they had come. The\nBurgundians were not slow in making reprisals, and frequently invaded\nthe county of Clermont and other parts.\n\nWhen by chance the two parties met, the one shouted \u2018Orleans!\u2019 and\nthe other \u2018Burgundy!\u2019 and thus from this accursed war, carried on in\ndifferent parts, the country suffered great tribulation.\n\nThe duke of Burgundy, however, had the king on his side, and those also\nwho governed him: he resided in his h\u00f4tel of St Pol in Paris, and the\ngreater part of its inhabitants were likewise attached to the duke of\nBurgundy.\n\nAt that time, the governors of Paris were Waleran count de St Pol and\nJohn of Luxembourg[70], his nephew, who was very young, Enguerrand\nde Bournouville, and other captains. They frequently made sallies,\nwell accompanied by men at arms, on the Armagnacs, who at times even\nadvanced to the gates of Paris. They were particularly careful in\nguarding the person of the king, to prevent him from being seduced by\nthe Orleans-party, and carried out of the town.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XXXIII.\n\n    SIR CLUGNET DE BRABANT IS NEAR TAKING RETHEL.--HE OVERRUNS THE\n    COUNTRY OF BURGUNDY.--OTHER TRIBULATIONS ARE NOTICED.\n\n\nSir Clugnet de Brabant, who always styled himself admiral of France,\none day assembled two thousand combatants, or thereabout, whom he\nmarched as speedily as he could from their different garrisons, to the\ncountry of the Rethelois, having with them scaling ladders and other\nwarlike machines. They arrived at the ditches of the town of Rethel\nabout sun-rise, and instantly made a very sharp assault, thinking to\nsurprise the garrison and plunder the town. The inhabitants, however,\nhad received timely notice of their intentions, and had prepared\nthemselves for resistance as speedily as they could.--Nevertheless,\nthe assault lasted a considerable time with much vigour on both sides,\ninsomuch that many were killed and wounded of each party.\n\nAmong the latter was sir Clugnet de Brabant, who, judging from the\ndefence which was made, that he could not gain the place, ordered\nthe retreat to be sounded; and his men marched into the plain,\ncarrying with them the dead and wounded. He then divided them into two\ncompanies; the one of which marched through the country of the Laonnois\nto Coucy and Chauni, plundering what they could lay hands on, and\nmaking all prisoners whom they met on their retreat.\n\nThe other company marched through part of the empire, by the county of\nGuise, passing through the Cambresis, and driving before them, like\nthe others, all they could find, especially great numbers of cattle,\nand thus returned to the town of Ham sur Somme and to their different\ngarrisons.\n\nWhen they had reposed themselves for eight days, they again took the\nfield with six thousand combatants, and marched for the county of\nArtois. They came before the town of Bapaume, belonging to the duke of\nBurgundy, and, on their arrival, won the barriers, and advanced to the\ngates, where there was a severe skirmish. But the lord de Heilly, sir\nHugh de Busse, the lord d\u2019Ancuelles and other valiant men at arms, who\nhad been stationed there by the duke of Burgundy, made a sally, and\ndrove them beyond the barriers,--when many gallant deeds were done,\nand several killed and wounded on both sides; but the Burgundians were\nforced to retire within the town, for their enemies were too numerous\nfor them to attempt any effectual resistance. The Orleans-party now\nretreated, and collected much plunder in the adjacent country, which\nthey carried with them to their town of Ham.\n\nDuring this time, sir James de Chastillon[71], and the other\nambassadors from the king of France, negotiated a truce at Leulinghen,\nin the Boulonois, with the english ambassadors, to last for one year on\nsea and land.\n\nWhile these things were passing, the duke of Berry came with the queen\nof France from Melun to Corbeil, and thence sent Louis of Bavaria to\nthe duke of Acquitaine in Paris, and to those who governed the king,\nand also to the butchers, to request that they would be pleased to\nallow him to attend the queen to Paris, and to reside in his h\u00f4tel of\nNeele, near to the king his nephew, since he was determined no way to\ninterfere in the war between the dukes of Orleans and Burgundy.\n\nBut his request was refused, chiefly owing to the butchers of Paris,\nand others of the commonalty, who had great weight; and that he might\ngive over all thoughts of coming, they broke every door and window of\nhis h\u00f4tel de Neele, and committed other great damages. They sent back\nthe queen\u2019s brother with a message to her, to come and reside with her\nlord at Paris, without delay, but not to bring the duke of Berry with\nher.\n\nThe Parisians, fearful that the king and the duke of Acquitaine might\nbe carried off from the h\u00f4tel of St Pol, made them reside at the\nLouvre, where they kept constant guard day and night, to prevent any\nattempts of the Orleans-party to carry them away.\n\nThe queen, on receiving the message by her brother from the Parisians,\nand suspecting the consequences of their commotions, set out from\nCorbeil, and returned to Melun with him and the duke of Berry. A few\ndays after, the Parisians took up arms, marched in a large body to\nCorbeil, took the town, and placed a garrison therein. They then broke\ndown all the bridges over the Seine, between Charenton and Melun, that\nthe Armagnacs might not pass the river and enter the island of France.\n\nWhile the queen and the duke of Berry were at Melun, with the count\nWaleran de St Pol, whom the marshal Boucicaut had sent thither, the\nmaster of the cross-bows and the grand master of the household came to\nthem with few attendants. The duke of Bourbon and the count d\u2019Alen\u00e7on,\non their road from the Vermandois and Beauvoisis, to join the duke of\nOrleans, who was assembling his troops in the G\u00e2tinois, called on the\nqueen and the duke of Berry, to require their aid and support against\nthe duke of Burgundy, which was not granted,--because the king in\nfull council, presided by the duke of Acquitaine, had just published\nan edict in very strong terms, and had caused it to be sent to all the\nbailiwicks and seneschalships of the kingdom, ordering all nobles, and\nothers that were accustomed to bear arms, to make themselves ready to\nserve the king, in company with John duke of Burgundy, and to aid him\nin driving out of his realm all traitorous and disobedient subjects,\ncommanding them to obey the duke of Burgundy the same as himself,\nand ordering all towns and passes to be opened to him, and to supply\nhim with every necessary provision and store, the same as if he were\nthere in person. On this proclamation being issued, very many made\npreparations to serve under the duke of Burgundy with all diligence.\nIn addition, the duke of Acquitaine wrote the duke letters in his own\nhand, by which he ordered all the men at arms dependant on the crown to\nserve personally against his cousin-german, the duke of Orleans, and\nhis allies, who, as he said, were wasting the kingdom in many different\nparts, desiring him to advance as speedily as he could toward Senlis\nand the island of France.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XXXIV.\n\n    THE DUKE OF BURGUNDY ASSEMBLES A LARGE ARMY TO LAY SIEGE TO THE\n    TOWN OF HAM, AND LEADS THITHER HIS FLEMINGS.\n\n\nThe duke of Burgundy, being now assured that the duke of Orleans and\nhis allies were raising a large force to invade his countries, and that\nthey had already placed garrisons in towns and fortresses belonging\nto him or his allies, whence they had made frequent inroads to the\ndespoiling of his country, was highly discontented. To oppose them, he\nhad sent his summons to all his territories in Burgundy, Artois and\nFlanders, and elsewhere, for all nobles, and others accustomed to bear\narms in his behalf, to prepare themselves to join him with all speed,\nwell accoutred and armed, in obedience to the king\u2019s commands, and to\noppose his and the king\u2019s enemies.\n\nHe also solicited the assistance of his good towns in Flanders, and\nrequested that they would powerfully exert themselves in his favour,\nto which they readily and liberally assented. They raised a body of\nforty or fifty thousand combatants, well armed and provided with\nstaves according to the custom of the country. They had twelve thousand\ncarriages, as well carts as cars, to convey their armour, baggage and\nartillery, and a number of very large cross-bows, called ribaudequins,\nplaced on two wheels, each having a horse to draw it. They had also\nmachines for the attack of towns, behind which were long iron spits, to\nbe used toward the close of a battle,--and on each of them was mounted\none or two pieces of artillery.\n\nThe duke of Burgundy had also summoned to his assistance the duke of\nBrabant, his brother, who attended him with a handsome company; as\ndid likewise a valiant english knight, named sir William Baldock,\nlieutenant of Calais, with about three hundred english combatants.\n\nTheir places of rendezvous were at the towns of Douay and Arras, and\nthe adjacent country. The duke of Burgundy, on quitting Douay with his\nbrother of Brabant and great multitudes of men of rank, advanced to\nSluys, belonging to the count de la Marche, where he lodged. On the\nmorrow, the first day of September, he marched away early, and fixed\nhis quarters on the plain near to Marcouin, where he had his tents\nand pavilions pitched, and waited there two days for the arrival of\nhis whole army, and particularly for his Flemings, who came in grand\nparade, and drew up to their quarters in handsome array.--So numerous\nwere their tents that their encampments looked like large towns; and\nin truth, when all were assembled, they amounted to sixty thousand\nfighting men, without including the varlets, and such like, who were\nnumberless,--and the whole country resounded with the noises they made.\n\nWith regard to the Flemings, they thought that no towns or fortresses\ncould withstand them; and the duke of Burgundy was obliged, on their\nsetting off, to abandon to them whatever they might conquer; and when\nthey went from one quarter to another, they were commonly all fully\narmed, and in companies, according to the different towns and the\ncustom of Flanders,--and even when they marched on foot, the greater\npart wore leg-armour.\n\nAs to their mode of marching through a country, whatever they could\nlay hands on was seized, and, if portable, thrown into their carts;\nand they were so proud, on account of their great numbers, that they\npaid not any attention to noble men, however high their rank; and when\nthe army was to be quartered, or when they were on a foraging party,\nthey rudely drove away other men at arms, especially if they were not\ntheir countrymen, taking from them whatever provision they might have\ncollected, or any thing else that pleased them. This conduct created\ngreat disturbances and quarrels, more especially among the Picards, who\nwould not patiently endure their rudeness, insomuch that the duke of\nBurgundy and his captains had great difficulty in keeping any kind of\npeace between them.\n\nThe duke, after waiting some days for the whole of his army, saw it\narrive; and then he marched off triumphantly, and in handsome array,\nand fixed his quarters on the river Scheldt, near to the town of\nMarcouin.\n\nOn the morrow, he advanced to Mouchi la Garhe, between Peronne and Ham,\nand halted there. At this place, a Fleming was hanged for stealing a\nchalice and other valuables from a church. He thence marched toward the\ntown of Ham sur Somme, where his enemies were.\n\nOn his approach to the town of Athies, belonging to the count de\nDammartin, one of his adversaries, the inhabitants were so terrified\nthat they came out in a body to present him with the keys of the gates,\non the condition of being secured from pillage. The duke liberally\ngranted their request, seeing they had thus humbled themselves before\nhim of their own free will, and gave them a sufficient force to guard\ntheir town from being any way molested.----The duke then advanced with\nhis army near to Ham, but sent forward some of his best light troops\nto observe the countenance of the enemy. The Orleans-party sallied\nout against them, and a sharp skirmish took place; but they were\ncompelled, by the superior number of the Burgundians, to retire within\nthe town. The next day he marched his whole army before the place in\nbattle-array, and had his tents pitched on an eminence in front of one\nof the gates, and about the distance of a cannon shot. The Flemings\nwere likewise encamped according to the orders of their marshals\nand leaders, during which the garrison made some sallies, but were\nrepulsed, in spite of their valour, by superior numbers, and many were\nkilled and wounded on each side.\n\nWhen the duke had surrounded this town on one side only, he ordered\nbattering machines to be placed against the gate and wall, to demolish\nthem; and the Flemings pointed their ribaudequins, and shot from them\nso continually, day and night, that the enemy were greatly annoyed.\nBreaches were made in the wall and gate within a few days; but though\nthe garrison was much harrassed, they repaired both in the best manner\nthey could, with wood and dung.\n\nAt length, the besiegers fixed on a day for a general attack on the\ngate, intending to force an entry: the engagement continued very sharp\nfor three hours, but the garrison defended themselves so valiantly,\nwounding and slaying so many of the assailants, that they were forced\nto retreat. This happened on a Thursday; and on the Friday, the duke\nof Burgundy, I know not for what reason, had it proclaimed that no\none should, on any account, make an assault on the town, but that all\nshould labour in forming bridges over the Somme, that a passage might\nbe obtained for the army, and that the place might be besieged on all\nsides,--but events turned out very far from his expectations.\n\nOn the Friday morning, the besieged were expecting that the attack\nwould be renewed; but hearing of the duke\u2019s intentions to cross the\nriver with his army and surround the town, they packed up all their\nvaluables and fled, leaving within the walls only poor people and\npeasants, who had retired thither for safety. Those persons not having\nability or inclination to defend themselves, the duke\u2019s army, headed\nby the Picards, entered the place without any danger. The Flemings,\nobserving this, rushed so impetuously to gain admittance that many\nwere squeezed to death. When they had entered, they instantly began to\nplunder all they could lay hands on, according to the liberty which\ntheir lord the duke had granted them; for, as I have said, he had been\nnecessitated so to do before they would march from home. Part placed\nthemselves on one side of the street, leading to the gate which they\nhad entered, and part on the other; and when the Picards, or others\nnot of their country, were returning, they stopped and robbed them of\nall they had: they spared no man, noble or otherwise; and in this riot\nseveral were killed and wounded.\n\nThey entered a monastery of the town, and took away all they could\nfind, and carried to their tents many of both sexes, and children;\nand, on the morrow, having seized all they had, they set fire to\nseveral parts of the town,--and, to conclude all, the churches and\nhouses, with many of the inhabitants, were burnt, as well as a great\nquantity of cattle that had been driven thither as to a place of\nsecurity.\n\nNotwithstanding this cruel conduct of the Flemings, six or seven of the\nmonks escaped from the monastery, by the assistance of some noblemen,\nparticularly the prior, who most reverently held in his hands a cross,\nand were conducted to the tents of the duke of Burgundy, where they\nwere in safety.\n\nSuch was the conduct of the Flemings at the commencement of this war.\nThere were many towns beyond the Somme that belonged to the duke of\nOrleans and his allies, who, hearing of what had passed at Ham, were,\nas it may be readily believed, in the utmost fear and alarm; and there\nwere few people desirous of waiting their coming, lest they should be\nbesieged in some fortress, and suffer a similar fate,--for sir Clugnet\nde Brabant and sir Manessier Guieret, as I have said, had already\nabandoned Ham, which was well supplied with stores and provision, and\nhad retreated to Chauni and to Coucy.\n\nThe inhabitants of the town of Neelle, belonging to the count de\nDammartin, seeing the smoke of Ham, were greatly perplexed, for their\ngarrison had fled; but they, following the example of the town of\nAthies, waited on the duke of Burgundy, and, with many lamentations,\npresented him with the keys of their town, offering to submit\nthemselves to his mercy. The duke received them into favour, in the\nname of the king and his own, on their swearing not to admit any\ngarrison, and to be in future true and loyal subjects to the king,\ntheir sovereign lord.\n\nThis oath they willingly took; and, having thanked the duke for his\nmercy, they returned to their town, and by his orders demolished some\nof their gates and many parts of their walls. They also made their\nmagistrates and principal inhabitants swear to the observance of the\ntreaty which they had made, and for this time they remained in peace.\n\nIn like manner, those of the town of Roye, that were but lately become\nsubjects to the king, sent deputies to the duke, at his camp before\nHam, to say, that the Orleans party had treacherously entered their\ntown, and had done them much mischief, but that they had departed on\nhearing of his march, and requesting he would not be displeased with\nthem, as they were ready to receive him, and act according to his\npleasure. The duke told them, he should be satisfied if they would\npromise, on their oaths, never to admit again within their walls any of\nhis adversaries of the Orleans-party. Having obtained this answer, they\nreturned joyous to their town.\n\nThe duke now passed the Somme with his army at Ham, leaving that town\ncompletely ruined, and marched toward Chauni on the Oise, belonging to\nthe duke of Orleans; but the garrison, hearing of it, quitted the place\nin haste. The townsmen, greatly alarmed, sent, without delay, to offer\nhim their keys, and humbly supplicated his mercy, saying that their\nlord\u2019s men at arms had fled on hearing of his approach, from the fear\nthey had of him. The duke received them kindly, and took their oaths,\nthat they would henceforth loyally obey the king their sovereign lord,\nand himself, and would admit a garrison of his men to defend the town.\n\nAfter the conclusion of this treaty, the duke advanced to Roye, in the\nVermandois, and was lodged in the town, having quartered his army\nin the country round it. He dispatched thence sir Peter des Essars,\nknight, and his confidential adviser, to the king of France, to his\nson-in-law the duke of Acquitaine, and to the citizens of Paris, to\nmake them acquainted with the strength of his army, and with his\nsuccesses. Sir Peter des Essars was honourably received by the duke\nof Acquitaine and the Parisians; and in compliment to the duke of\nBurgundy, he was reinstated in his office of provost, in the room of\nsir Brunelet de Sainct Cler, who, by the royal authority, was appointed\nbailiff of Senlis, on the dismission of sir Gastelius du Bost, who was\nsuspected of being a favourer of the Orleans-party.\n\nWhen sir Peter des Essars had finished the business he had been sent\non to Paris, he set out for Rethel to announce to the count de Nevers,\nwho had assembled a considerable force, the march of the duke, and to\ndesire him to advance to the town of Mondidier, where he would have\nmore certain intelligence of his brother. The count de Nevers, on\nhearing this, used all diligence to assemble his men, and set off to\njoin the duke.\n\nDuring these transactions, the duke of Orleans, the count d\u2019Armagnac,\nthe constable of France, the master of the cross-bows, with a large\nbody of men at arms and others, came to the town of Melun, where the\nqueen of France and the duke of Berry resided. Having held a conference\nwith the queen and duke, they advanced to La Fert\u00e8 on the Marne, which\nbelonged to sir Robert de Bar[72], in right of his wife the viscountess\nde Meaux. They crossed the Marne, and came to Arsy en Mussien, in the\ncounty of Valois, dependant on the duke of Orleans, where his brother,\nthe count de Vertus, met him.\n\nThe count was accompanied by a numerous body of combatants, among whom\nwere the duke of Bourbon, John son to the duke of Bar, sir William de\nCoucy, Am\u00e9 de Sallebruche, sir Hugh de Hufalize, with others from the\nArdennes, Lorraine and Germany, who, in the whole, amounted to full six\nthousand knights and esquires, not including armed infantry and bowmen;\nand this party was henceforward popularly called _Armagnacs_, as I have\nbefore observed. Each bore on his armour badges similar to those which\nthey had formerly worn when they lay before Paris.\n\nThe duke of Orleans marched this army from the Valois, passing by\nSenlis, toward his county of Beaumont; but Enguerrand de Bournouville,\nwho had been posted in Senlis with a large force of men at arms to\nguard it, sallied out on their rear, and made a good booty of their\nbaggage as well as prisoners. In doing this, however, he lost some of\nhis men, who were slain or taken, and he then returned to Senlis. The\nduke of Orleans, with the other princes, were lodged in the castle of\nBeaumont, and his army in the country surrounding it.\n\nThe count de Nevers was prevented from joining his brothers as he\nintended,--for the Armagnacs, being the strongest, constrained him to\nconduct his army to Paris.\n\nThe duke of Burgundy was already arrived at Mondidier with his whole\narmy, and was making preparations to combat his enemies, should they\nbe so inclined, or to attack any town to which they should retire,\naccording to his pleasure. But the Flemings were now desirous to return\nhome, and had demanded permission of the duke, saying, that they had\nserved the time required of them on their departure from Flanders.\n\nThe duke was much surprised and displeased at their conduct, but\nearnestly desired that they would stay with him for only eight days\nlonger, as he had received intelligence that his enemies were near at\nhand, with a great army, ready to offer him battle, and that they could\nnever serve him more effectually. At this moment, the greater part of\ntheir officers waited on the duke to take leave of him, who, hearing\nthe earnest and affectionate manner in which he made so trifling a\nrequest, resolved to go back to their men and inform them of it, and\npromised to do every thing in their power in order that it should be\ncomplied with.\n\nOn their return to the tent of Ghent, where all their councils were\nheld, they assembled the leaders of the commonalty, and told them the\nrequest the duke their lord had made, namely, that they would stay with\nhim only eight days more, for that his adversaries were at hand with\na large army to offer him battle. This request having been stated,\nvarious were the opinions of the meeting: some were for staying, others\nnot, saying they had fulfilled the term required of them by their\nlord,--that winter was approaching, when, so numerous as they were,\nthey could not keep the field without great danger. Their opinions\nwere so discordant that no conclusion could be formed, to enable their\ncaptains to give any positive answer to the duke.\n\nThis council was held the 20th day of September, in the afternoon;\nand when it became dusk, these Flemings made very large fires in\ndifferent places, of the wood and timber of the houses which they\nhad pulled down and destroyed in Mondidier. They then began to load\ntheir baggage-waggons, and to arm themselves; and at midnight they all\nshouted from their quarters, in Flemish, _Vax, vax!_ which signifies,\n\u2018To arms, to arms!\u2019 and alarmed all the other parts of the army.\n\nThe duke of Burgundy was entirely ignorant of what they intended to do,\nand sent some flemish lords to know their intentions; but they would\nnot explain themselves to any one, and made answers contrary to the\nquestions asked. During this, the night passed away; and the moment day\nappeared, they harnessed their horses to the baggage-waggons, and set\nfire to all their lodgings, shouting, \u2018Gau, gau!\u2019 and departed, taking\nthe road to Flanders.\n\nThe attendants of the duke of Burgundy, hearing this cry and clamour,\nwent to inform him of it in his tent. Very much astonished thereat, he\ninstantly mounted his horse, and, accompanied by the duke of Brabant,\nrode after them. When he had overtaken them, with his head uncovered\nand his hands uplifted, he most humbly besought them to return,\nand stay with him four days only, calling them his most trusty and\nwell-beloved friends and companions, offering them great gifts, and\npromising to relieve the country of Flanders from taxes for ever, if\nthey would comply with his wishes.\n\nThe duke of Brabant also remonstrated with them on the advantages\noffered them by their lord, and, as he asked in return so very trifling\na favour, entreated them to pay due deference to his demand. But it was\nin vain: they turned a deaf ear to all that was said, and continued\ntheir march, only showing the written agreements they had made with\nthe duke, which were carried before them, and which they had fulfilled\non their part; but, as they were signed with his seal, he had not\nperformed his, in having them escorted beyond the river Somme to a\nplace of safety. Should he refuse to do this, they would send him his\nonly son, then at Ghent, cut into thousands of pieces.\n\nThe duke of Burgundy, noticing their rude manners, and perceiving that\nnothing was to be gained from them by fair means, began to appease them\nby ordering the trumpets to sound for decamping. This was not done\nwithout much loss,--for the duke, occupied solely with the attempt to\nmake the Flemings change their minds, had not ordered the tents to be\nstruck, nor the baggage loaded, so that the greater part of the tents\nwere burnt, with other things, from the fire of the houses caused\nby the Flemings on their departure. The flames spread from house to\nhouse, to the lodgings of the duke of Burgundy, who was troubled to the\nheart,--for he well knew that his adversaries were in high spirits, a\nshort day\u2019s march off, and he was anxious to give them battle; but from\nthis conduct of the Flemings his intentions would be frustrated,--and\nwhat was worse, he knew for certain, that the moment they should hear\nof it, they would publish that he had retreated, not daring to meet\nthem. He was, nevertheless, forced to submit to events which he could\nnot foresee nor prevent.\n\nThe Flemings had no sooner turned their faces homeward but they\nadvanced more in one day than in three before, and whatever they could\nlay hands on was pillaged and thrown into their baggage-carts: they\nhad, moreover, many quarrels with the Picards and English, and it often\nhappened that stragglers were wounded or put to death,--and when they\nwere superior in numbers, they failed not to retaliate.\n\nIt must be remembered, that this retreat took place in the month of\nSeptember, when the grapes in the vineyards were ripe; and they robbed\nevery vineyard they passed, devouring so many that numbers were found\ndead among the vines. On the other hand, they fed their horses and\ncattle so very abundantly on the immense pillage which they every where\nmade, that very many were bursten.\n\nThe duke of Burgundy, on his arrival at Peronne with his men at arms,\nwent personally to thank the Flemings, who were encamped on the river\nside, in the most humble manner for their services, and then had them\nescorted by his brother, the duke of Brabant, to Flanders, when every\nman returned to his home. The magistrates of the great towns were,\nhowever, very much displeased when they heard of their behaviour; but\nthey did not at the time notice it, for there were too many of them\nunder arms.\n\nThus did the Flemings retreat from Mondidier contrary to the will of\ntheir lord, the duke of Burgundy. On the same day, a knight of the\nparty of the duke of Orleans, called sir Peter de Quesnes, lord of\nGarois, at the head of full two hundred combatants, made an attack\non Mondidier, about four hours after they had marched away. He found\nthere many people, especially merchants, and inhabitants of the\nneighbourhood, whom he took prisoners: he slew many, and he and his men\nmade a very great booty.\n\nHe then returned to Clermont in Beauvoisis, whither the Armagnacs had\nmarched in pursuit of the count de Nevers. When they heard of this\nretreat of the duke of Burgundy and the Flemings, they held a council\nwhether or not they should follow them into their own country. It\nwas at length determined by the wisest to return toward Paris, and\nattempt to gain admittance by means of some connexions they had there,\nprincipally in order to have possession of the person of the king,\nwhich was their grand object.\n\nThey began their march, in consequence, towards Verberies, and crossed\nthe river Oise by a new bridge, which they erected, and thence advanced\nfor Paris. Those who had the guard of the king and the Parisians\nwere not well pleased to hear of their being so near, and made every\npreparation to oppose their entrance to Paris. The Armagnacs, finding\nit impossible to succeed, managed so well with the inhabitants of St\nDenis that they were there admitted; and the princes lodged in the\ntown, and the army in the adjacent fields and villages. From that\nsituation, they made a sharp war on the town of Paris, and on all those\nwho sided with the king and the duke of Burgundy.\n\nThey advanced daily from different parts to the very gates of\nParis,--when sallies were made against them, particularly by sir\nEnguerrand de Bournouville, who was one of the chiefs of the garrison\nunder the count Waleran de St Pol, the governor of the town. Severe\nskirmishes often took place, and many gallant deeds were done by the\nmen at arms of both sides.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XXXV.\n\n    THE DUKE OF BURGUNDY ASSEMBLES ANOTHER ARMY TO MARCH TO\n    PARIS.--EVENTS THAT HAPPENED DURING THAT TIME.\n\n\nWe will now return to the duke of Burgundy, who having, as I have said,\ndismissed his Flemings, under the escort of his brother the duke of\nBrabant, went from Peronne to Arras, where he met the earls of Pembroke\nand of Arundel, and sir William Baldock, who had accompanied him on his\nlate expedition. As these earls were lately come from England, he paid\nthem every respect, in compliment to the king of England who had sent\nthem. They had brought full twelve hundred combatants, as well horse as\nfoot, all men of courage.\n\nMuch intercourse took place at this time between the king of England\nand the duke of Burgundy, respecting a marriage between Henry prince of\nWales and one of the duke\u2019s daughters[73].--After he had magnificently\nfeasted these english captains in his town of Arras, and made them\nhandsome presents, he ordered them to march to Peronne, and hastily\nsummoned men at arms from all quarters to meet him personally at\nPeronne, where he had commanded the nobles of his estates to assemble.\n\nThe duke of Brabant did not meet him this time, being detained in the\ncounty of Luxembourg by affairs on behalf of his wife. The duke of\nBurgundy left Peronne with no more than six thousand combatants, and\nmarched to Roye,--thence, by Breteuil, to Beauvais, and from Beauvais,\nthrough Gisors, to Pontoise, where he halted for three weeks or\nthereabout. During this period, great numbers of men at arms came from\ndifferent countries to serve him.\n\nWhile these things were passing, it was ordered by the royal council,\nin the presence of the duke of Acquitaine, the count de Mortain,\nthe lord Gilles of Brittany, Waleran count de St Pol, governor of\nParis, the chancellor of France[74], the lord Charles de Savoisy,\nand other great nobles, that certain proclamations should be sent to\nall the bailiwicks and seneschalships of the kingdom, respecting the\nassembling of such large bodies of men at arms, daily done in defiance\nof the king\u2019s orders, by the duke of Orleans, his brothers, the duke\nof Bourbon, the counts d\u2019Alen\u00e7on and d\u2019Armagnac, and others of their\nparty, to the great mischief and tribulation of the kingdom at large,\nand highly displeasing to the king and disgraceful to his dignity.\n\nThis proclamation again prohibited any one from daring to join the\naforesaid nobles, or any of their party in arms, under pain of being\nreputed rebels and traitors to the king and his realm. It likewise\ncommanded all that had joined them to depart without delay, and return\npeaceably to their homes, without further living on or harrassing the\npeople, and ordered that no hindrance should be given to prevent this\nfrom being carried into effect. Such as should disobey these orders\nwould be most rigorously prosecuted without delay as rebels,--and from\nthat day forth no grace or favour would be shown them.\n\nThis proclamation was published in the usual places, and some few, but\nin no great number, privately quitted the party of the Armagnacs, and\nreturned to that of the king. Those that were disobedient, when taken\nby the royal officers, were in great danger of their lives. Several\nwere publicly executed; and among them a knight, called sir Binet\nd\u2019Espineuse, attached to the duke of Bourbon from being a native of\nthe county of Clermont, suffered at Paris. The cause of his death was\nhis having taken by force some flanders horses that were coming as a\npresent to the duke of Acquitaine from the duke of Burgundy. After he\nwas beheaded in the market-place, his body was suspended by the arms to\nthe gibbet at Montfaucon.\n\nThis punishment was inflicted by order of sir Peter des Essars, who, as\nhas been said, was lately re-established in his office of provost of\nParis, in the room of sir Brunelet de Sainct-Cler.\n\nThe duke of Orleans and his party were indignant at this execution, as\nwell as at the late royal proclamation; and the duke of Bourbon was\nparticularly angry at the disgraceful death of his knight.\n\nThus affairs went on from bad to worse. One day, the duke of Orleans\nfixed his quarters, with a large force, at the castle of St Ouen, which\nis a royal mansion, and thence made daily excursions to the gates of\nParis. He pressed the Parisians so hard that they were much straitened\nfor provisions; for they were not as yet accustomed to war, nor had\nthey provided any stores or assembled a force sufficient to repel the\nattacks of their adversaries.\n\nThe archbishop of Sens, brother to the late grand master Montagu, had\njoined the Armagnacs, but not in his pontifical robes; for instead\nof a mitre, he wore a helmet,--for a surplice, a coat of mail,--and\nfor a cope, a piece of steel,--for his croisier, a battle-axe. At this\nperiod, the duke of Orleans sent his heralds with letters to the king\nand the duke of Acquitaine, to inform them that the duke of Burgundy\nhad fled with his Flemings from Mondidier, not daring to wait his\nnearer approach. He took that opportunity of writing also to some\nof his friends in Paris, to know if through their means he could be\nadmitted into the town. It was lost labour, for those who governed for\nthe duke of Burgundy were too active and attentive in keeping the party\ntogether.\n\nBy some intrigues between those of the Orleans-party and one named\nColinet du Puiseur, who was governor for the king in the town of St\nCloud, this place was given up to them. The duke of Orleans instantly\nre-garrisoned it, and continually harrassed the Parisians; for now\nhe could at any time cross the Seine at the bridge of St Cloud, and\nattack both sides of Paris at once. Thus were the Parisians oppressed\non all sides by the Armagnacs,--on which account, another proclamation\nwas issued in the king\u2019s name throughout the realm, complaining of\nthe continued atrocious and rebellious acts, in spite of the positive\norders of the king to the contrary, committed by the duke of Orleans\nand his allies, to the great loss and destruction of his subjects\nand kingdom; that since such grievous complaints had been made on\nthe subject, and were continually made, he was resolved to have a\nstop put to such lawless proceedings. The king, therefore, with\nmature deliberation of council, now declares the aforesaid family of\nOrleans, and their allies, rebels, and traitors to himself and the\ncrown of France; and in order that henceforward no persons may dare\nto join them, he declares, all such to have forfeited their lives and\nestates, and by these presents gives power and authority to all his\nloyal subjects to arrest and imprison any of the aforesaid rebels, and\nto seize on their properties, moveable or immoveable, and to drive\nthem out of the kingdom, without let or hindrance from any of the\nking\u2019s officers. Given at Paris, the 3d day of October, 1411. Signed\nby the king, on the report from the great council specially called\nfor this purpose, at the h\u00f4tel de St Pol, when were present the duke\nof Acquitaine, the count de Mortain, the count de la Marche, Louis\nde Baviere, the lord Gilles of Brittany, the count de St Pol, the\nchancellor of France, with many other nobles of high rank.\n\nIn consequence of this proclamation, many of the captains and noblemen\nof the Armagnacs grew cold in their service, or delayed joining them\naccording to their former agreements; and fearing greater evils might\nbefal them by further incurring the indignation of the king, they\nwithdrew to the king\u2019s party, and excused themselves the best way they\ncould.\n\nWhile these affairs were going forward, the duke of Burgundy remained\nat Pontoise, as I have before said, and was there joined by numbers of\nmen at arms, as well vassals to the king as his own.\n\nDuring his stay at Pontoise, a man of a strong make entered his\napartment, with the intention to murder him, and had a knife hid in\nhis sleeve to accomplish his wicked purpose; but as he advanced to\nspeak with him, the duke, having no knowledge of his person, and always\nsuspicious of such attempts, placed a bench before him. Shortly after,\nsome of his attendants, perceiving his design, instantly arrested him,\nwhen, on confessing his intentions, he was beheaded in the town of\nPontoise.\n\nThe king, in order to strike more terror into the duke of Orleans\nand his allies, issued other proclamations throughout his kingdom.\nUnderneath is the tenour of the one which he sent to the bailiff of\nAmiens.\n\n\u2018Charles, by the grace of God, king of France, to the bailiff of\nAmiens, or to his lieutenant, sends health.\n\n\u2018It has lately come to our knowledge, by informations laid before\nour council, that John, our uncle of Berry, Charles our nephew, duke\nof Orleans, and his brothers, with John de Bourbon, John d\u2019Alen\u00e7on,\nCharles d\u2019Albreth, our cousin Bernard d\u2019Armagnac, in conjunction with\nothers, their aiders and abettors, moved by the wicked and damnable\ninstigations of their own minds, have for a long time plotted to depose\nand deprive us of our royal authority, and with their utmost power to\ndestroy our whole family, which God forbid! and to place another king\non the throne of France, which is most abominable to the hearing of\nevery heart in the breasts of our loyal subjects.\n\n\u2018We, therefore, by the mature deliberation of our council, do most\nsolemnly, in this public manner, divulge these abominable and\ntraitorous intentions of the aforesaid persons, and earnestly do call\nfor the assistance of all our loyal subjects, as well those bound to\nserve us by the tenure of their fiefs as the inhabitants of all our\ntowns, who have been accustomed to bear arms, to guard and defend our\nrights and lives against the traitors aforesaid, who have now too\nnearly approached our person, inasmuch as they have entered by force\nour town of St Denis, which contains not only many holy relics of the\nsaints but the sacred bodies of saints, our crown and royal standard,\nknown by the name of the Oriflamme, with several other precious and\nrare jewels.\n\n\u2018They have also gained forcible possession of the bridge of St Cloud,\nand have invaded our rights, (not to say any thing of our very dear\nand well-beloved cousin, the duke of Burgundy, to whom they have sent\nletters of defiance,) by setting fire to and despoiling our towns and\nvillages, robbing churches, ransoming or killing our people, forcing\nmarried women, and ravishing maidens, and committing every mischief\nwhich the bitterest enemy could do. We therefore do enjoin and command\nthee, under pain of incurring our heaviest displeasure, that thou\ninstantly cause this present ordinance to be proclaimed in the usual\nplaces in the town of Amiens, and in different parts within thy said\nbailiwick, so that no one may plead ignorance; and that thou do punish\ncorporally, and by confiscation of property, the aforesaid persons,\ntheir allies and confederates, whom thou mayest lay hands on, as guilty\nof the highest treason against our person and crown, that by so doing\nan example may be held forth to all others. We also command, under\nthe penalty aforesaid, all our vassals, and all those in general who\nare accustomed to carry arms, to repair to us as soon as possible. Be\ncareful to have the within ordinances strictly executed, so that we may\nnot have cause to be displeased with thee.\n\n\u2018Given at Paris, the 14th day of October, 1411, and in the 32d year of\nour reign.\u2019\n\nThis ordinance was signed by the king, on the report of his council,\nand thus dispatched to Amiens and other good towns, where it was\nproclaimed in the usual places, and with such effect on the vassals and\nloyal subjects of the king that they hastened in prodigious numbers to\nserve him.\n\nOn the other hand, very many of those who were of the Orleans-party\nwere arrested in divers parts of the realm,--some of whom were\nexecuted, and others confined in prison, or ransomed, as if they had\nbeen public enemies. It was pitiful to hear the many and grievous\ncomplaints which were made by the people of their sufferings, more\nespecially by those in the neighbourhood of Paris and in the isle of\nFrance.\n\nI must not forget, among other circumstances, to relate, that the\nParisians, to the amount of three thousand, as well those of the\ngarrison as others, sallied out of Paris, and went to the palace of\nWinchester (Bic\u00eatre), a very handsome mansion of the duke of Berry,\nwhere, from hatred to the duke, they destroyed and plundered the whole,\nleaving the walls only standing.--When they had done this, they went\nand destroyed another house, where the duke kept his horses, situated\non the river Seine, not far from the h\u00f4tel de Neelle.\n\nThe duke was much enraged when he was told of the insult and mischief\nthat had been done to him, and said aloud, that a time would come when\nthese Parisians should pay dearly for it.\n\nAffairs daily grew worse; and at length, the duke of Berry, the duke of\nOrleans and his brothers, the duke of Bourbon, the counts d\u2019Alen\u00e7on and\nd\u2019Armagnac, the lord d\u2019Albreth, were personally banished the realm by\nthe king, with all their adherents, of whatever rank they might be, by\nsound of trumpet in all the squares of Paris, and forbidden to remain\nor set foot within it until they should be recalled.\n\nThey were not only banished the kingdom of France, but, by virtue of\na bull of pope Urban V. of happy memory, (preserved in the Tr\u00e9sor des\nChartres of the king\u2019s privileges in the holy chapel at Paris), they\nwere publicly excommunicated and anathematised in all the churches of\nthe city of Paris, by bell, book, and candle. Many of their party were\nmuch troubled at these sentences, but, nevertheless, continued the same\nconduct, and made a more bitter war than before.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XXXVI.\n\n    THE DUKE OF BURGUNDY MARCHES A LARGE ARMY FROM PONTOISE TO\n    PARIS, THROUGH MELUN.--THE SITUATION AND CONDUCT OF THE DUKE OF\n    ORLEANS.\n\n\nI have mentioned, that during the stay of the duke of Burgundy at\nPontoise, he received great reinforcements of men at arms from all\nparts: among others, the count de Penthievre, his son-in-law, joined\nhim with a noble company. Having remained there for about fifteen days,\nand made diligent inquiry into the state of his adversaries, on the 22d\nday of October, he marched his whole army thence about two o\u2019clock in\nthe afternoon. As the royal road from that place to Paris was occupied\nby the enemy, he quitted it for that through Melun sur Seine, where\nhe crossed the river with full fifteen thousand horse, and, marching\nall night, arrived on the morrow morning at the gate of St Jacques at\nParis. Great multitudes went out of the town to meet him; among whom\nwere the butchers of Paris, well armed and arrayed, conducted by the\nprovosts of the Ch\u00e2telet and of the merchants, under the command of the\ncount de Nevers, brother to the duke of Burgundy, who was attended by\nseveral princes, noble lords and captains: even the great council of\nstate went out upwards of a league to meet him, and to do him honour.\nIndeed, they all showed him as much deference and respect as they could\nhave done to the king of France, on his return from a long journey.\n\nWith regard to the people of Paris, they made great rejoicings on his\narrival, and sang carols in all the streets through which he passed;\nand because his entry was made late in the day, and it was dusk, the\nstreets were illuminated with great quantities of torches, bonfires and\nlanthorns.\n\nOn his approach to the Louvre, the duke of Acquitaine, who had married\nhis daughter, advanced to meet him, and received him with joy and\nrespect. He led him into the Louvre, and presented him to the king and\nqueen, who received him most graciously.\n\nHaving paid his due respects, he withdrew, and went to lodge at\nthe h\u00f4tel de Bourbon. The earl of Arundel was quartered, with his\nattendants, at the priory of St Martin des Champs, and his Englishmen\nnear to him in the adjoining houses. The rest quartered themselves as\nwell as they could in the city.\n\nOn the morrow, which was a Sunday, Enguerrand de Bournouville, with\nmany valiant men at arms and archers, as well Picards as English, made\na sally as far as La Chapelle, which the Armagnacs had fortified, and\nquartered themselves within it. On seeing their adversaries advancing,\nthey mounted their horses, and a sharp skirmish ensued, in which\nmany were unhorsed. Among those who behaved well, sir Enguerrand was\npre-eminent. Near his side was John of Luxembourg, nephew to the count\nde St Pol, but very young. Many were wounded, but few killed. The\nEnglish, with their bows and arrows, were very active in this affair.\n\nWhile this action was fought, the Armagnacs quartered at St Denis,\nMontmartre, and other villages, hearing the bustle, mounted their\nhorses, and hastened to cut off the retreat of Enguerrand. He was\ninformed of this in time, and, collecting his men, retreated toward\nParis; but as the enemy were superior in numbers, they pressed hard on\nhis rear, and killed and made prisoners several of his men.\n\nThe duke of Orleans and the princes of his party, on hearing of the\narrival of the duke of Burgundy with so large an army in Paris, ordered\ntheir men at arms, and others that were lodged in the villages round,\nto unite and quarter themselves at St Denis. To provide forage, sir\nClugnet de Brabant was sent with a body of men at arms into the Valois\nand Soissonois, where there was abundance. Sir Clugnet acquitted\nhimself well of his command, and brought a sufficient quantity to\nSt Denis; for at this time there was great plenty of corn and other\nprovision in France.\n\nThe Armagnacs were, therefore, well supplied; and as they were the\nstrongest on that side of Paris, they daily made excursions of\ndifferent parties as far as the rivers Marne and Oise, and throughout\nthe isle of France. In like manner, the army of the king and the duke\nof Burgundy scoured the country on the other side of the Seine, as far\nas Montlehery, Meulan and Corbeil; and thus was the noble kingdom of\nFrance torn to pieces.\n\nThere were frequent and severe rencounters between the men at arms of\neach side; and a continued skirmish was going forward between those in\nParis and in St Denis, when the honour of the day was alternately won.\n\nAmong other places where these skirmishes took place was a mill,\nsituated on an eminence, and of some strength. In this mill, two or\nthree hundred of the Orleans-party sometimes posted themselves, when\nthe Parisians and Burgundians made an attack on them, which lasted even\nuntil night forced them to retreat.--At other times, the Burgundians\nposted themselves in the mill, to wait for the assault of their\nadversaries.\n\nThe duke of Orleans had with him an english knight, called the lord de\nClifford, who had, some time before, joined him with one hundred men\nat arms and two hundred archers, from the country of the Bourdelois.\nHaving heard that the king of England had sent the earl of Arundel,\nwith several other lords, to the duke of Burgundy, he waited on the\nduke of Orleans to request that he would permit him to depart, for that\nhe was afraid his sovereign would be displeased with him should he\nremain any longer. The duke of Orleans having for a while considered\nhis request granted it, but on condition that neither he himself nor\nhis men should bear arms against him during the war. The knight made\nhim this promise, and then returned to England.\n\nOn the 6th day of November, Troullart de Moncaurel, governor and\nbailiff of Senlis, having marched about six score combatants of his\ngarrison to the country of Valois, was met by seven score of the\nArmagnacs, who vigorously attacked him; but, after many gallant deeds\nwere done, Troullart remained victorious. From sixty to eighty of the\nArmagnacs were taken or slain; and among the prisoners was sir William\nde Saveuse, who had followed the Orleans-party, when his two brothers,\nHector and Philip, were in arms with the duke of Burgundy. Thus, in\nthis abominable warfare, were brothers engaged against brothers, and\nsons against fathers. After this defeat, Troullart de Moncaurel and\nPeter Quieriet, who had accompanied him, returned with their booty\nto Senlis, when, shortly after, by the exertions of the old lord de\nSaveuse and the two brothers, Hector and Philip, sir William obtained\nhis liberty.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XXXVII.\n\n    THE DUKE OF BURGUNDY LEADS A GREAT FORCE, WITH THE PARISIANS,\n    TO ST CLOUD, AGAINST THE ARMAGNACS.\n\n\nThe duke of Burgundy having remained some time at Paris with his army,\nand having held many councils with the princes and captains who were\nthere, marched out of the town about midnight, on the 9th of November,\nby the gate of St Jacques. He was magnificently accompanied by men at\narms and Parisians, among whom were the counts de Nevers, de la Marche,\nde Vaudemont, de Penthievre, de St Pol, the earl of Arundel, Boucicaut\nmarshal of France, the lord de Vergy marshal of Burgundy, the lord de\nHeilly, lately appointed marshal of Acquitaine, the lord de St George,\nsir John de Croy, Enguerrand de Bournouville, the lord de Fosseux, sir\nRegnier Pot governor of Dauphiny, the seneschal of Hainault sir John de\nGuistelle, the lord de Brimeu, the earl of Kent, an Englishman, with\nmany other nobles, as well from Burgundy as from Picardy and different\ncountries. They were estimated by good judges at six thousand\ncombatants, all accustomed to war, and four thousand infantry from the\ntown of Paris.\n\nWhen they had passed the suburbs, they advanced in good array, under\nthe direction of trusty guides, to within half a league of Saint Cloud,\nwhere the Armagnacs were quartered. It might be about eight o\u2019clock in\nthe morning when they came thither, and the weather was very cold and\nfrosty. Being thus arrived without the enemy knowing of it, the duke of\nBurgundy sent the marshal of Burgundy, sir Gaultier des Ruppes, sir Guy\nde la Trimouille, and le veau de Bar, with eight hundred men at arms,\nand four hundred archers, across the Seine, toward St Denis, to prevent\nthe enemy from there crossing the river by a new bridge which they had\nerected over it. These lords so well executed the above orders that\nthey broke down part of the bridge, and defended the passage.\n\nThe duke, in the mean time, ascended the hill of St Cloud in order of\nbattle, and at the spot where four roads met posted the seneschal of\nHainault, sir John de Guistelle, the lord de Brimeu, John Phillips and\nJohn Potter[75], english captains, at one of them, with about four\nhundred knights and esquires, and as many archers. At another road, he\nstationed the lords de Heilly and de Ront, Enguerrand de Bournouville,\nand Aym\u00e9 de Vitry, with as many men as the knights above-mentioned. The\nthird road was guarded by Neville earl of Kent[76], with some picard\ncaptains; and the Parisians and others, to a great amount, were ordered\nto Sevres, to defend that road.\n\nWhen these four divisions had arrived at their posts, they made\ntogether a general assault on the town of St Cloud, which the Armagnacs\nhad fortified with ditches and barriers to the utmost of their power.\nAt these barriers, a notable defence was made by those who had heard of\nthe arrival of the enemy, under the command of their captains, namely,\nsir James de Plachiel, governor of Angoul\u00eame, the lord de Cambour,\nWilliam Batillier, sir Mansart du Bos, the bastard Jacob, knight, and\nthree other knights from Gascony, who fought bravely for some time; but\nthe superiority of numbers, who attacked them vigorously on all sides,\nforced them to retreat from their outworks, when they were pursued,\nfighting, however, as they retreated, to the tower of the bridge and\nthe church, which had been fortified.\n\nThe whole of the burgundian force which had been ordered on this duty,\nexcepting the party who guarded the passage of the bridge, now bent all\ntheir efforts against the church. The attack was there renewed with\ngreater vigour than before, and, notwithstanding the gallant defence\nthat was made, the church was stormed, and many were slain in the\nchurch as well as at the barriers. Numbers also were drowned of the\ncrowd that was pressing to re-enter the tower of the bridge, by the\ndrawbridge breaking under their weight.\n\nIt was judged by those well acquainted with the loss of the Armagnacs,\nthat including the drowned, there were nine hundred killed and five\nhundred prisoners. Among these last were sir Mansart du Bos, the lord\nde Cambour, and William Batillier. In the town of St Cloud were found\nfrom twelve to sixteen hundred horses that had been gained by plunder,\nand a variety of other things.\n\nWhile this was passing, the duke of Burgundy was with the main army\ndrawn up in battle-array, on a plain above the town: he had with him\nthe greater part of the princes, and his spies were every where on the\nlook-out that the enemy might not surprise him by any unexpected attack.\n\nThe engagement at the tower of the bridge was still continued by the\nBurgundians, in the hope of taking it; but it was labour in vain, for\nthose within defended it manfully.\n\nSome of the garrison sallied out on the opposite side, and hastened\nto St Denis, to inform the duke of Orleans of the disaster that had\nbefallen them. He was sorely displeased thereat, and instantly mounted\nhis horse, accompanied by the duke of Bourbon, the counts d\u2019Alen\u00e7on\nand d\u2019Armagnac, the constable, the master of the cross-bows, the young\nBoucicaut, and about two thousand combatants, advanced toward St Cloud,\nand drew up in battle-array on the side of the river Seine, opposite to\nwhere the duke of Burgundy was posted, and made every preparation as\nif for an immediate combat. The duke of Burgundy and his men likewise\ndismounted, drew up in order of battle, and displayed his banner, which\nwas most rich and splendid. But notwithstanding the eager desire which\nthese princes showed for the combat, it was to no purpose,--for the\nriver was between them, so that no damage could accrue to either party,\nexcepting by some chance bolts from the cross-bows, who shot at random.\n\nWhen the Armagnacs had remained there for some time, seeing that\nnothing effectual could be done, they remounted their horses and\nreturned to St Denis, leaving, however, a reinforcement to defend the\ntower of St Cloud. On their departure, the duke of Burgundy held a\ncouncil, and it was determined to march the whole army back to Paris.\nThe duke lost this day, in slain, not more than from sixteen to twenty;\nbut there were many wounded, among whom were Enguerrand de Bournouville\nand Aym\u00e9 de Vitry, who had fought well, as did the lord of Heilly. In\nlike manner, the earl of Arundel and his men behaved gallantly; and it\nwas one of them who had made sir Mansart du Bos prisoner, but for a sum\nof money he resigned him to one of the king\u2019s officers.\n\nThe duke of Burgundy, on his return, was received by the Parisians with\ngreat acclamations; for they had heard of his brilliant success, and\nthey imagined that through his means they should shortly be delivered\nfrom their enemies, who oppressed them sorely. With regard to the king,\nthe duke of Acquitaine, and the members of the grand council, prelates\nas well as seculars, the reception which they gave him, the princes and\nthe captains of his army, is not to be described.\n\nThe duke of Orleans, learning that the duke of Burgundy had returned\nto Paris with his army, held a council with the heads of his party,\nwhen, having considered the severe loss they had suffered of the most\nexpert of their captains, and the great power and numbers of their\nopponents, whom they could not at this moment withstand with hopes of\nsuccess, they resolved to retire to their own countries, and collect a\nsufficient army to oppose any force the king and the duke of Burgundy\nshould bring against them. This was no sooner determined than executed;\nfor they instantly packed up their baggage, and, crossing the\nnewly-erected bridge over the Seine, which they had repaired, and the\nbridge of St Cloud, hastily marched all night toward Estampes, and then\ncontinued their route to Orleans, and to other towns and castles under\ntheir obedience.\n\nThus, therefore, the duke of Orleans, in seeking vengeance for the\ndeath of his father, gained only disgrace and great loss of men. Such\nof them as were slain in the field, at the battle of St Cloud, were\nthere inhumanly left without sepulture, as being excommunicated, a prey\nto dogs, birds, and wild beasts. Some lords of his party, such as sir\nClugnet de Brabant, sir Aym\u00e9 de Sarrebruche, the lord de Hufalize, and\nmany more, passed through the county of Valois to Champagne, and thence\nto their own homes.\n\nNews of this retreat was, very early on the morrow, carried to the\nduke of Burgundy and his captains at Paris. Some of them mounted their\nhorses, and went to St Denis, when all that the Armagnacs had left was\nseized on and pillaged: they even arrested and carried away, in the\nking\u2019s name, the abbot of St Denis, for having admitted his enemies\ninto that town. Many of the principal inhabitants were also fined,\nnotwithstanding the excuses they offered. Others of the duke\u2019s officers\nwent to the town of St Cloud, which they found abandoned.--Many pursued\nthe Armagnacs, but in vain; for they had marched all night, and were at\na considerable distance before the news of their decampment had reached\nParis.\n\nA few days after, the king, by the advice and entreaties of the duke\nof Burgundy, bought the greater part of the prisoners made at the late\nbattle, by paying their ransoms to those who had taken them. In the\nnumber was Colinet, thus surnamed by many, who had betrayed the bridge\nof St Cloud to the duke of Orleans; and on the 12th day of November, he\nand five of his accomplices were beheaded in the market-place at Paris:\nhis body was quartered, and the five others were hung up by the arms on\nthe gibbet at Montfaucon.\n\nOn the 13th of the same month, a sermon was preached in the\nchurch-square, before the porch of N\u00f4tre Dame in Paris, by a Friar\nMinor, in the presence of the duke of Burgundy, many princes, and a\ngreat concourse of people,--in which he said that the bulls given by\npope Urban V. had been of the utmost efficacy against the rebellious\nsubjects of the king, and publicly denounced the duke of Orleans and\nhis party as excommunicated. They were also thus denounced in many\nother succeeding sermons.\n\nThe ensuing day, the king heard mass in N\u00f4tre Dame, and returned to the\nLouvre to dinner, when he most graciously received the earl of Arundel,\nand caused him to be seated at his table next to the duke of Burgundy.\n\nMany councils were held at Paris respecting this war, and on the\nmeasures the king should now adopt. It was at length determined, that\non account of the winter, neither the king nor the princes should\nattempt any thing more until the ensuing summer, but only have some\nable captains with a sufficient force on the frontiers, to harrass\nand pursue the enemy, and keep him in check. In consequence, the lord\nBoucicaut marshal of France, the lord de Heilly marshal of Acquitaine,\nEnguerrand de Bournouville, Aym\u00e9 de Vitry, the lord de Miraumont and\nothers, were ordered on this service with a very considerable force.\nThey marched toward Estampes and Bonneval, and those parts, having with\nthem the lord de Ront.\n\nBonneval, on the first summons from the above captains, surrendered to\nthe king\u2019s obedience, and the greater part of them were lodged in the\ntown, and in an adjoining abbey of some strength. Those of Estampes\nrefused to surrender, for it was garrisoned by the duke of Berry, and\nbegan to make war on the troops of the king and the duke of Burgundy,\nby the instigation of the lord Louis de Bourbon, governor of Dourdan,\nwho resided there.\n\nAt this period, with the consent of the duke of Burgundy, sir John de\nCroy, eldest son to the lord de Croy, still detained prisoner by the\nduke of Orleans, marched from Paris, with eight hundred combatants, for\nthe castle of Monchas, in the county of Eu, in which were the duke of\nBourbon\u2019s children and his lady-duchess, namely, one son about three\nyears old, and a daughter by her first husband nine years old, with\ntheir nurses and other attendants. The son of sir Mansart du Bos, and\nthe lord de Foulleuses, knight, were also there. The castle and the\nwhole of its inhabitants were taken by sir John de Croy; and he carried\nthem, and all he found within it, to the castle of Renty, where he held\nthem prisoners, until his father, the lord de Croy, was released. When\nthis misfortune was told to the duke of Bourbon, he was much afflicted;\nbut the duchess took it so sensibly to heart that very soon after she\ndied of grief[77].\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XXXVIII.\n\n    THE KING OF FRANCE SENDS THE COUNT DE SAINT POL TO THE VALOIS,\n    AND TO COUCY, AND OTHER CAPTAINS TO DIFFERENT PARTS AGAINST THE\n    ARMAGNACS.\n\n\nConformable to the resolutions of the aforesaid council, count Waleran\nde St Pol was sent into the Valois, to reduce the whole of that country\nto the king\u2019s obedience, and then to march to Coucy with a large body\nof men at arms, archers, and cross-bows.\n\nSir Philip de Servolles, bailiff of Vitry en Pertois, was also ordered\ninto the country of Vertus, with a considerable force, to subdue the\nwhole of it. The vidame of Amiens was sent into the county of Clermont.\nFerry d\u2019Hangest, bailiff of Amiens, was ordered, for the above purpose,\ninto the counties of Boulogne, Eu, and Gamaches.\n\nThe inhabitants of Crespy, the principal town of the Valois, no sooner\nlearnt the intentions of the count de St Pol than they surrendered it\nto him, and received him handsomely. He thence advanced to the castle\nof Pierrefons, which was very strong, and well provided with all\nwarlike stores and provision. On coming before it, he held a parley\nwith the lord de Boquiaux the governor, who concluded a treaty with\nhim for its surrender, on condition that the count would pay him, in\nthe king\u2019s name, two thousand golden crowns for his expenses, and that\nthe garrison should carry away all they had with them. The lady of\nGaucourt, who was in the castle, retired to the castle of Coucy, where\nshe was honourably received by sir Robert d\u2019Esne, the governor.\n\nThe count de St Pol marched from Pierrefons to la Fert\u00e9-Milon, a very\nstrong castle, and to Villers-Cotter\u00eats, both belonging to the duke of\nOrleans; when not only these two but all the other places in Valois,\nhearing of the surrender of so strong a castle as Pierrefons without\nmaking any resistance, surrendered, and returned to their obedience to\nthe king. The Count placed good garrisons in each, and then marched\nfor Coucy, in the Soissonois, where, as I have before said, sir\nRobert d\u2019Esne was governor of the castle. He had with him Rigault des\nFontaines, and others attached to the party of the duke of Orleans.\nThe governor of the town of Coucy was sir Enguerrand des Fontaines,\nand within it were many noblemen, who, holding a council, resolved to\nsurrender the place, and to leave it with all their baggage.\n\nThe count quartered himself and his men at arms in the town and\nsuburbs, and then summoned sir Robert d\u2019Esne, in the king\u2019s name, to\nsurrender the castle. This sir Robert refused to do, saying, that the\nduke of Orleans had given him orders, when he appointed him governor,\nnever to surrender it without his consent or knowledge, and these\norders he had sworn to obey; that it was well provided with all kinds\nof stores, and plenty of provision, so that he did not fear its being\ntaken by force; and he hoped, that before he should be induced to\nyield it, means would be found to restore his lord and master to the\ngood graces of the king.----The count, on hearing this answer, ordered\nthe castle to be surrounded, and quartered his men as near to it as\npossible, keeping up at the same time a brisk cannonade. Among other\nexpedients, the count employed a body of miners, to undermine the gate\nof the lower court, called la Porte Maistre Odon, which was as handsome\nan edifice as could be seen for twenty leagues round; and he employed\ncompanies of miners to work at the other large towers, who were so\nsuccessful that, in a short time, the mines were ready to be set fire\nto.\n\nThe governor was again summoned to surrender, but again refused. Upon\nwhich, the count ordered his men under arms, to be prepared for the\nstorm should it be necessary; and when all was ready, fire was set to\nthe combustibles within the mines, so that when the supporters were\nburnt, the whole of the tower and gate fell flat down, but, fortunately\nfor the besieged, the inside wall remained entire, so that the\nbesiegers were not greatly benefited. Several were killed and wounded\non both sides by the fall of the towers: one of them at the corner was\nprevented from falling to the ground by the wall supporting it; and one\nof the men at arms remained on this inclined tower, where he had been\nposted to guard it, and was in great peril of his life, but was saved\nby the exertions of the garrison.\n\nAt length, when the count de St Pol had been before this castle of\nCoucy about three months, a treaty was entered into between him and sir\nRobert, that he would surrender the castle on condition that he and his\ngarrison should depart unmolested whither they pleased, with all they\ncould carry with them, and should receive, for their expenses, twelve\nhundred crowns, or thereabout. When this was concluded, the governor\nmarched off with about fifty combatants, the principal of whom were\nhis son, le Baudrain de Fur, knight, Rigault des Fontaines, before\nmentioned, and Gaucher de Baissu. The lady de Gaucourt departed also\nin their company. Sir Robert and the greater part of his men went and\nfixed their residence at Creve-coeur and in the castle of Cambresis.\n\nThe count de St Pol, on the surrender of the castle, appointed sir\nGerard de Herbannes governor, with a sufficient garrison. There were\nwith him on this expedition his nephew John of Luxembourg, the vidame\nof Amiens, the lord de Houcourt, and many other nobles and esquires\nfrom Picardy, especially such as were his vassals. Having finished\nthis business so successfully, he returned to the king at Paris, who,\nin consideration of his good qualities, and as a remuneration for his\nservices, nominated him constable of France. The sword of office was\ndelivered to him, and he took the usual oaths, in the room of the lord\nd\u2019Albreth, who had been dismissed therefrom, being judged unworthy to\nhold it any longer.\n\nIn like manner, the lord de Rambures was appointed master of the\ncross-bows of France, in the place of the lord de Hangest, who had been\ndismissed by the king. The lord de Longny, a native of Brittany, was\nmade marshal of France, on the resignation, and with the consent, of\nthe lord de Rieux[78], who was superannuated.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XXXIX.\n\n    SIR PHILIP DE SERVOLLES, BAILIFF OF VITRY, LAYS SIEGE TO THE\n    CASTLE OF MOYENNES.----OTHER PLACES ARE BY THE KING\u2019S OFFICERS\n    REDUCED TO HIS OBEDIENCE.\n\n\nIn regard to the county of Vertus, the moment sir Philip de Servolles\ncame before the town of that name, it surrendered to the king,--and in\nlike manner all the other places in that county, excepting the castle\nof Moyennes. In this castle were sir Clugnet de Brabant, his brother\nJohn of Brabant, sir Thomas de Lorsies, and many more, who would not on\nany account submit to the king.\n\nThe bailiff of Vitry consequently laid siege to it, and made every\npreparation to conquer it by force. It was, however, in vain; for the\ngarrison were well provided with provision, artillery and stores of all\nkinds, so that they little feared the besiegers, and very frequently\ncut off their detachments.\n\nThe siege lasted for upwards of three months; and at the end of this\ntime, sir Clugnet and sir Thomas de Lorsies, mounted on strong and\nactive coursers, followed by two pages, set out from the castle,--and,\ngalloping through the besieging army with their lances in their rests,\npassed safely, striking down all opposers, escaped to Luxembourg, and\nwent to sir Aym\u00e9 de Sarrebruche to seek for succour. But they did not\nreturn with any assistance; for a few days after, John of Brabant was\nmade prisoner in a sally from the castle, and, by order of the king and\ncouncil, beheaded in the town of Vitry. After this event, the remainder\nof the garrison surrendered themselves to the king\u2019s obedience, on\nstipulating with the bailiff that they were to have their lives and\nfortunes spared. He instantly new-garrisoned the castle.\n\nThus was that whole country reduced to the king\u2019s obedience; and that\nof Clermont followed the example, by surrendering to the vidame of\nAmiens without making any resistance. The garrisons in the different\ntowns and castles that had done great mischief to the surrounding\ncountry withdrew with all their baggage, under the protection of\npassports, to the Bourbonois, and were replaced by the king\u2019s troops.\n\nThe bailiff of Amiens was equally successful at Boulogne-sur-mer,\nwhich, with all the adjacent places, surrendered, excepting the castle\nof Boulogne,--the seneschal of which, by name sir Louis de Corail,\na native of Auvergne, would not yield it without the permission of\nhis lord, the duke of Berry, who had intrusted it to his guard. The\nbailiff, however, with his men, destroyed the drawbridge, and filled\nup the ditches, so that no one could enter or come out of the castle.\nA parley took place between the governor and bailiff, when the first\nwas allowed to send to his lord, the duke of Berry, to know if he would\nconsent that the castle should be given up to the king, and hold him\ndischarged for so doing.\n\nThe duke, in answer, bade him surrender the castle to the king\u2019s\nofficers, and come to him at Bourges, which was done. In like manner,\nall the places in the county of Eu, and in the territory of Gamaches,\nwere surrendered to the king; and the officers who had been placed in\nthem by their lords were dismissed, and others of the king\u2019s servants\nput in their room.\n\nDuring this time, very large sums of money were raised in Paris and\nelsewhere, to pay the english troops who had come to serve the duke\nof Burgundy by permission of the king of England. On receiving their\npayment, the earl of Arundel, with his men, returned to England by\nway of Calais; but the earl of Kent[79] and his troops remained in the\nservice of the duke of Burgundy.\n\nAt this moment, the Orleans-party were in great distress, and knew not\nwhere to save themselves; for the instant any of them were discovered,\nwhether secular or ecclesiastic, they were arrested and imprisoned, and\nsome executed,--others heavily fined. Two monks were arrested at this\ntime, namely, master Peter Fresnel, bishop of Noyon, who was taken by\nsir Anthony de Craon, and carried from Noyon to the castle of Crotoy;\nthe other, the abbot of Foresmoustier, was made prisoner by the lord\nde Dampierre, admiral of France. They were soon delivered on paying a\nlarge ransom, when each returned to his bishoprick and monastery.\n\nThe lord de Hangest, still calling himself grand master of the french\ncross-bows, being attached to the Orleans-party, had, after the retreat\nfrom St Denis, secretly retired to the castle of Soissons. Having a\ndesire to attempt regaining the king\u2019s favour, he sent a poursuivant\nto demand a safe conduct from Troullart de Moncaurel, bailiff and\ngovernor of Senlis, for him to come and reside in that town. The safe\nconduct was sent to him, and he came to Senlis; but, because there was\nno mention of his return in this permission, Troullart made him and\nfifteen other gentlemen prisoners in the king\u2019s name. Shortly after,\nthey were carried to the Ch\u00e2telet in Paris, to his great displeasure,\nbut he could not prevent it.\n\nThe count de Roussy also had retired, after the retreat from St Denis,\nto his castle of Pont \u00e1 Arsy sur Aine; but it was instantly surrounded\nby the peasants of the Laonnois, who increased to about fifteen\nhundred, and made most terrible assaults on the castle,--and, in spite\nof its deep moat and thick walls, they damaged it very much. These\npeasants called themselves the king\u2019s children. Sir Brun de Barins,\nknight, bailiff of the Vermandois, and the provost of Laon, came to\nassist and to command them,--when the count, perceiving the danger he\nwas in, to avoid falling into the hands of these peasants, surrendered\nhimself and his castle to the bailiff of the Vermandois, on condition\nthat his own life, and the lives of all within it, should be spared.\nThe bailiff accepted the terms, and, having re-garrisoned it with the\nking\u2019s troops, carried the count and his men prisoners to Laon, where\nthey remained a long time; but at length, on paying a heavy ransom,\nthey obtained their liberty.\n\nThe archdeacon of Brie was, in like manner, taken in the tower of\nAndely by these peasants. He was natural son to the king of Armenia.\nSir William de Coussy, who was of the Orleans-party, retired to his\nbrother in Lorraine, who was bishop of Metz.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XL.\n\n    THE DUKES OF ACQUITAINE AND BURGUNDY MARCH TO CONQUER ESTAMPES\n    AND DOURDAN.----THE EXECUTION OF SIR MANSART DU BOS AND OTHER\n    PRISONERS.\n\n\nDuring these tribulations, there were so many grievous complaints made\nto the king and the princes at Paris, of the mischiefs done to the\ncountry by the garrisons of Estampes and Dourdan, that notwithstanding\nit had been determined in council that neither the king nor the duke\nof Acquitaine should take the field until the winter should be passed,\nthis resolution was overruled by circumstances.\n\nOn the 23d day of November, the duke of Acquitaine, accompanied by the\nduke of Burgundy, the counts of Nevers, de la Marche, de Penthievre,\nde Vaudemont, and the marshal de Boucicaut, with others of rank, and a\ngreat multitude of the Parisians on foot, marched out of Paris, with\nthe intent to reduce to the king\u2019s obedience the garrisons of Estampes\nand Dourdan, and some others, who continued the war on the part of the\nduke of Orleans and his adherents.\n\nHe halted at Corbeil to wait for the whole of his forces,--and thence,\nwith an immense quantity of warlike stores and bombards, with other\nartillery, marched his army toward Estampes, wherein was sir Louis\nde Bourdon, who instantly withdrew into the castle. The townsmen\nimmediately returned to their former obedience, and were kindly\nreceived by the duke of Acquitaine, in consideration of his uncle the\nduke of Berry. Sir Louis de Bourdon, however, refused to surrender,\nalthough he was summoned many times, when the castle was besieged on\nall sides. The lord de Ront was at this time prisoner there,--for he\nhad been taken by sir Louis not long before the arrival of the duke of\nAcquitaine.\n\nMany engines were now pointed against the walls, which they damaged in\nseveral places; and in addition, miners were employed to underwork the\ntowers. The siege was carried on with such vigour that the garrison,\nthinking it probable they should be taken by storm, opened a parley,\nand, by means of the lord de Ront, surrendered themselves to the duke\nof Acquitaine. Sir Louis de Bourdon, with some other gentlemen, his\nconfederates, were sent to the Ch\u00e2telet at Paris. Great part of the\nwealth of Bourdon, with a most excellent courser of his, were given to\nthe lord de Ront, to make amends for the losses which he sustained when\nhe was made prisoner.\n\nThe dukes of Acquitaine and Burgundy re-garrisoned this place, and\nthen returned with their army to Paris; for in truth, they could not,\nfrom the severity of the winter, make any further progress. A few days\nafter, by order of the duke of Burgundy, many noble prisoners were\ncarried from Paris to the castle of Lille; among whom were the lord de\nHangest, sir Louis de Bourdon, the lords de Gerennes, des Fontaines,\nsir John d\u2019Amboise and others, who had been arrested for supporting the\nparty of the duke of Orleans. They suffered a long confinement, but\nwere set at liberty on paying a heavy fine.\n\nAt this period, sir Mansart du Bos was beheaded in the market-place\nof Paris, his body hung by the shoulders on the gibbet at Montfaucon,\nand his head affixed to the spike on the top of the market-house.\nThis execution took place at the instance of the duke of Burgundy,\nbecause sir Mansart was his liege man, nevertheless he had sent him his\nchallenge at the same time with the brothers of Orleans, as has been\nbefore noticed. Not all the solicitations of his friends could save\nhim, and he had many of weight with the duke, who endeavoured earnestly\nto obtain his pardon; but it was in vain, for the duke had resolved\nupon his death.\n\nThere were in the prisons of the Ch\u00e2telet, and in other prisons of\nParis, very many of the Orleans-party who perished miserably through\ncold, famine, and neglect. When dead, they were inhumanly dragged\nout of the town, and thrown into the ditches a prey to dogs, birds,\nand wild beasts. The reason of such cruel conduct was their having\nbeen several times denounced from the pulpits, and proclaimed from\nthe squares, as excommunicated persons. It seemed, however, to many\ndiscreet men, as well noble as of the church, that it was a great\nscandal thus to treat those who were Christians and acknowledged the\nlaws of JESUS CHRIST.\n\nThe same rigorous conduct being persevered in, a short time after,\na valiant knight, called sir Peter de Famechon, was beheaded in the\nmarket-place of Paris: he was of the household and family of the duke\nof Bourbon,--and his head was affixed to a lance like the others. The\nduke of Bourbon was much exasperated at his death, especially when he\nwas informed of the disgraceful circumstances that had attended it. At\nthis time, therefore, all who sided with the Armagnacs, and were taken,\nran great risk of their lives; for there were few that dared speak in\ntheir favour, however near their connexions might be.\n\n\nEND OF THE SECOND VOLUME.\n\n\n  AT THE HAFOD PRESS,\n  BY JA.

This last condition, however, was not\ncompletely fulfilled until the reign of Sigismond Augustus in 1569.\n\n  _Baudran._\n\nJagellon took the name of Uladislaus V. on his baptism; but Hedwige,\ndaughter to the king of Poland, reigned two years before she married\nUladislaus.\n\n  _Anderson._\n\n\n[54] Sigismond was king of Hungary in 1387,--roman emperor 1411,--king\nof Bohemia 1419,--died 1437, aged 70. He married for his second wife\nBarbara, daughter to Hermannus II. count of Cilly in Crain.\n\n  _Anderson._\n\n\n[55] Of the half blood. See p. 138.\n\n[56] _I. e._ Bari.\n\n[57] Probably Nicholas d\u2019Este, connected by marriage with the house of\nMalatesta.\n\n[58] Probably Pandulph Malatesta, lord of Rimini, a captain of great\nreputation and adherent of king Ladislaus.\n\n[59] Sir Raoul de Gaucourt, successively promoted to the posts of\nchamberlain, governor of Dauphin\u00e8, and grand master of the household,\nbecame a distinguished actor in the wars with the English, from 1427 to\n1437 particularly.\n\nThere was also a sir Eustace de Gaucourt, lord of Vicy, who was grand\nfalconer in 1406 and 1412.\n\n[60] Count de Hembe. Q.\n\n[61] Charles de Mouroufle. Q.\n\n[62] The author of \u2018An Account of Livonia, with a Relation of the Rise,\nProgress and Decay of the Marian Teutonic Order,\u2019 London, 1701, relates\nthese transactions in the manner following:\n\n\u2018The order was now on the highest pinnacle of prosperity and honour,\nexceeding great kings and potentates of Europe in extent of dominions,\npower and riches, when Ulricus \u00e0 Jungingen was chosen great master; but\nhe being of a boisterous, fiery temper, soon broke the peace concluded\nbetween Poland with his brother Conradus \u00e0 Jungingen, whereupon\nking Uladislaus Jagellon joining forces with his father Witoldas of\nLithuania, formed an army of 150,000 fighting men and marched into\nPrussia. To stop the progress of this formidable army, the great master\ndrew up as many forces as he could, and, after the Livonians had\njoined him, found his army consisted, in a general muster, of 83,000\nwell armed stout combatants; and thus, with an undaunted spirit, he\nmarched forth to meet his enemy. Such a battle as this was never heard\nof before in these parts, and was given the 15th day of July 1410 in\nPrussia, near the town Gilgenbourg, between the two villages Tannenberg\nand Grunwald, on a large plain, with such obstinacy that, according\nto an exact computation, there were actually killed, on both sides,\n100,000 on the spot. The Poles got the victory, but lost 60,000 men.\nThe order lost 40,000,--but among them almost all their generals and\ncommanders. The great master himself, and the chief of the order, with\n600 noble german marian knights, were there slain. There is still\nkept every year a day of devotion upon that plain, in a chapel built\nto the remembrance of this battle, marked with the date of the year\nit happened, and this inscription, _Centum mille occisi_. The king of\nPoland was so weakened by this dear-bought victory that he very readily\nagreed to a peace. This memorable battle is called The Battle of\nTannenberg.\u2019\n\n[63] Moreri says, that the good duke Louis died at Monbucan on the 19th\nof August 1410. By his wife Anne, dauphiness of Auvergne and countess\nof Forez, he left John count of Clermont, his son and successor:\nhis other children, Louis and two daughters, died without issue and\nunmarried. He left also a natural son, named Hector, who was killed at\nthe siege of Soissons in 1414.\n\n[64] Boulogne, the property of the duke of Berry, by marriage with\nJane, heiress of Auvergne and Boulogne.\n\n    The county of Estampes belonged to the duke of Berry,\n    Valois, I believe, to the count d\u2019Alen\u00e7on,\n    Beaumont to the duke of Orleans,--and\n    Clermont to the duke of Bourbon.\n\n\n[65] Vinchestre, or rather Winchester,--now called Bic\u00eatre, was a\npalace built by a bishop of Winchester 1290. For further particulars,\nsee \u2018Sauval Antiquit\u00e8s de Paris\u2019, vol. ii. book vii.\n\n[66] I hardly know whether this can be the celebrated archbishop of\nRheims, and historian of the reign of Charles VI. who was one of the\nmost learned men of his time, and died at an advanced age, in 1474.\nHe had two brothers older than himself, William des Ursins, baron\nof Treynel, chancellor of France in 1445, and again in 1464,--and\nJames Juvenal des Ursins, who was archbishop of Rheims before him.\nThe history written by Juvenal des Ursins occupies the space from\n1380 to 1422, and throws great light, by comparison, on Froissart and\nMonstrelet.\n\n[67] Q. De Nesle?\n\nGuy III. de Nesle, lord of Offemont and Mello, was grand master of the\nhousehold to queen Isabella, and was killed at Agincourt. His two sons,\n_John_ III. and Guy IV. followed him in succession. He had a third son,\nwho died with him at Agincourt.\n\n[68] Monstrelet apparently mistakes. According to Moreri, _Robert_ duke\nof Bar died this year, leaving issue by his wife Mary (daughter to John\nking of France),\n\n    1. Henry lord d\u2019Ossy, who died in Hungary, 1396, leaving by his\n    wife Mary de Coucy, countess of Soissons, one son, Robert count\n    of Marle and Soissons, killed at Agincourt.\n\n    2. Philip, died in Hungary 1396.\n\n    3. Edward III. marquis du Pont, and duke of Bar after his\n    father\u2019s death.\n\n    4. Louis cardinal of Bar.\n\n    5. Charles lord of Nogent.\n\n    6. John lord of Puisaye. (Both Edward and John were killed at\n    Agincourt.)\n\n    7. Yoland, queen of Arragon.\n\n    8. Mary, countess of Namur.\n\n    9. Bona, countess of St Pol.\n\nOne striking peculiarity is discernible in this table, viz. the\npreference shown in the succession to Edward the third son, over\nRobert, son of the eldest son of the deceased duke; but this was\naccording to the law of many feudal tenures, which took no notice of\nour universally-established doctrine of _representation_ in descents.\nThe same law prevailed in Artois, and was the ground of that famous\ndecision by which Robert d\u2019Artois was ejected in the middle of the\nfourteenth century, and in consequence of which he retired in disgust\nto the court of our Edward III. who asserted the justice of his\npretensions.\n\n[69] He was a peer as duke of Burgundy, and again a peer as\ncount-palatine of Burgundy.\n\n[70] John, called count de Ligny, third son of John count of Brienne,\nbrother to the count de St Pol.\n\n[71] James de Ch\u00e2tillon was appointed admiral in 1408, in the room\nof Clugnet de Breban. He was lord of Dampierre, and son of Hugh de\nCh\u00e2tillon, formerly master of the cross-bows.\n\n[72] Nephew of duke Edward. See p. 232.\n\n[73] The advice which, according to Stowe, king Henry gave to the duke\nof Burgundy on this occasion was deserving of more attention than he\nwas disposed to pay to it. \u2018The duke of Burgoyne, desiring the king\u2019s\naid against the duke of Orliance, promised many things,--amongst the\nwhich he promised his daughter in marriage to the prince, and a great\nsum of gold with her. To whom the king answered: \u2018We advertise you not\nto fight with your enemie in this case, who justly seemeth to vexe\nyou, for the death of his father by you procured, but as much as in\nyou lyeth endeavor yourself to mitigate the young man\u2019s wrath, and\npromise to make him reasonable satisfaction, according to the advice\nof your friends; and if then he will not cease from persecuting you,\nget you into the strongest place of your dominion, and there gather\nsuch power as may be able to put off his force. If then, after this,\nhe will make war against you, you shall have the juster occasion to\nfight with him,--and in such case we will shew you such favour as yee\nhave demaunded.\u2019 Thus there were sent over to his ayde Thomas earl of\nArundell, Gilbert Umfreville earl of Angus, or earl of Kyme, sir Robert\nUmfreville, sir John Oldcastle, lord Cobham, sir John Grey and William\nPorter, with twelve hundred archers,\u2019 &c. &c.\n\n[74] According to the catalogue in Moreri, Arnauld de Corbie, lord of\nJoigny, was at this time chancellor.\n\n[75] Called William Porter by Stowe.\n\n[76] Q. If this is not _Umfreville_ earl of Angus and _Kyme_ (as Stowe\ncalls him)? There was at this period no Neville earl of Kent. The\nonly earl of Kent of that family was William Nevil lord Falconbridge,\ncreated 1461. I find this conjecture somewhat confirmed by the\noriginal, which is, \u2018Ousieville comte de Kam.\u2019 It is true, that\nHolinshed mentions the earls of Pembroke and of _Kent_ as being of the\nexpedition: but he cites Monstrelet as his authority, and is therefore\nlikely to be mistaken.\n\n[77] \u2018Que _\u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s_ elle _ne_ mourast de deuil.\u2019 \u2018That she was\nwithin a little of dying with grief.\u2019 Mary of Berry, daughter of John\nduke of Berry, and wife to John duke of Bourbon (her third husband, she\nhaving been before twice a widow, first of Louis de Ch\u00e2tillon count\nof Dunois, and, secondly, of the constable d\u2019Eu), lived till the year\n1434, when she died at Lyons. See Morery. Her children by the duke of\nBourbon were Charles, duke of Bourbon after his father,--Louis, who\ndied young,--and another Louis, founder of the line of Montpensier.\n\n[78] John II. lord of Rieux and Rochefort. According to Morery\u2019s\ncatalogue, two mareschals were created this year,--Louis lord of\nLoigny, and James lord of Heilly, commonly called Mareschal of\nAcquitaine.\n\n[79] See p. 328.\n\n\n[Transcriber's Note:\n\nInconsistent spelling and hyphenation are as in the original.\n\nSeven instances of \u201cPier-vves\u201d changed to read \u201cPier-Yves\u201d; and one\ninstance of \u201cPierre-vves\u201d changed to read \u201cPierre-Yves.\u201d]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Chronicles of Enguerrand de\nMonstrelet, Volume 2 (of 13), by Enguerrand de Monstrelet\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK CHRONICLES--ENGUERRAND MONSTRELET, VOL 2 ***\n\n***** This file should be named 52607-0.txt or 52607-0.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/5/2/6/0/52607/\n\nProduced by Wayne Hammond and The Online Distributed\nProofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net (This file was\nproduced from images generously made available by The\nInternet Archive)\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will\nbe renamed.\n\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United\nStates without permission and without paying copyright\nroyalties.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.

General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\nfreely shared with anyone.

I.\n\n    THE CONCLUSION OF THE DUCHESS OF ORLEANS\u2019 ADVOCATE AGAINST THE\n    DUKE OF BURGUNDY, AND THE REPLY FROM THE CHANCELLOR.\n\n\nThe chancellor of France, in the king\u2019s name, ordered the duchess\u2019s\nadvocate, master William Cousinot, to draw up such conclusions as\nshould be satisfactory to the duchess and her son, the duke of Orleans.\nThe advocate, after many excuses, began by showing how pitiable their\nstate was, and took for his theme part of the 7th chapter of the gospel\nof St Luke, \u2018H\u00e6c vidua erat quam cum vidisset Dominus misericordia\nmotus est super eam.\u2019\n\n\u2018Most noble prince, when our Lord entered a city called Nain, he met\nthe corpse of a young man, which his friends were carrying to the\ngrave; and when he noticed that the mother of the young man was a\nwidow, he was on this account moved with compassion toward her, and\nrestored her son to life. I may most truly apply these words to my\nlady of Orleans, for she is a widow who bewails the death of her lord\nand husband, and our lord will have compassion on her; for the king\nis our lord, in respect of terrestrial jurisdiction; and not only the\nking, but thou, lord of Acquitaine, and all other princes of this world\nhaving territorial powers, seeing my lady of Orleans thus disconsolate,\nought to feel compassion for her, and give her aid and support in\nprocuring strict justice to be done for the cruel death of her husband.\n\n\u2018In every case, and at all times, full justice should be administered\nto all; for, according to the words of the Psalmist, it is a good and\nmeritorious act,--\u2018Beati qui custodiunt judicium et faciunt justitiam\nin omni tempore.\u2019 Psalm cv.\n\n\u2018But justice should always be more rigorously observed in regard\nto widows and orphans, who have been deprived of their fathers or\nhusbands, than in any other case; for the divine, canon and civil\nlaws urge the necessity of succouring the widow and orphan. We have\nthe first instance of this in the 22d chapter of Jeremiah,--\u2018Facite\njudicium et justitiam, et liberate vi oppressum de manu calumniatoris,\npupillum et viduam,\u2019 &c.\n\n\u2018In regard to the canon law, the decrees declare, that it is very\nproper for kings to do justice and execute judgment, and deliver from\nthe hands of the oppressors widows and orphans who are injuriously used\nby them.\n\n\u2018As for the civil law, it is very clear, that widows and orphans are\nparticularly privileged in many cases, as may be seen in different law\nwritings.\n\n\u2018My lady of Orleans has lost her husband: her children have lost their\nfather, certainly one of the handsomest and most accomplished princes\nin Christendom. But let us see how they have lost him: had he been\ntaken from them by a natural death, their case would not have been so\nmuch to be pitied; but he is cut off violently in the flower of his\nyouth. In truth, this is such an outrage that every law and customary\nproceeding should bend in their favour against the malignant author of\nthe deed.\n\n\u2018In the first place, our king and sovereign lord is bounden\nparticularly by the commands of God, to whom he cannot be disobedient\nwithout sinning, to execute judgment, according to the words of\nJeremiah in the chapter before mentioned,--\u2018In memetipso juravi, dicit\nDominus, quia in solitudine erit domus vestra.\u2019 And this is conformable\nto the reply made by St Remy to king Clovis when he baptised him. The\nking asked him how long the kingdom of France would endure. The saint\nanswered, that it would last so long as justice should reign there. The\nconverse of which is, that when justice shall cease to be administered,\nthe kingdom will fall. To the king therefore may be applied what is\nwritten in the canon law, \u2018Quod justitia est illud quod suum firmat\nimperium.\u2019\n\n\u2018O, duke of Acquitaine! thou art he who, after the king, art bound\nto do justice according to the words of the Psalmist, \u2018Deus judicium\ntuum regi da et justitiam tuam filio regis.\u2019 Thou art the eldest son\nto the king, to whom, by the grace of God, thou wilt succeed, and be\nour lord: attend to our case for the love of God, for to thee more\nparticularly does it belong; and if thou dost not lay thy hand on it,\nwhen thou shalt come to reign, thou mayest find thy kingdom desolate\nand destroyed,--for each will in his turn seize parts of it, and be the\nmaster, should this atrocious crime remain unpunished.\n\n\u2018Ye also, my lords, princes, dukes and counts of the royal blood,\nrelations of the late duke, and ye other nobles, who have an affection\nfor the king\u2019s crown and honour, what ought to be your conduct on\nthis occasion? Why, certainly, if the king will not interfere in this\nmatter, ye ought to take up the business and execute judgment; for ye\nare bound by oath to guard and defend the king\u2019s honour against all who\nmay infringe upon it. This ye have done in former times, through God\u2019s\ngrace, and for which this kingdom has gained greater glory than any\nother realm in Christendom: insomuch that the English, the Germans, and\nother foreigners, have come hither to seek for justice.\n\n\u2018My lords, for the love of God, let your loyalty burst forth, according\nto your oaths, in behalf of my lady of Orleans, as she has the fullest\nconfidence it will; for, after God and the king, you are her only\nrefuge. Let no one fear to do justice, from the scandal or persecution\nthat may ensue, for it is a maxim of law, \u2018Utilius est scandalum nasci\nac permitti, quam ut veritas relinquatur,\u2019--although it were certain\nthe doing justice in this case would cause much grievous persecution\nto ensue. Yet for all this justice should not be neglected; for in\nthat case you would be indeed reproachable, if, through fear of the\noffender, you shall not dare to decree justice. On no occasion should\njustice be neglected: therefore, my lords, act according to what the\nprophet says, \u2018Viriliter agite, et confortetur cor vestrum et sustinete\nDominum.\u2019\n\n\u2018In truth, if ye do not act with courage, for one inconvenience that\nmay happen, by executing judgment, one hundred would ensue from default\nof justice. Therefore, my lords, do not hesitate to do justice to my\nlady of Orleans and her children from any dread of inconveniences\nthat may happen, but follow the dictates of our Lord,--\u2018Judicare\npupillo et humili ut non apponat magnificare se homo super terram.\u2019\nLet the punishment be so exemplary that none other may henceforth\ncommit so great or so disgraceful a crime, and that it may be held\nin perpetual memory and abhorrence. This is the object of my lady of\nOrleans and her children, namely, that the crime may be atoned for as\nheavily as possible in this world. In order that this atonement may\nbe made, my lady of Orleans and her children would willingly take the\nlegal steps for the infliction of capital punishment, if this could\nregularly be done; but as these steps, according to the customary\nusage of France, belong to the king\u2019s attorney-general alone, they\npropose that the offender shall be punished in manner following,--that\nis to say, by sentence of the king and of the court, be it ordered\nthat our adversary, the duke of Burgundy, be brought to the castle of\nthe Louvre, or elsewhere, according to the king\u2019s pleasure and that\nof my clients, and there, in the presence of the king, of my lord of\nAcquitaine, and the other princes of the blood, as well as of the\ncouncil and people, the duke of Burgundy, without hood or girdle,\nshall, on his knees, publicly confess, with a loud voice, before my\nlady of Orleans, her children, and as many other persons as she may\nplease, that maliciously and treacherously he has had my lord of\nOrleans assassinated, through hatred, envy and ambition, and for no\nother cause, notwithstanding all the charges made against him, and\nother imputations thrown on his character, to justify and exculpate\nhimself from so base a deed; and shall demand pardon from my lady of\nOrleans and her children, most humbly supplicating them to forgive his\noffences, declaring that he knows of nothing prejudicial to the honour\nand reputation of the said duke of Orleans deceased, and recals all he\nmay have said or published to the contrary.\n\n\u2018In this state he shall be carried to the court of the palace, and to\nthe h\u00f4tel de Saint Pol, the residence of the king, and to the spot\nwhere the murder was committed, and there, on high stages erected for\nthe purpose, he shall repeat the above words before such commissioners\nas my lady of Orleans and her son may please to appoint. He shall\nremain on his knees, at the last place, until priests nominated for\nthe purpose shall have recited the seven penitential psalms, said the\nlitany, and the other parts of the burial service, for the soul of the\ndeceased, after which he shall kiss the earth, and ask pardon of God,\nof my lady of Orleans, and of her children, for the offences he has\ncommitted against them.\n\n\u2018The manner and form of this recantation, and begging pardon, shall be\nwritten out, and copies sent to all the different towns in the kingdom\nwith orders for the magistrates to have them proclaimed by sound of\ntrumpet, that it may be notorious to all within and without the realm.\n\n\u2018And as additional reparations for such offences, and that they may\nremain in perpetual remembrance, all the houses belonging to the duke\nof Burgundy in Paris shall be razed to the ground, and remain in ruins\nfor ever. On the places where any of his houses shall have stood, there\nshall be erected handsome crosses of stone, having large and strong\ntablets, on which shall be written a full account of the murder of my\nlate lord, the duke of Orleans, and the cause of these houses being\ndestroyed.\n\n\u2018On the spot where my late lord was murdered shall be erected a similar\ncross; and the house wherein the murderers hid themselves shall be\npulled down. This spot, and the adjoining houses, the duke of Burgundy\nshall be forced to purchase, and to build thereon a handsome college\nfor six canons, six vicars, and six chaplains, whose nominations shall\nremain with my lady of Orleans and her heirs. In this college six\nmasses shall be said every day for the soul of the deceased duke of\nOrleans, and high mass at the usual time of canonical hours. For the\nsupport of this college there shall be a mortmain rent of one thousand\nlivres parisis; and the whole shall be well furnished with dresses,\nbooks, chalices, ornaments, and all other necessaries, at the sole\nexpense of the duke of Burgundy; and over the entrance shall be written\nin large letters the cause of its foundation.\n\n\u2018The duke of Burgundy shall, beside, be constrained to found a college\nfor the salvation of the soul of the deceased, in the town of Orleans,\nconsisting of twelve canons, twelve vicars, and twelve clerks, which\ncollege shall bear the name of the defunct; and the nominations to\nit shall belong to my lady of Orleans, and to the heirs of the late\nduke of Orleans. It shall be situated in whatever part of the late\nduke\u2019s possessions in Orleans the duchess shall please, and shall be\nhandsomely constructed, furnished with books and all other necessaries,\nwith an income of two thousand livres parisis; and a similar\ninscription to the one before mentioned shall be placed over the gate.\n\n\u2018For the greater perpetuity of this event, and that it may be made\nknown to all foreign nations, the duke of Burgundy shall be enjoined to\nerect two chapels; the one near the holy sepulchre at Jerusalem, and\nthe other at Rome, and assign to each the annual value of one hundred\nlivres in the coin of those countries, and to provide them with all\nnecessary furniture. In each of these chapels shall a daily mass be\nsaid for the soul of the deceased, and over the doors shall be placed\nthe same inscriptions as over the colleges.\n\n\u2018The duke of Burgundy shall also be constrained to pay the sum of\none million in gold, not to the profit of my lady of Orleans or her\nchildren, but to found and endow hospitals and monasteries, and to\ndistribute in alms and other works of piety for the salvation of the\nsoul of the defunct.\n\n\u2018That this sentence may be carried into due effect, all the lands\nwhich the duke of Burgundy possesses in this kingdom shall be placed\nin the hands of the king, that they may be sold for the accomplishment\nof the above works. The duke of Burgundy shall also be condemned to\nclose imprisonment in whatever place it may please the king, until\nthe above sentence be carried into execution. After which, he shall\nbe banished for ever beyond sea, or at least for the space of twenty\nyears, to bewail and repent of his crime, or until it shall be thought\nhe may have sufficiently done it. On his return, he shall be ordered,\nunder severe penalties, never to approach within one hundred leagues of\nthe queen or the children of the late duke of Orleans, without being\ncondemned to such heavy damages, and other penalties suited to the\nenormity of the case, as shall be held in perpetual remembrance. He\nshall also be condemned to pay whatever costs my lady of Orleans and\nher children may have occurred on this present occasion.\n\n\u2018I say, therefore, that such ought to be the judgment given for them,\nand without delay, considering the notoriety and enormity of the\noffence of our adversary; for it is publicly known, that the duke of\nBurgundy has confessed himself guilty of it. He first made a confession\nof his guilt to my lord of Berry and to the king of Sicily, giving no\nreason for it but that he was urged on by the devil: he then did the\nsame before several noblemen. This ought therefore to weigh against\nhim, and convict him of the crime, without further trial: nor ought\nyou to suffer any sort of colouring to be admitted in palliation of\nhis guilt. He ought not to be heard otherwise than he has been, for\nhe varied not in his confessions to the different persons; and pope\nInnocent approves of this, in his chapter on Free Will, and Guillermus\nde Montleon, in his chapter on Clerical Constitutions. Pope Nicholas\nheld king Lothaire, in like manner, convicted to his prejudice in a\ncertain case, about which he had written to the pope, as appears in\nthe above chapter. This confession of king Lothaire had been made in\na letter, previously to any trial. The duke of Burgundy, therefore,\nought to be condemned from this public confession of his crime in the\npresence of different persons. He has beside made a similar confession\nwhen he appeared publicly before thee, lord of Acquitaine, when thou\ndidst sit in judgment representing the person of the king, and before\nthe princes of the blood and all the council of state. He cannot,\ntherefore, deny his having made such confession before competent\njudges. It follows then, that no further trial is necessary, but that\nsentence should immediately be passed; for confession of guilt should\nbe judged the fullest evidence.\n\n\u2018The law says, \u2018In confitentem null\u00e6 sunt partes judicantis.\u2019 And\nsupposing, that according to some, a sentence is requisite, at least\nit is certain that no trial or examination of the cause is necessary,\nsince this present case is extremely notorious. So has it formerly been\ndetermined by the sentence and judgment of the kings in times past,\nagainst several great lords of their day,--to wit, that when the facts\nwere notorious, no other process or inquisition was required. And so\nshall it be determined, by the grace of God, in the present case,--for\nso reason demands.\n\n\u2018Should it, however, be thought necessary to go into another trial,\nwhich, from all I have said, I cannot suppose, my lady of Orleans\nis ready prepared to bring forward the fullest proof of what I have\nadvanced, and such as must convince all reasonable persons. But as my\nlady can now only offer civil conclusions, and would willingly propose\ncriminal ones, but that it belongs to the king\u2019s attorney-general\naccording to the usage in France,--my lady, therefore, most earnestly\nsupplicates the king\u2019s attorney to join with her, and propose such\nsentence as the law in this case requires.\u2019\n\nThese were the conclusions of my lady of Orleans and her sons,--after\nwhich, the council of the princes of the blood, and others of the\nking\u2019s council, with the approbation of the duke of Acquitaine, made\nthe chancellor reply to the duchess of Orleans, that the duke of\nAcquitaine, as lieutenant for the king, and representing his person,\nand the princes of the blood-royal were well satisfied with her\nconduct respecting her late lord the duke of Orleans: that they held\nhim perfectly exculpated from all the charges that had been brought\nagainst him; and that, in regard to her requests, speedy and good\njustice should be done her, so that she should be reasonably contented\ntherewith.\n\nA few days after, the young duke of Orleans, Charles, did homage for\nthe duchy of Orleans, and all his other possessions, to his uncle\nCharles king of France: then, taking leave of the queen and dauphin,\nand the princes of the blood who were in Paris, he departed with his\nmen at arms for Blois, whence he had come. The duchess-dowager of\nOrleans remained in Paris.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. II.\n\n    GUYE DE ROVE, ARCHBISHOP OF RHEIMS, APPEALS FROM THE\n    CONSTITUTIONS DRAWN UP BY THE UNIVERSITY OF PARIS, WHICH ANGERS\n    THAT BODY, AND THEY IMPRISON HIS COMMISSARY.\n\n\nAt this period, Guy de Roye[1], archbishop of Rheims, who had been\nsummoned specially by the king to attend the meeting of the prelates at\nParis, assembled to consider on the means of uniting the whole church,\nneither came himself nor sent any one in his behalf. He refused to\nagree to the decisions of this council, and sent a chaplain as his\ncommissary, with letters signed with his name and seal, to confirm his\nopposition to all the statutes they had drawn up, as well for himself\nand his diocese as for all his subjects within the province.\n\nThe king and the clergy were much displeased at this conduct; and the\nuniversity of Paris requested that the commissary should be confined in\nclose imprisonment, where he remained for a long time.\n\nThe cardinal of Bordeaux came at this time to Paris, partly for the\nunion of the church; and then also returned thither master Peter Paoul,\nand the patriarch of Alexandria, named master Symon Cramant, who\nhad been sent by the king of France and the university of Paris, as\nambassadors to the two rival popes.\n\nThe assembled prelates were very anxious for their arrival, that they\nmight be better acquainted with the business they had to manage, and on\nwhat grounds they should proceed. Master Peter Paoul frequently rode\nthrough the streets of Paris in his doctor\u2019s dress, accompanied by the\ncardinal riding on one side of his horse as women do. In the presence\nof this cardinal and doctor, the abbot of Caudebec, of the order of\nCistercians, and doctor in theology, proposed, on the part of the\nuniversity, an union of the church. The abbot of St Denis, with other\ndoctors in theology, declared for an union of the universal church;\nand, shortly after, the cardinal departed from Paris for Boulogne, and\nthence went to Calais.\n\nThe abbot of St Denis and another doctor of theology, who had been, by\nthe king\u2019s orders, confined in the prison of the Louvre, were released,\nat the request of the cardinal de Bar, and set at liberty, contrary to\nthe will of the university of Paris. In like manner did the bishop of\nCambray, master Peter d\u2019Ailly, an excellent doctor of theology, gain\nhis liberty. He had been confined at the instance of the university,\nbecause he was not favourable to their sentiments, and was delivered\nat the entreaties of count Waleran de St Pol, and the great council of\nthe king. All Christendom was now divided in religious opinions, as\nto the head of the church, by the contentions of the two rival popes,\nwho could not be brought to agree on the means to put an end to this\ndisgraceful schism.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. III.\n\n    THE DUKE OF BURGUNDY ASSEMBLES A LARGE BODY OF MEN AT ARMS TO\n    SUCCOUR JOHN OF BAVARIA AGAINST THE LIEGEOIS, AND COMBATS THEM.\n\n\nAbout this time, John duke of Burgundy was busily employed in\ncollecting a body of men at arms to aid his brother-in-law, the bishop\nof Liege, whom, as has been said, the Liegeois had driven out of their\ncountry, and besieged in the town of Maestricht. He sent for succour\namong his friends and allies, namely, to Burgundy, Flanders, Artois,\nand the borders of Picardy, whence came very many, and several from\nSavoy.\n\nThe earl of Mar, also, a Scotsman, then at Bruges, with about four\nscore combatants, ready to embark for Scotland, advanced into the\nTournesis, whither the duke came, and had a conference with their\nprincipal captains in the town of Tournay.\n\nOn the eleventh day of September, he marched thence with a\nnumerous body of men at arms, and a great train of artillery and\nbaggage-waggons to Enghien, where he was gladly received by the lord\nof the place. On the morrow, he advanced to Nivelle in Brabant, within\na league of Salmes. He marched next to Flourines, where he met sir\nRichard[2] Daulphin, sir William de Tignonville, lately provost of\nParis, and master William Bouratier, one of the king\u2019s secretaries,\nambassadors to him from the king of France. Having obtained an\naudience, they said they had been sent to him from the king and the\ngreat council on two objects; first, to know whether the Liegeois and\ntheir bishop were willing to submit their differences to the king and\nthe great council; secondly, to inform him of the suit urged against\nhim by the duchess-dowager of Orleans and her children, for the death\nof the late duke of Orleans, his brother, of the replies they had made\nto the charges he had brought against the late duke, and that they\ndemanded instant justice on him the duke of Burgundy, and that neither\nlaw nor reason ought to prevent sentence being passed by the king\naccording to the conclusions that had been drawn up against him.\n\nThe duke of Burgundy shortly answered, that in regard to the first\npoint, he was willing, as was right for him to do, to obey the king\u2019s\norders, but that his brother-in-law, John of Bavaria, who had married\nhis sister, had most earnestly solicited his assistance against the\ncommonalty and his subjects of Liege, who had rebelled, and even held\nhim besieged. Similar requests had been made to duke William, count\nof Hainault, his brother in law, and also brother-in-law to John of\nBavaria: wherefore the armaments could not now be broken up, since\nduring the time the ambassadors would be negotiating between the two\nparties, John of Bavaria, their bishop and lord, might be in great\ndanger from his rebellious subjects, and their success might serve for\nan example and inducement for other subjects to resist their lords, and\ngive rise to an universal rebellion. He added, that the king and his\ncouncil might, without any prejudice to themselves, have refrained from\nso readily listening to such requests, as none of the aforesaid parties\nwere subjects to the kingdom of France.\n\nIn regard to the second point, he, John duke of Burgundy, made answer,\nthat instantly on his return from this expedition he would wait on\nthe king of France, and act towards him, and all others, in a manner\nbecoming a good subject, and the near relationship in which he stood to\nthe king.\n\nThe ambassadors, finding they could not obtain more satisfactory\nanswers to the points on which they were sent, were obliged to be\ncontented. They resolved, however, to wait the event of this expedition\nagainst the Liegeois; and during that time there came to the duke\nof Burgundy, from the country of Hainault, his brother-in-law duke\nWilliam, accompanied by the counts de Conversan, de Namur, and de\nSalines, in Ardennes, with many notable lords, as well knights as\nesquires, from Hainault, Holland, Zealand, Ostrevant, and other\nplaces, to the number of twelve hundred helmets[3], or thereabout, and\ntwo thousand infantry well equipped, with from five to six hundred\ncarriages laden with provision and military stores.\n\nMany councils were held at Flourines, and in that neighbourhood, as\nto their future conduct, and whither they might march their army\nwith the greatest probability of success. It was determined that duke\nWilliam should command the van, and, as he advanced, destroy the whole\ncountry with fire and sword; that the duke of Burgundy, with the earl\nof Mar and the main body, should direct their march along the causeway\nof Branchaut, which leads strait to Tongres and Maestricht. In the\nlast place, the lord de Pier-Yves[4] and the Liegeois had, as has been\nbefore said, besieged their bishop and lord, John of Bavaria.\n\nIn consequence of this resolution, the two dukes began their march\nby different roads, and destroyed all the country on the Tuesday,\nWednesday and Thursday, and met on the Saturday evening, about vespers,\nin the town of Montenach, situated on the above causeway. In this\nplace and neighbourhood was the whole army lodged, forming but one\nbody; and two marshals were appointed to command and find quarters for\nit;--on the part of the duke of Burgundy, the lord de Vergy[5],--and\non that of duke William, the lord de Jeumont. They had under their\nimmediate orders five hundred helmets, seven hundred cross-bows, and\nfifteen hundred archers, all men of tried courage, with sixteen hundred\ncarriages, as well carts as waggons, laden with arms, ammunition and\nprovision, and all other necessaries for such an expedition.\n\nOn this Saturday, the lord de Pier-Yves, and his son the newly-elected\nbishop of Liege, as they were besieging Maestricht, learnt from their\nspies, that the two before-mentioned dukes were rapidly advancing\nagainst them, and burning the country on their line of march. They\ninstantly raised the siege, and retreated to the city of Liege with\nfull forty thousand combatants, where they fixed their quarters, Liege\nbeing only five leagues distant from Maestricht. The commanders there\nheld a council, with such of the inhabitants as had not been at the\nsiege; and at its close it was proclaimed through different parts of\nthe town, by orders of the governor and his son, the bishop, that every\nman capable of bearing arms should, on the morrow-morning, at the sound\nof a bell, be ready equipped to follow their commanders out of the town\nwhithersoever they might lead them.\n\nIn consequence of this order, on the morrow, the 22d day of September\n1408, there issued out of Liege, according to computation, about fifty\nthousand armed men. In this number were from five to six hundred well\narmed, in the french manner, on horseback, and from one hundred to six\nscore english archers, in their pay. They were followed by infinite\nnumbers of carts and other carriages, and a mob of people dressed in\nvarious manners, according to their own fancies.\n\nThe bell tolled at break of day, and they then sallied forth in good\narray, following their governor and bishop, very eager to offer combat\nto the enemy. Their governor had frequently warned them of the dangers\nthat might ensue from a battle, as their enemies were, for the greater\npart, nobles or gentlemen accustomed to war and obedience to their\ncommanders, which was not the case with them; and that it would be more\nto their advantage to remain within well-inclosed towns and castles\nharrassing the enemy by various means, and so tiring him out that he\nshould be forced to quit their country.\n\nThis advice, however, was not agreeable to the Liegeois, for it seemed\nto them that their numbers were so great that the enemy could not\nresist them; and they were not well pleased with what their governor\nhad told them. The governor, perceiving the Liegeois determined on\nbattle, led them into the plain, and drew them up in handsome array. He\nfrequently exhorted them to behave themselves valiantly, and with one\naccord, this day against the enemy, who was marching to attack them,\nand to defend with courage their lives and liberties.\n\nThey marched near to Tongres, which is five leagues distant from Liege,\nwhither the two dukes had advanced on the Saturday; for they had\nalready heard the siege of Maestricht was broken up, and that the men\nof Liege were intending to offer them battle. After some councils had\nbeen holden with the captains and the most experienced in their army,\nthey sent off, very early on the Sunday morning, two hundred light\ntroops, under the command of Robert le Roux and some other noblemen\nof the country, to inquire into the truth of what they had heard, and\nto see what the enemy was about. They shortly returned, and told the\ndukes, that the intelligence they had received was true, for that they\nhad seen the Liegeois in great numbers marching in battle-array. The\ndukes, on hearing this, commanded their men to arm, and to draw up in\norder of battle. When this was done, they marched to meet the Liegeois,\nand scarcely had they advanced half a league when they appeared in\nsight.\n\nThe Liegeois also saw them, for they were near to Tongres. Both armies\nadvancing, the dukes then posted themselves and all their infantry\non a very advantageous spot; and thinking the enemy would attempt to\ndislodge them, they formed their army into one battalion, the better to\nsupport the attack, and placed their baggage in their rear. They posted\nthe greater part of their archers and cross-bows on their right and\nleft as wings. The lord de Miraumont this day commanded the archers, by\norders of the duke of Burgundy, and with great credit to himself. The\nduke of Burgundy was on the right, and duke William on the left of the\narmy, each attended by his own people.\n\nAfter the proper orders had been given, and every arrangement made\naccording to the advice of the most experienced officers, very many\nnew knights were created. The men of Liege, swelled with pride, and\narrogantly considering the army of their opponents as infinitely\ninferior to them, marched on the right for an eminence called the\nheights of Hasbane, where they halted in handsome array. They had with\nthem the standard of St Lambert, and those of their different guilds;\nand the reason why they had halted on this spot was, that some of their\nold men had told them that it was there their ancestors had gained a\nvictory, and they flattered themselves with similar success.\n\nThey then formed their army in handsome order, and played off many\ncannons against their enemies, which annoyed them very much. It should\nbe known, that between the two armies was a narrow valley, at the\nbottom of which was a ditch to carry off the water in times of rain.\n\nThe two dukes having with their army remained stationary, observing\nthat the Liegeois did not seem inclined to quit their position, and\nbegin the battle, held a short council with their ablest officers,\nand thinking success was more likely to follow the most courageous,\ndetermined to advance slowly toward them in battle-array, on account of\nthe weight of their arms, and attack them where they were, before they\ncould fortify themselves, or increase their numbers by reinforcements.\n\nIn consequence, five hundred men at arms, on horseback, were ordered to\nattack the army of Liege on its rear, and about a thousand infantry,\nunder the command of the lords de Croy, de Helly, de Neufville and de\nRaise, knights, with Enguerrand de Bournouville, esquire, on the part\nof the duke of Burgundy; and by the lords de Hamette and de Ligne,\nknights, with Robert le Roux, esquire, who instantly advanced into the\nplain according to their orders.\n\nThe Liegeois, observing so large a detachment quit the duke\u2019s army,\nand march away, as it were, thought they were running off from fear\nof their great numbers, and began shouting, in their language, \u2018Fuyo,\nfuyo!\u2019 and repeating this word many times. The lord de Pier-Yves, the\ngovernor, like an able man, well versed in war, frequently, but gently,\nchecked them for making this noise, saying, \u2018My very dear friends,\nthat troop on horseback which you see, are not running away, as you\nsuppose; but when that other body of infantry, much greater, as you\nmay observe, shall be advanced near enough to begin the attack, those\non horseback will instantly wheel about, like skilful soldiers, and\ncharge your rear, with a design to divide your army, while the others\nshall attack you in front. Notwithstanding we have every appearance\nof a successful issue to our battle, I have always advised you to the\ncontrary; and though your hearts are set upon it, as if already sure\nof victory, I remain still in the same opinion,--because you are not\nso well used to warfare, nor armed like to your adversaries, who have\nlearnt all military exercises from their childhood. This was the reason\nwhy I proposed avoiding a battle; for it would have been more to your\nadvantage to have defended your towns and fortresses, and whenever a\nfavourable opportunity offered, to have fallen on your enemies, so that\nthey would have been forced to have quitted your country. However, the\nday you have so ardently wished for is now come; and I beg of you to\nput your hopes in God, and boldly and steadily exert yourselves in the\ndefence of your country against the enemy now marching to attack you.\u2019\n\nHaving finished this speech, he wanted to mount some of his most\ndetermined men on horseback to oppose the detachment then on the\nplain; but in truth the commonalty would not suffer it to be done, and\nuttered against him many reproaches, calling him a traitor.\n\nHe patiently suffered their rude ignorance, and hastily commanded the\narmy to be formed into a square, in the front of which was a body drawn\nup in the form of a triangle,--and the carts and baggage were towards\nthe rear, on the right and left of his army, handsomely arranged: their\nhorses were in the rear, on one of the wings, intermixed with their\narchers and cross-bows,--but they were of little value, except the\nenglish archers, who were better disposed of in other places.\n\nThe lord de Pier-Yves, accompanied by his son the bishop and some of\nhis best companions in arms, like a good commander, posted himself at\nthe head of his army, fronting the enemy.\n\nDuring this time, the two dukes began their march, gaily exhorting\ntheir men to behave themselves gallantly against the enemy, a rude\nand ignorant people, who had rebelled against their lord, and who\nconfidently trusted in their superior numbers for success,--telling\ntheir men, that if they acted as they expected they would, victory\nwould infallibly be theirs, and they would gain everlasting honour.\n\nWhen the dukes had made such like speeches, they retired to their\nposts, and under their banners, and advanced slowly toward the enemy,\nwho kept up a heavy fire against them with their cannons.\n\nThe banner-bearer of the duke of Burgundy was a very valiant knight,\ncalled sir James de Courtjambe, who, accidentally falling on his knees\nas he marched, alarmed many, who thought it was an unfavourable omen\nof their success; but he was soon raised by the help of those of his\nguard, and behaved himself honourably the whole day. This knight was a\nnative of Burgundy. The banner of duke William was that day borne by\na gallant knight, called sir Hoste d\u2019Escaussines, who behaved himself\nright well.\n\nWhen the two armies met, the conflict became very severe on each side,\nand lasted for upwards of an hour, when many deadly blows were given\nby both parties. At this moment, the detachment on horseback, with\nthe infantry, according to their orders, advanced to the rear of the\nLiegeois; but from the position of their baggage-waggons, they had\nmuch difficulty to force their way. At length, by dint of courage, they\nsucceeded, and, having gained an entrance, began to lay about them so\nvigorously that the army of the enemy was divided,--and they saw full\nsix thousand Liegeois quit their ranks, with their guns and the banners\nof their guilds, and take flight with all speed towards a village half\na league from the field of battle.\n\nWhen the detachment perceived this, they left off the attack they had\nbegun, and pursued the runaways, whom they charged, not once, but\nseveral times, beating down and slaying them without mercy,--and, in\nshort, routed them so effectually that, through fear of death, they\nfled here and there, into woods and other places, to hide themselves.\n\nThis party of the Liegeois being either killed, dispersed, or taken\nprisoners, the horsemen returned to their main body, gallantly fighting\nthe enemy, who, it must be said, defended themselves courageously. In\ntruth, the event of this battle was some time doubtful,--for, during\none half hour, it could not be known which side would be victorious.\nThe noise of their war-cries was frightful:--the Burgundians and\nHainaulters shouted under their banners, \u2018Our Lady for Burgundy! Our\nLady for Hainault!\u2019 and the Liegeois, in their turn, shouted, \u2018St\nLambert for Pier-Yves!\u2019\n\nThe men of Liege would perhaps have conquered, if this detachment on\nhorseback, when returned from the defeat of the runaways, had not again\nfallen on their rear, and behaved so marvellously well that those who\nopposed them were pierced through, and all attempts to check them were\nvain. A great slaughter was made by them in a short time, for none were\nadmitted to ransom; and by their vigour whole ranks fell one over the\nother, for now all the weight and power of the infantry were brought\nagainst them.\n\nThe defeat once begun, there were such heaps of dead and wounded that\nit was melancholy to behold, for they were thicker in many places than\nstooks of corn in harvest. This ought not to occasion surprise; for\nwhen the common people are assembled, badly armed, and puffed up with\ntheir extravagant desires, although they be in great numbers, yet shall\nthey hardly be able to resist an army composed of noblemen well tried\nin arms, even when God shall permit it so to be. At this period of\nthe battle, and near to the banner of the duke of Burgundy, where the\nconflict was the strongest, fell the lord de Pierre-Yves and his two\nsons,--namely, the one who had been elected bishop of Liege and his\nbrother: they were instantly put to death.\n\nThe heir of Salmes[6], who bore the standard of St Lambert, namely,\nthe eldest son to the count de Salmes[6], who was in the army of the\ntwo dukes; sir John Collet, and many other knights and esquires to\nthe amount of upwards of five hundred; all the english archers, and\nabout twenty-eight thousand of the commonalty, were left dead on the\nfield,--and more perished by arrow-shots than by any other weapon.\n\nSir Baldwin de Montgardin, knight, to save his life, surrendered\nhimself to the duke of Burgundy:--he was led out of the engagement, and\nafterward given by the duke to sir Wicart de Bours.\n\nI have no need to particularise the great courage and coolness of the\nduke of Burgundy, nor how he galloped to different parts of the army,\nexhorting them to act well,--nor how, until the end of the battle,\nhe most gallantly behaved himself,--for in truth, his conduct was\nsuch that he was praised and spoken of by all knights and others;\nand although he was frequently covered with arrows and other missile\nweapons, he did not on that day lose one drop of blood.\n\nWhen he was asked after the defeat, if they should cease from slaying\nthe Liegeois, he replied, \u2018Let them all die together! for I will not\nthat any prisoners be made, nor that any be ransomed!!\u2019\n\nIn the like gallant manner did duke William, the other princes, and in\ngeneral the whole body of the chivalry and nobility of the two dukes\nbehave themselves. There were slain from five to six hundred of their\nmen; and among the number were, John de la Chapelle, knight to the\nabove duke,--sir Flourimont de Brimeu, John de la Trimouille, who on\nthis day had been made a knight,--Hugotin de Nambon, John de Theune,\nviscount de Brimequet, a native of Hainault,--Rollant de la Mote, and\nothers, to the amount of one hundred and six score gentlemen: the rest\nwere varlets[7].\n\nJust as the dukes had gained the victory, about two thousand men made\na sally from Tongres, to assist the Liegemen. When they saw they were\ndefeated, they retreated to their town, but were so closely pursued by\nthe body of horse that had done such essential service that very many\nof them were killed.\n\nThe two dukes, seeing their victory was now complete, met, and returned\nthanks to the Creator, congratulating with one another for their\nsuccess. They had tents pitched on the field of battle, and remained\nthere for three days and three nights.\n\nThe french ambassadors, having now taken their leave, departed for\nTournay, and continued their road to Paris to the king and his council;\nbut prior to their departure, the duke of Burgundy had dispatched a\nmessenger to the king of France, with letters to inform him and his\ngood friends in Paris of the fortunate event of the battle. This news\nwas not very agreeable to many who were intending to urge the king\nto prosecute the duke of Burgundy for the murder of the late duke of\nOrleans,--and on the contrary, it gave great joy to his friends.\n\nOn Monday, the morrow of the battle, about the hour of twelve, John\nof Bavaria, bishop of Liege, attended by the heir of Heinseberg, and\nseveral others, nobles and not nobles, to the number of six hundred\nhelmets, or thereabout, came from the town of Maestricht, wherein\nthey had been besieged, to the camp of the two dukes, and most humbly\nthanked them for the succour they had afforded him. He and his party\nwere received with much joy; and, on his arrival, he was presented with\nthe head of the lord de Pier-Yves, which had been found among the dead,\nwith his two sons, and was fixed to the top of a lance, that all who\npleased might see it!\n\nOn the following Tuesday, the feast of St Fremin, a martyr, the\ninhabitants of Liege, Huy, Dinant and Tongres, and of all the other\ngood towns in the bishoprick of Liege, excepting the castle of\nBouillon, hearing of the great destruction of their countrymen, and the\npower of their enemies, were panic-struck, and, seeing no probability\nof any assistance, surrendered themselves to the obedience of the dukes\nof Burgundy and of Holland. They sent to them ambassadors to this\neffect, and also to supplicate John of Bavaria, their bishop and lord,\nthat he would graciously have pity upon them, and grant them his pardon.\n\nThe bishop, through the intercession of the two dukes, complied with\ntheir request, on condition that such as had been most active in\npromoting the rebellion, many of whom were still alive, whose names\nthey would set down, should be given up to the two dukes, to do by them\nas they in their justice should think right; and each of the towns gave\nsufficient hostages for the due performance of the terms.\n\nOn the ensuing Thursday, the two dukes and the bishop, with the whole\narmy, broke up the camp, and advanced toward the town of Liege. The\nduke of Burgundy was quartered in the town of Flauye, on the river\nMeuse, one league distant from Liege, and duke William among the\nmountains.\n\nOn the following Sunday, the dukes and the bishop held a full council,\nto which all their ministers were admitted, on the present state of\naffairs. Other councils were continued until the Tuesday, when the\nbishop made his entry into Liege, and was received with great humility\nby the remnant of its inhabitants. The most culpable in the late\nrebellion had been before arrested and thrown into prison in this and\nin all the other towns.\n\nThe bishop went first to the cathedral church of St Lambert to offer\nhis prayers, and reconcile himself with the chapter: after this he went\nto his palace, when he was most humbly entreated by the people to have\nmercy on them, which he granted; and, shortly after, he returned to the\ncamp of the two dukes.\n\nAbout two o\u2019clock in the afternoon, on the morrow, the dukes and the\nbishop, with several nobles of the army, assembled on an elevated spot\nnear the camp, whither sir John de Jeumont, marshal to duke William,\nby the commands of the two dukes and the bishop, had ordered the heir\nof Rochefort, a rich nobleman, John de Saramie[8], knight, and fifteen\nother citizens, to be brought from the town, and had their heads cut\noff, one after another, by the executioner. Many churchmen, and some\nwomen, were also drowned in the Meuse for having been concerned in the\nrebellion!\n\nOn the morrow, the dukes and the bishop moved with the army to a town\nthree leagues distant, called Beaucloquet, where many conferences\nwere held, on the state of the country. The count de Nevers joined\nhis brother, the duke of Burgundy, at this place, with four hundred\ncombatants. Hither also sir John de Jeumont ordered nineteen citizens\nfrom the town of Huy to be brought, who underwent a similar punishment\nto those of Liege, and for the same cause; and, as before, many\nchurchmen and women were drowned[9].\n\nAm\u00e9 de Viry, a Savoyard, a nobleman well experienced in war, came\nhither also to aid the duke of Burgundy, and accompanied by three\nhundred helmets from that country. When the dukes and the bishop had\nfor several days consulted together on the affairs of Liege, it was at\nlength concluded, with the approbation of John of Bavaria, now surnamed\nJohn the Pitiless, that they should all meet again in the city of\nTournay, on St Luke\u2019s day next ensuing, to determine finally on the\nmeasures to be pursued touching these matters.\n\nAfter many executions had taken place in the bishoprick of Liege\non those who had been concerned in the rebellion, and when the\nfortifications of the towns of Huy, Dinant and others, had been\ndestroyed, the two dukes began their march homeward, taking with them\na number of persons from Liege, who had been given as hostages for the\nobservance of all the articles of the treaty that should be made with\nthem. Some of them were sent by duke William to Mons and Valenciennes,\nand some to Lille, Arras, and other places belonging to the duke of\nBurgundy, who went to his county of Flanders, and duke William to\nHainault, after they had disbanded their men at arms. The greater part\nreturned to their homes much enriched by the plunder of the Liegeois,\nwho, thunderstruck by the misfortune that had befallen them, became\nstupified and indolent.\n\nMany great lords attended the duke of Burgundy on this expedition:\namong them were, from Burgundy, sir John de Ch\u00e2lons[10], sir Gaultier\nde Ruples, the lord de Vergy[11], marshal of Burgundy, the lord de St\nGeorge, sir John de la Balme[12], sir William de Champ-divers, sir\nJames de Courtjambe, the lord de Montagu, and many more. From Picardy,\nthe lords de Croy[13], de Heilly, de Fosseux, de Vaurin, sir Bort\nGuieret and his brothers, the lord of Inchy, the lord of Raisse, the\nlord de Brimeu, sir Regnault de Crequy lord of Comtes[14], Enguerrand\nde Bournouville, the lord de Ront, sir Raoul de Flandres, the lord de\nPoix, sir Wincart de Bours, the lord d\u2019Auxy, the lord de Mailly, the\nlord de Thiennes and the lord d\u2019Azincourt. From Flanders, sir John and\nsir Louis de Guystelle, the lord de Hames, sir John de Bailleul, sir\nCollart de Fosseux, and others, the principal nobles of the country.\n\nIn like manner, duke William had assembled his nobles, with many\nothers, his allies; among whom was sir John de Bethune, brother to the\nviscount de Meaux. Common report said, that Anthony duke of Brabant,\nbrother to the duke of Burgundy, and Waleran de Luxembourg count\nde St Pol, had refused their assistance, because they had not been\nmade acquainted with the terms and agreements entered into by John\nof Bavaria on the one part, and the lord de Pier-Yves on the other,\nfor the resignation of the bishoprick of Liege. They also made other\nexcuses.\n\nWhen the day appointed for the meeting of the duke of Burgundy, duke\nWilliam and the bishop of Liege, in the town of Tournay, for the final\nsettlement of the affairs of Liege drew near, the inhabitants of\nthat town sent them a petition, by ambassadors chosen from among the\nprincipal citizens, to request they would fix on some other town, as\nthe numbers of their attendants would greatly harrass and impoverish\nthem, considering the very small stock of provision that was in\nTournay. Their request was granted,--and the town of Lille was chosen\nfor their meeting on the day that had before been fixed on.\n\nThither all the hostages from Liege were conducted, and brought into\nthe presence of the aforesaid dukes and bishop, with several more that\nhad been deputed to hear what judgment should be given, which was as\nfollows:\n\n\u2018The dukes of Burgundy and Holland declare, that this their judgment\nshall be punctually fulfilled in every respect, with regard to the\npresent time, reserving to themselves the power of making any future\nalterations in it as often as, and in what manner, they shall please.\n\n\u2018First, They consent that the inhabitants of Liege, of the towns and\ncountry of that bishoprick, situated within the district of Liege,\nthe country of Los, the countries of Hasbane, St Tron, the territory\nof Bouillon, shall enjoy their customary franchises and privileges.\nThey order, that the citizens of Liege, and of the other towns above\nnamed, do bring to the monastery des Escolliers, in the town of Mons\nin Hainault, on the morrow of Martinmas-day next ensuing, all the\nletters patent and charters of their laws and privileges, which they\npossess,--which they will deliver into the hands of such as may be\ncommissioned by the said dukes to receive them. Those who bring them\nshall make oath, on the salvation of their own souls, and of the souls\nof them who sent them, that they have not fraudulently left behind any\ncharters of their laws and privileges.\n\n\u2018Item, the dukes aforesaid declare, that should the city of Liege, or\nany other town, neglect to send, or fraudulently retain, any of their\ncharters, that town so retaining them shall be for ever deprived of its\nprivileges and particular laws.\n\n\u2018Item, the lords aforesaid will, that these charters and letters\npatent be delivered to the commissioners punctually on the morrow of\nMartinmas-day.\n\n\u2018Item, they likewise ordain, that when these charters and privileges\nshall have been duly examined, and new ones drawn up and delivered,\nneither the bishop of Liege nor his chapter shall grant any new\nprivileges to the inhabitants, without the consent of the two dukes or\ntheir successors.\n\n\u2018Item, they also ordain, that henceforward the commonalty shall not\nappoint or nominate, in the aforesaid towns and bishoprick, any\nofficers, such as governors, masters of trades, doctors of arts,--but\nthat from this day all such offices be annulled.\n\n\u2018Item, they ordain, that all bailiffs, provosts, mayors, and others\nbearing similar titles, shall be nominated by the bishop of Liege\nand the count de Los;--and also, that the sheriffs in such towns as\nclaim the right of shrievalty shall be renewed yearly, and a certain\nnumber appointed according to the exigency of the case and size of the\ntowns. In no large town shall father and son, two brothers-in-law, two\ncousins-german, the uncle and nephew, nor anyone who has married the\nmother of another, be appointed sheriffs at the same time, in order\nthat no improper favours be shewn from partiality of kindred. All\nofficers shall swear solemnly on their creation, to preserve and abide\nby every article and point contained in the constitution delivered to\nthem.\n\n\u2018Item, they ordain, that the bishop of Liege may, each year, at the\nexpiration of the shrievalty, appoint such sheriffs as he shall please,\nor re-appoint those of the preceding year, or others according to his\ngood pleasure, provided they are not any way connected by blood, as\nhas been before mentioned. All disputes respecting the persons or\nfortunes of the inhabitants of the different towns having sheriffs,\nshall be brought before their jurisdictions,--and at the end of the\nyear, the sheriffs shall be bound to render an account of their\nadministration before their lord, the bishop of Liege, or his deputies,\nand before one commissary deputed by the chapter, and another on the\npart of the different churches.\n\n\u2018Item, they ordain, that all guilds and fraternities in the city of\nLiege, and in all the other towns, shall henceforth cease and be\nannulled; and that the banners of the above guilds in Liege shall be\ndelivered up to commissaries, on an appointed day that shall be made\nknown to them; and the banners of the other towns shall be brought\nby the inhabitants to a certain place on an appointed day, to the\ncommissioners named to receive them, and who shall do with them as they\nmay judge expedient.\n\n\u2018Item, they also ordain, that in the above city, and in the towns\nwithin the said bishoprick, no one shall be reputed a citizen unless\nhe shall have really resided within such town in which he shall claim\nhis right of citizenship. And all such rights of citizenship are for\nthe present annulled; for although there may be resident citizens in\nthe aforesaid towns, they cannot, in such right, claim any moveables by\nreason of inheritance, without the cognizance of the lords under whom\nsuch persons have lived, and in whose territory such inheritances are\nsituated.\n\n\u2018Item, they ordain, that from this moment, and in times to come, the\ntowns of Huy, Dinant, and others within the territory of Liege, the\ncountry of Los, the country of Hasbane, and all within the jurisdiction\nof Liege, shall no longer call together any assembly, or congregation\nof people, under pretence of holding councils or otherwise, without the\nconsent of their aforesaid bishop and lord, or of the chapter of Liege,\nshould the bishoprick at the time be vacant.\n\n\u2018Item, they ordain, that the bishop of Liege, or any others having the\ngovernment of the said territory and its dependancies, shall never bear\narms against the king or kings of France, their successors; nor against\nthe two said dukes, their successors in the said duchies and counties;\nnor against the count de Namur for the time being, or his successors;\nnor against any of the countries, of the aforesaid, except when ordered\nby the emperor, and only when the emperor shall be himself present:\nprovided, nevertheless, that the king of France and the above-mentioned\npersons do not invade the territories of the bishop and chapter of\nLiege.\n\n\u2018Item, they likewise ordain, that in perpetual remembrance of this\nvictory, and the conquest made over them by the above two dukes, they\nand their successors shall have a free passage, whenever they may\nchoose to cross the river Meuse, through all towns in the territory of\nLiege, fortified or not, and with a body of men at arms or with few\nattendants according to their pleasure,--provided they do not permit\nany of the inhabitants of the said towns, villages, or country through\nwhich they shall pass, to be any way molested by their men,--and\nprovisions shall be found them for their money, without demanding\nhigher prices for the articles than they are usually sold for.\n\n\u2018Item, they ordain, that the coin of the aforesaid dukes and their\nsuccessors shall have free currency throughout the territories and\ndependancies of the bishop and chapter of Liege.\n\n\u2018Item, they ordain, that a chapel shall be erected on the spot where\nthe last victory was gained, and funds allotted for the support of four\nchaplains and two priests; and the said chapels shall be furnished\nwith chasubles, chalices, and other ornaments for celebrating mass\nand such other divine services as shall be thought advisable for the\neternal welfare of the souls of those who were slain in that battle.\nThe nomination to the above benefices shall remain with the two dukes,\naccording to regulations which they shall hereafter make between\nthemselves,--the Liegeois only to be once at the expense of providing\nthis chapel with sacred vessels and ornaments. The bishop of Liege\nshall allot from his revenues two hundred golden crowns of annual rent\nfor the support of the four chaplains and two priests; that is to say,\nfor each chaplain forty crowns, for each priest ten crowns, and for the\nrepairs of the chapel twenty crowns.\n\n\u2018Item, the said dukes will, that on the twenty-third day of every month\nof September, on which day the battle took place, a mass shall be\ncelebrated to the blessed Virgin, with great solemnity, by the provost\nor dean of the church of St Lambert, in Liege, who shall chaunt it in\nthe choir and at the grand altar, in commemoration of this victory,\nand for the welfare of the souls of those who fell in battle. The same\nshall be required of all the churches and chapels to monasteries, as\nwell for men as women, within the said town of Liege, as of all others\nwithin its jurisdiction.\n\n\u2018Item, the said dukes require from the bishop of Liege and the chapter,\nthat they strictly enjoin such services to be regularly performed on\nevery twenty-third day of September throughout the diocese; and that\nall priests, after the performing of this service, shall be suffered\npeaceably to return to their homes.\n\n\u2018Item, they ordain, that the bishop of Liege and his successors, and\nsuch as may have the government of the country in times of a vacancy\nin the see, and the members of the chapter of Liege, shall appoint\nsuch governor of the castle of Huy as they shall approve of: in which\ncastle, likewise, they shall not place a greater garrison, nor more\nstores of provision, than they shall judge expedient, like as an\nupright lord shall determine. They also insist on having a free ingress\nand regress into and from the town of Huy and the adjacent country.\nThey likewise ordain the same regulations respecting the castles of\nEscoquehen[15] and Bouillon, as to their governors, garrisons and\nstores.\n\n\u2018Item, the aforesaid dukes ordain, that should any one, however\nhigh his rank, attempt, by force, or otherwise, to deprive those of\nsuch gifts and preferments in the church, or any other offices for\nlife, as have been usually granted by the bishops of Liege and their\npredecessors, the members of the chapter of Liege shall be bound to\nrestore, and defend them in, their possessions to the utmost of their\npower, without any fraud whatever.\n\n\u2018Item, as there are still living many perverse conspirators, who are\nnow fugitives from the territories of Liege and county of Los, and\nhave retired into the neighbouring countries, where they have been\nreceived, the dukes aforesaid will appoint proper commissioners to\nmake inquiry whither such wicked persons have gone, and publish their\nnames. On the discovery of the places to which they have withdrawn,\napplications shall be made to the princes and lords thereof, that they\nmay be surrendered to the bishop of Liege, for him to inflict on them\nthe punishments due to their deserts, or at least that such princes\nand lords may drive them out of their respective countries. But should\nthese lords refuse to comply, or to do justice on such conspirators,\nthey shall be for ever banished from the bishoprick of Liege, the\ncounty of Los, and their dependancies, as conspirators and movers of\nsedition; and it shall be proclaimed throughout the above countries,\nthat no one receive them within their houses, but deliver them up\nto justice, should any attempt to return, demanding assistance from\ntheir lord, should there be a necessity for it. Should they be unable\nto arrest them, they shall denounce them to the nearest officers of\njustice, under pain of suffering corporal punishment, and having their\nfortunes confiscated, as would have been done to such conspirators\nand rebels. While exerting themselves in the performance of this\nduty, should they accidentally put to death any of such rebels, no\nconsequences shall ensue to their loss.\n\n\u2018Item, they ordain that the walls of the castle of Thuin, with its\ngates and towers, be razed, as well the part toward the town as that\ntoward the mountain, and the ditches filled up.\n\n\u2018Item, the same to be done to the town of Fosse and to the town\nand castle of Commun,--which towns shall not be repaired. And in\nlike manner shall all the posts on the river Sambre be destroyed,\nthe ditches filled, and neither they nor the towns shall be ever\nagain repaired, so that they may serve for places of defence to the\ninhabitants, on any pretence, in future times.\n\n\u2018Item, the gates, walls and towers of Dinant shall be pulled down, as\nwell on the opposite side of the Meuse as on this; and the inhabitants\nshall never rebuild them again.\n\n\u2018Item, the inhabitants of the said towns of Thuin, Fosse, Commun and\nDinant, or any persons from other towns, shall not rebuild or repair\nthe fortified places between or on the two rivers Sambre and Meuse, on\nthe road to Namur.\n\n\u2018Item, one of the gates of Tongres shall also be razed, namely, that\nwhich leads to Maestricht, with forty feet of wall on each side of the\nsaid gate, without a possibility of its ever being re-erected. The town\nof Tongres shall likewise, at its own expense, cause to be filled up\nthe trenches they had opened before the said town, when they besieged\ntheir lord within it, because they had put the country of Liege under\nheavy taxes, and had subjugated it.\n\n\u2018And whereas it is notorious, that very great losses have attended this\nsubjugation, the aforesaid dukes will, that an aid be levied on this\ncity, and the towns before mentioned, to the amount of two hundred and\ntwenty thousand golden crowns, which shall be raised as soon as may be,\nbeing levied in proportion to the comparative riches of each inhabitant.\n\n\u2018Item, in case any of the hostages shall die before all the articles\nof this treaty are completed, the aforesaid lords will, that the town\nor district whence such hostage or hostages shall have been sent, do\ninstantly furnish others of the same rank and property as those who\nhave died.\n\n\u2018Item, they ordain, that when this treaty shall be properly engrossed,\nthe bishop of Liege, his chapter, and the principal inhabitants, shall\ncome to sign it, and engage, that should any articles of it be not\ncompleted according to the exact tenor of the terms, then for each\nomission or neglect the bishop, his successors, the chapter and chief\ntowns shall forfeit two hundred thousand golden crowns of the coin of\nthe king of France, or other florins of gold of France, of the value\nof the aforesaid crowns. That is to say, fifty thousand to the then\nemperor or king of the Romans; to the king of France fifty thousand;\nand to each of the said dukes the like sum;--the whole to be levied on\nthe lands and moveables of the said Liegeois, by seizure of their goods\nand bodies wherever they may be.\n\n\u2018They are likewise to signify their consent, that should obstacles be\nthrown in the way by any of the said towns to prevent the articles\nof the said treaty from being carried into effect, the bishop of\nLiege, and the archbishop of Cologne for the time being, shall be the\narbitrators between such towns,--and their decision shall be final.\n\n\u2018When a legal pope shall be elected, and his authority over the whole\nchurch of God be acknowledged, then such as make opposition to the\nexecution of the above treaty shall be laid under an interdict, which\nshall not be taken off, until sufficient reparation be made, and the\naforesaid pecuniary forfeitures be paid.\n\n\u2018Should any of the towns, or their inhabitants, offer any insult, in\ncontradiction to the above treaty, to either of the said dukes or\ntheir successors, the bishop of Liege, or his vicar in his absence,\nthe chapter and citizens shall be required to constrain the offenders\nto make full reparation within one month from the time of complaint\nbeing made. And should such reparation not be made within the month,\nas aforesaid, after the summons to that effect has been delivered, the\ncountry shall be liable to the same fines as before mentioned.\n\n\u2018The dukes of Burgundy and of Holland order, that all these articles be\nfairly engrossed, and then sealed with their seals, and then given to\nthe lord bishop of Liege, or to his chapter, with a copy for the city\nof Liege and one for each principal town. In return, the bishop and the\ntowns shall give to the dukes aforesaid letters signed with their great\nseals acknowledging the receipt of the above treaty, and promising\nobedience to all the articles of it, and binding themselves to the\nfines therein mentioned.\n\n\u2018As many noble persons and others, as well secular as ecclesiastic,\nhave presented many petitions to complain of the great losses they have\nsuffered during the late rebellion, and specifying their particular\ngrievances,--the dukes aforesaid, not having had time to examine them\nwith the attention they deserve, will have them examined with all\npossible speed, and will attend to each of them.\u2019\n\nThe whole of the above, having been written out fair, was, by the\ncommand of the two dukes aforesaid, publicly proclaimed in the great\nhall at Lille, and in their presence, the 24th day of October, in the\nyear 1408.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. IV.\n\n    THE KING OF FRANCE HOLDS A GRAND COUNCIL AT PARIS, TO CONSIDER\n    ON THE MANNER OF PROCEEDING AGAINST THE DUKE OF BURGUNDY FOR\n    THE MURDER OF THE DUKE OF ORLEANS.\n\n\nDuring the expedition of the duke of Burgundy against the Liegeois, a\ngreat many of the principal lords were, by the king\u2019s orders, assembled\nat Paris. Among them were, Louis king of Sicily, Charles king of\nNavarre, the duke of Brittany, the duke of Bourbon, and several others,\nthe greater part of whom were friendly to the duchess-dowager of\nOrleans and her children in their prosecution of the duke of Burgundy.\nMany councils were held as to the manner in which the king should\nproceed against the duke of Burgundy, who was the principal actor in\nthis murder, as has been before explained.\n\nIt was at length determined in these councils, that a most rigorous\nprosecution, in conformity to the laws, should be carried on against\nhim; and should he refuse to obey, the king, with all his subjects\nand vassals, should march, with as great a force as could be raised,\nagainst him, to bring him and his abettors to due obedience.\n\nAt the same time, at the solicitations of the duchess of Orleans\nand her children, the king annulled all his letters of pardon which\nhe had formerly granted to the duke of Burgundy, and declared them\nof no weight, in the presence of the queen, the duke of Acquitaine,\nthe princes of the blood, and the whole of the council. The duchess\ndemanded and obtained letters, confirming this renunciation of the\npardon; after which, she and her daughter-in-law, wife to the young\nduke of Orleans, left Paris, and returned to Blois.\n\nNot long after this, news came to Paris of the great victory which\nthe duke of Burgundy had gained over the Liegeois. This was confirmed\nby the return of the king\u2019s ambassadors, sir Guichard Daulphin and\nsir William de Tignonville, who, as has been related, were present at\nthe battle, and gave to the king and the lords then in Paris a most\ncircumstantial account of it. On hearing this, several who had been\nmost violent against the duke of Burgundy, now hung their heads, and\nbegan to be of a contrary opinion to what they had before held, fearing\nthe steadiness, boldness and power of the duke, who was said to have a\nmind equal to the support of any misfortunes that should happen to him,\nand which would encourage him to oppose and conquer all attempts of his\nadversaries. In short, all the measures that had been adopted against\nhim were dropped, and the men at arms were ordered to return to the\nplaces whence they had come.\n\nAmbassadors had arrived from England to treat of a peace, or a truce\nfor one year, between the kings of England and of France, which having\nobtained, they set out on their return, through Amiens and Boulogne,\nto Calais. On the road, they heard of the grand victory of the duke\nof Burgundy, which surprised them very much,--and they gave him the\nsurname of \u2018Jean sans peur.\u2019\n\nThe duke of Burgundy was very active in attaching to his party noblemen\nand warriors from all countries, to strengthen himself against his\nenemies, of whom he was given to understand that he had many. He\nheld on this subject several consultations with his two brothers and\nbrothers-in-law, namely, duke William of Holland and John of Bavaria,\nto which were admitted his most trusty friends; and they deliberated\nlong on the manner in which he should now carry himself. It was at\nlength finally concluded, that he should openly oppose all, excepting\nthe king of France and the duke of Acquitaine; and those present\npromised him aid and support with all the power of their vassals, on\nthese terms.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. V.\n\n    THE KING OF FRANCE IS CARRIED, BY THE PRINCES OF THE BLOOD,\n    TO TOURS IN TOURAINE.----PEACE IS MADE IN THE TOWN OF\n    CHARTRES.--THE DEATH OF THE DOWAGER DUCHESS OF ORLEANS.\n\n\nThe king of France left Paris, accompanied by the kings of Sicily and\nNavarre, the queen, the duke of Acquitaine, the dukes of Berry and\nBourbon, who, with others of the blood-royal, conducted him, under\nthe escort of a large body of men at arms, to Tours in Touraine, as\nhis place of residence,--to the great displeasure of the inhabitants\nof Paris, who were so much troubled thereat that they barricadoed the\nstreets with chains. They hastily sent to inform the duke of Burgundy,\nat Lille, of the king\u2019s departure, giving him to understand that the\ngreater part of those who had carried him away from Paris were not well\ninclined towards him.\n\nThis intelligence was not very agreeable to the duke, for he suspected\nthat the king had only been conducted to Tours that his enemies might\ncarry their measures against him more securely; for the lords who had\nthe government knew well that the Parisians loved the duke of Burgundy,\nand would not that any other should have the government of the kingdom,\nbelieving, from the hints he had thrown out, that when in power he\nwould abolish all gabelles and other taxes which oppressed the people.\n\nThe duke of Burgundy first consulted the dukes of Brabant and of\nHolland, and other steady friends, and then remanded his men at arms\nfrom Burgundy, who were on their march to their own country from Liege,\nand assembled another body from various parts. He advanced to Roye, in\nthe Vermandois, where he mustered his men, and then marched them toward\nParis. He quartered himself, on the 23d day of November, in the town of\nSt Denis, and his forces in the adjacent country. On the morrow, as he\nwas advancing with his men at arms in array toward Paris, two thousand\nor more combatants sallied out thence, and conducted him, with every\nmark of honour, to his h\u00f4tel of Artois.\n\nMany of the Parisians sung carols in the squares, although all\nrejoicings had been strictly forbidden on his arrival, to avoid\nincreasing the envy of the princes of the blood. Some of the king\u2019s\nservants said to those who were singing carols, \u2018You may otherwise\nshow your joy for his arrival, but you ought not thus to sing.\u2019\nNotwithstanding this, all the principal citizens, and those in\nauthority, showed him as much honour and respect as if he had been king\nhimself.\n\nA few days afterward, duke William, count of Hainault, arrived at\nParis, well accompanied by unarmed men, and, at the request of the\nduke of Burgundy, set out for Tours, attended by the lords de Croy,\nde St George, de la Viefville, d\u2019Olhaz, and others of the council of\nthe duke, to negotiate his peace with the king, and the lords who had\ncarried him from Paris. The count of Hainault was most honourably\nreceived at Tours by the king, the queen, and the other great lords;\nfor the marriage had taken place between John duke of Touraine, second\nson to the king, and the daughter of the duke of Burgundy: he was also\nnearly related to the queen.\n\nOn the conclusion of the feasts made on his arrival, the count of\nHainault and those who had accompanied him opened, in full council,\nthe business of their mission, namely, to make peace for the duke\nof Burgundy. After many discussions, it was resolved, that the king\nshould send certain persons, selected by him, to hold a conference with\nthe duke of Burgundy at Paris, and point out to him the means of his\nregaining the good graces of the king.\n\nDuke Louis of Bavaria, brother to the queen, Montagu grand master of\nthe king\u2019s household, and other experienced counsellors, were nominated\nfor this purpose; and they returned with the count de Hainault to\nParis, when what had passed was told to the duke of Burgundy.\n\nAs all the circumstances of this treaty were not agreeable to the duke,\nand as he had many suspicions respecting Montagu, he was not disposed\nto receive the negotiators in the way they were sent to him. He even\npersonally made many reproaches to Montagu, who bore them patiently,\nexcusing himself for any thing that had passed. The treaty, however,\nhaving been altered and corrected, was sent back to the king at Tours,\nand in the end agreed to in the manner you shall hear.\n\nWhile these negotiations were going forward, and before their\nconclusion, the duchess-dowager of Orleans, daughter to Galeazzo duke\nof Milan, died in the town of Blois, broken-hearted at not having been\nable to obtain justice from the king and council against the duke of\nBurgundy for the murder of her late lord and husband, Louis duke of\nOrleans. The duke of Burgundy was much rejoiced at this event, for the\nduchess had bitterly carried on her prosecution against him.\n\nHer heart was buried at Paris, near that of her husband, and her body\nin the church of the canons at Blois. After her death, Charles, her\neldest son, was duke of Orleans and of Valois, count of Blois and of\nBeaumont, lord of Coni and of Ast, with many other lordships:--Philip,\nthe second son, was count of Vertus,--and John, the youngest, was named\ncount of Angoul\u00eame. These three brothers, and one sister, thus became\norphans, but they had been very well educated; yet, by the deaths of\nthe duke and duchess of Orleans, they were much weakened in support\nand advice,--and several of the king\u2019s ministers were not so zealous\nto prosecute the duke of Burgundy as they had been. This was very\napparent in the negotiations which took place some little time after\nthe death of the duchess, between the duke of Burgundy and the children\nof Orleans; for although the treaty sent by the king was not wholly to\nthe liking of the duke, as has been said, yet it was so corrected that\nthe parties accepted of it, in the following terms:\n\nFirst, it was ordered by the king and his great council, that the duke\nof Burgundy should depart from Paris with his men at arms, and return\nto his own country, where he was to remain until a certain day, namely,\nthe first Wednesday in February, when he was to meet the king at the\ntown of Chartres, accompanied only by one hundred gentlemen at arms,\nand the children of Orleans with fifty. It was also ordered, that duke\nWilliam, count of Hainault, should have under his command four hundred\nof the king\u2019s men at arms, to preserve the peace. It was also ordered,\nthat the duke of Burgundy, when he appeared before the king, should be\nattended by one of his council, who should repeat the words he was to\nsay; and the duke, in confirmation of them, was to add, \u2018We will and\nagree that it should be thus.\u2019\n\nAfterward, according to the tenor of the treaty, the king was to say to\nthe duke of Burgundy, \u2018We will, that the count de Vertus, our nephew,\nhave one of your daughters in marriage.\u2019 The duke was by this treaty to\nassign over to his daughter three thousand livres parisis yearly, and\ngive her one hundred and fifty thousand golden francs.\n\nWhen this treaty had been concluded, duke William set out from Paris\nfor Hainault; and shortly after, the duke of Burgundy disbanded his men\nat arms, and left Paris to go to Lille, whither he had summoned the\nduke of Brabant his brother, duke William and the bishop of Liege, his\nbrothers-in-law, and many other great lords.\n\nAt this period, there was a great quarrel between the duke of Brabant\nand duke William. It was caused by the father of duke William having\nborrowed in former times from the late duchess of Brabant one hundred\nand fifty thousand florins to carry on a war against some of his\nrebellious subjects in Holland, which sum the duke of Brabant had\nclaimed as belonging to him. He had in consequence, by the advice\nof his Brabanters, taken possession of a castle called Heusden[16],\nsituated between Brabant and Holland.\n\nThe duke of Burgundy took great pains to make up the quarrel between\nthese two princes, that they might the more effectually assist him in\nhis plans, which were very extensive. After this business had been\nsettled, and the parties had separated, duke William assembled in\nHainault, according to the king of France\u2019s orders, four hundred men\nat arms and as many archers. The principal lords among them were, the\ncounts de Namur, de Conversant and de Salmes. The duke of Burgundy,\nconformably to the treaty, set out, the day after Ash-Wednesday,\nattended by his son-in-law the count de Penthievre[17], and lay at\nBapaume. Thence he went to Paris, with duke William, the above-named\nlords, the count de St Pol, the count de Vaudemont[18], and several\nothers of the nobility.\n\nOn Saturday, the 2d day of March, they arrived all together at the\ntown of Gallardon, four leagues distant from Chartres. The Wednesday\nfollowing, duke William of Holland advanced with his body of forces to\nChartres, where the king then was. On the ensuing Saturday, the duke\nof Burgundy set out from Gallardon, to wait on the king, escorted by\nsix hundred men at arms; but when he approached Chartres, he dismissed\nthem all, excepting one hundred light horsemen, in compliance with the\ntreaty, and thus entered Chartres about ten o\u2019clock in the morning,\nriding strait to the church as far as the cloisters of the canons,\nwhere he was lodged.\n\nAt this same time, the duke of Orleans, in company with his brother the\ncount de Vertus, and, according to the treaty, attended by only fifty\nmen at arms, entered the church of our Lady at Chartres, with the king\ntheir uncle, the queen, the duke of Acquitaine, and several princes of\nthe blood.\n\nThat the king and lords might not be pressed upon by the spectators,\nand that all might plainly see the ceremony, a scaffolding was erected\nin the church, on which the king was seated near the crucifix. Round\nhim were placed the queen, the dauphin and dauphiness, daughter to the\nduke of Burgundy, the kings of Sicily and Navarre, the dukes of Berry\nand Bourbon; the cardinal de Bar, the marquis du Pont his brother, the\narchbishop of Sens, and the bishop of Chartres, with other counts,\nprelates, and the family of Orleans were behind the king. At the\nentrance of the church, by the king\u2019s orders, were a body of men at\narms drawn up in battle-array.\n\nIt was not long before the duke of Burgundy entered the church, and on\nhis advancing toward the king, all the lords, excepting the king, queen\nand dauphin, rose up from their seats. The duke, on his approach to the\nking, kneeled down with his advocate the lord d\u2019Ollehaing, who repeated\nto the king the following words:\n\n\u2018Sire, behold here my lord of Burgundy, your subject and cousin, who\nis thus come before you, because he has heard you are angry with him,\nfor the action he has committed against the person of the late duke of\nOrleans your brother, for the good of yourself and your kingdom,--the\ntruth of which he is ready to declare and prove to you, whenever you\nshall please. My lord, therefore, entreats of you, in the most humble\nmanner possible, that you would be pleased to withdraw from him your\nanger, and restore him to your good graces.\u2019 When the lord d\u2019Ollehaing\nhad said this, the duke of Burgundy himself addressed the king, saying,\n\u2018Sire, I entreat this of you:\u2019--when instantly the duke of Berry,\nseeing the king made no reply, bade the duke of Burgundy retire some\npaces behind,--which being done, the duke of Berry, kneeling before\nthe king, said something to him in a low voice,--and immediately the\ndauphin, the kings of Sicily and Navarre, with the duke of Berry, knelt\ndown to the king, and said, \u2018Sire, we supplicate that you would be\npleased to listen to the prayer of your cousin the duke of Burgundy.\u2019\nThe king answered them, \u2018We will that it be so,--and we grant it from\nour love to you.\u2019\n\nThe duke of Burgundy then approached the king, who said to him,--\u2018Fair\ncousin, we grant your request, and pardon you fully for what you have\ndone.\u2019 After this, he advanced, with the lord d\u2019Ollehaing, toward the\nchildren of Orleans, who, as I have said, were behind the king weeping\nmuch.\n\nThe lord d\u2019Ollehaing addressed them, saying, \u2018My lords, behold the\nduke of Burgundy, who entreats of you to withdraw from your hearts\nwhatever hatred or revenge you may harbour within them, for the act\nperpetrated against the person of my lord of Orleans, your father, and\nthat henceforward ye may remain good friends.\u2019 The duke of Burgundy\nthen added, \u2018And I beg this of you.\u2019 No answer being made, the king\ncommanded them to accede to the request of his fair cousin the duke\nof Burgundy. Upon which they replied, \u2018Sire, since you are pleased to\ncommand us, we grant him his request, and shall extinguish all the\nhatred we bore him; for we should be sorry to disobey you in any thing\nthat may give you pleasure.\u2019\n\nThe cardinal de Bar then, by the king\u2019s orders, brought an open Bible,\non which the two parties, namely, the two sons of the late duke of\nOrleans and the duke of Burgundy swore on the holy evangelists,\ntouching them with their hands, that they would mutually preserve a\nfirm peace towards each other, without any open or secret attempts\ncontrary to the full meaning of their oaths. When this was done, the\nking said, \u2018We will that henceforth ye be good friends; and I most\nstrictly enjoin, that neither of you attempt any thing to the loss or\nhurt of the other, nor against any persons who are attached to you,\nor who may have given you advice or assistance; and that you show\nno hatred against any one on this occasion, under pain of offending\nagainst our royal authority,--excepting, however, those who actually\ncommitted this murder, who shall be for ever banished from our kingdom.\u2019\n\nAfter this speech of the king, these princes again swore they would\nfaithfully abide by their treaty. The duke of Burgundy then advanced\nto salute the wife of the dauphin, the duke of Acquitaine; and about\nan hour after this ceremony had taken place the duke took his leave\nof the king, queen, and the lords present, and set out from Chartres\nfor Gallardon, where he dined. Many who were there were very much\nrejoiced that matters had gone off so well; but others were displeased,\nand murmured, saying, that henceforward it would be no great offence\nto murder a prince of the blood, since those who had done so were so\neasily acquitted, without making any reparation, or even begging pardon.\n\nThe duke of Orleans and his brother shortly after took leave of the\nking, queen, dauphin, and the lords of the court, and returned, with\ntheir attendants, to Blois, whence they had come, not well satisfied,\nany more than their council, with the peace that had been made.\n\nThe marquis du Pont, son to the duke of Bar, and cousin to the duke of\nBurgundy, who before this day was not beloved by him, on account of\nthe murder of the duke of Orleans, followed him to Gallardon, where\nthey dined publicly together in great friendship and concord. About two\no\u2019clock in the afternoon duke William, the count de St Pol, and other\ngreat lords, visited the duke of Burgundy at his lodgings in Gallardon,\nand then returned together toward Paris.\n\nThe king, the queen, the dauphin, and the other kings, princes and\ncardinals, arrived at Paris on Mid-Lent Sunday; and the dukes of\nBurgundy and of Holland, with the cardinal de Bordeaux, who was at that\ntime in Paris, on his way to the council of Pisa, went out to meet\nthem, followed by upwards of two hundred thousand Parisians of both\nsexes, eager to receive the king, singing carols, as he entered the\ngates, and conducting him with great rejoicings to his palace.\n\nThey were very happy that the king was returned to Paris, and also that\na peace had been concluded respecting the death of the late duke of\nOrleans. They attributed the whole to the great mercy of God, who had\npermitted that such strong symptoms of a civil war should be so readily\nextinguished; but they did not foresee or consider the consequences\nthat ensued.\n\nThe greater part of the Parisians were obstinately attached to the\nduke of Burgundy, through the hope that by his means all the most\noppressive taxes would be abolished; but they did not see clearly all\nthe mischiefs that afterward befel the kingdom and themselves,--for in\na very short time, as you shall hear, a most cruel contention broke out\nbetween the families of Orleans and Burgundy.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. VI.\n\n    THE QUEEN OF SPAIN DIES DURING THE SITTING OF THE COUNCIL AT\n    PISA.--THE MARRIAGE OF THE KING OF DENMARK, NORWAY AND SWEDEN.\n\n\nIn this year died the queen of Spain[19], sister to Henry king of\nEngland, and mother to the young king of Spain and queen of Portugal.\nThe Spaniards after her death sent home all the english servants, male\nand female, belonging to the late queen, who returned to England in\nmuch grief and sorrow at heart.\n\nAt this same season, great numbers of prelates, archbishops, bishops\nand abbots, set out from various countries of Christendom to attend the\ncouncil at Pisa which was assembling to restore union to the church,\nwhich had for a long time suffered a schism, to the great displeasure\nof many princes and well-inclined persons.\n\nAbout this same period, Henry[20] king of Denmark, Norway and Sweden,\ntook to wife the daughter of Henry king of England. These kingdoms were\nput into the hands of the king of Denmark by their queen, who divested\nherself of all power and profit over them in favour of king Henry.\n\n\n\n\n[A. D. 1409.]\n\nCHAP. VII.\n\n    THE KING OF FRANCE HAS A SEVERE RETURN OF HIS DISORDER.--THE\n    MARRIAGE OF THE COUNT DE NEVERS WITH THE DAMSEL OF COUCY.--THE\n    WAR OF AM\u00c9 DE VIRY, A SAVOYARD, WITH THE DUKE OF BOURBON.\n\n\nAt the beginning of this year, Charles king of France was much\noppressed with his usual disorder. On this account, when the kings of\nNavarre and Sicily, and the duke of Berry, had properly provided, in\nconjunction with the duke of Burgundy, for the state of the king, and\nthe government of the realm, they went to visit their own territories.\nIn like manner, the duke of Burgundy, went to the marriage of his\nbrother Philip count of Nevers, who took to wife the damsel of Coucy,\ndaughter to sir Enguerrand de Coucy[21], formerly lord and count of\nSoissons, and niece by the mother\u2019s side to the duke of Lorraine and to\nthe count de Vaudemont; which marriage was celebrated in the town of\nSoissons.\n\nThis ceremony was performed on Saint George\u2019s day, and the feasts and\nentertainments lasted for three days afterward. There were present the\nduchess of Lorraine[22] and the countess of Vaudemont[23], who had come\nexpressly thither to do honour to the lady of Coucy and her daughter.\n\nWhen these feasts were over, the duke of Burgundy, attended by his\nson-in-law the count de Penthievre, set out for Burgundy; and shortly\nafter, the count de Nevers conducted his wife, and the duchess of\nLorraine and the countess of Vaudemont, to his county of Rethel, where\nshe was received with every token of joy.\n\nDuring this time, the duke of Bourbon was challenged by Am\u00e9 de Viry,\na Savoyard, and a poor blade in comparison with the duke of Bourbon;\nnevertheless, he committed much damage by fire and sword in the\ncountries of Bresse and Beaujolois. The duke was very indignant at\nthis, and assembled a large body of men at arms and archers to punish\nand conquer him. He ordered his son, the count de Clermont, to lead on\nthe van, and he speedily followed in person.\n\nIn his company were the counts de la Marche and de Vend\u00f4me, the lord\nd\u2019Albret, constable of France, Louis de Baviere, brother to the queen,\nMontagu, grand master of the king\u2019s household, the lord de la Heuse and\nmany more great lords, who advanced with a numerous body of men to the\ncounty of Beaujolois.\n\nAm\u00e9 de Viry was informed of the great force which the duke of Bourbon\nwas marching against him, and dared not wait his arrival; for he had\nnot strength enough to garrison the forts he had taken. On his retreat,\nhe marched to a town called Bourg-en-Bresse, which belonged to the earl\nof Savoy, his lord. The earl, however, would not support him against\nhis great uncle, the duke of Bourbon, but gave him up, on condition\nthat Am\u00e9 should make every amends in his power for the mischiefs he had\ndone, and should surrender himself to one of the prisons of the duke,\nuntil he should have completely made him satisfaction, but that no harm\nof any sort should be done to his person.\n\nThe duke of Bourbon gladly received him, and thanked his nephew for his\nfriendship.--This caused a quarrel of some standing to be made up; for\nthe earl of Savoy had declared his great uncle owed him homage for his\nlands of Beaujolois, which he would not pay,--but now the dispute was\nmutually referred by them to the duke of Berry.\n\nWhen these matters were concluded, the duke of Bourbon returned to\nFrance, and disbanded his forces. Some time after, by means which Viry\nmade use of with the duke, he obtained his liberty. Waleran count de\nSt Pol intended being of this expedition with the duke of Bourbon, and\nraised a large force; but on marching near Paris, he was ordered not to\nproceed further, and to return to the frontiers of the Boulonois, where\nhe had been specially commissioned by the king.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. VIII.\n\n    TWO COMBATS TAKE PLACE AT PARIS IN THE PRESENCE OF THE\n    KING.----THE DEATH OF THE ARCHBISHOP OF RHEIMS.----THE COUNCIL\n    AT PISA.\n\n\nAbout Ascension-day, the king of France, who had been grievously ill,\nwas restored to health,--and in consequence, the dukes of Berry,\nBurgundy, and Bourbon, with many other lords, instantly returned to\nParis. Two combats were ordained to be fought in the square behind St\nMartin des Champs, in the presence of the king and the aforesaid lords.\nOne was between a breton knight, called sir William Batailler, and an\nEnglishman, named sir John Carmien, for a breach of faith.\n\nWhen they were met, and Montjoye king at arms had proclaimed their\nchallenges and the causes of them, in the accustomed manner, he bade\nthem do their duty. Sir William, who was the appellant, issued first\nout of his pavilion, and marched proudly toward his adversary, who was\nadvancing to meet him. They threw their lances without effect, and\nthen made use of their swords: but in this last combat the Englishman\nwas slightly wounded below his armour, when the king instantly put an\nend to the fight. They were both very honourably led out of the lists,\nand conducted to their lodgings.\n\nThe other combat was between the seneschal of Hainault and sir John\nCornwall, an english knight of great renown, and who had married a\nsister to the king of England[24]. This combat was undertaken by the\ntwo knights at the desire of the duke of Burgundy, when at Lille, to\nshow their prowess in running a few courses with the lance and giving\nsome strokes with the battle-axe: but when the duke had caused the\nlists to be prepared, the two champions were ordered by the king to\nrepair to Paris, and to perform their deeds of arms in his presence.\n\nAccording to these orders, and on the appointed day, sir John Cornwall\nentered the lists first, very grandly equipped, and, galloping his\nhorse around, came before the king, whom he gallantly saluted. He was\nfollowed by six little pages mounted on as many war-horses, the two\nfirst of which were covered with furniture of ermines, and the other\nfour with cloth of gold. When he had made his obeisances, the pages\nretired without the lists.\n\nShortly after, the seneschal arrived, attended by the duke of Brabant\nand his brother, the count de Nevers, each holding a rein of his horse,\non his right and left. The count de Clermont bore his battle-axe, and\nthe count de Penthievre his lance. When he had made the circuit of the\nlists, and had saluted the king, as sir John Cornwall had done, they\nprepared to tilt with their lances; but as they were on the point of so\ndoing, the king caused it to be proclaimed that they should not proceed\nin this matter, which was very displeasing to both of them, and forced\nthem to return to their h\u00f4tels.\n\nIt was again proclaimed, by the king\u2019s orders, that this deed of arms\nshould not be carried further,--and that in future no one, under pain\nof capital punishment, should, throughout his realm, challenge another\nto a duel without a substantial cause.\n\nWhen the king had magnificently feasted these two knights, and shown\nthem much honour at his court, they departed, as it was said, for\nEngland, with the intention of completing their deed of arms.\n\nDuring this time, the cardinal de Bar, son to the duke of Bar, and\nGuye de Roye, archbishop of Rheims, in company with master Peter\nd\u2019Ailly, bishop of Cambray, and several other prelates and churchmen,\nwere journeying to the general council which was to be held at Pisa,\nand took up their lodgings one night at a town called Voltri, on the\nsea-coast, about four leagues from Genoa. At this place the blacksmith\nof the archbishop had a quarrel with a blacksmith of the town, about\nthe price of shoeing a horse, which proceeded from words to blows, and\nthe archbishop\u2019s blacksmith killed the other, and fled instantly for\nsafety to the lodgings of his master.\n\nThe townsmen immediately rose,--and a great number of them came to\nrevenge the death of their countryman. The archbishop, hearing of the\ncause of this tumult, left his chamber, and kindly addressed them,\npromising to have the injury immediately repaired, according to their\nwishes; and, the more to appease them, he delivered up his blacksmith\ninto the hands of the magistrate of the place, who was a lieutenant of\nBoucicaut marshal of France, then governor of Genoa.\n\nBut this was of no avail,--for as the archbishop was speaking to them,\nwithout the door of his house, one of the mob thrust his javelin right\nthrough his body to the heart, so that he dropped down dead without\nuttering another word. It was a great pity, for he was a religious\nprelate, and of a noble family.\n\nThis deed, however, did not satisfy them; for instantly after they\nmurdered the magistrate and the aforesaid blacksmith, and also\nendeavoured to force their way into the house, whither the cardinal de\nBar and the greater part of the others had retired, in order to put\nthem likewise to death.\n\nThey were, however, at length appeased by the principal inhabitants,\nand it was concluded that the cardinal should grant them his pardon for\nwhat they had done against him,--to which, indeed, he was induced by\nhis attendants, from their fears of being all destroyed.\n\nThey never told him of the murder of the archbishop until he was gone\ntwo leagues from the town: on the hearing of it, he was so troubled,\nand sick at heart, that he was near falling off his mule. His\nattendants, notwithstanding, made him hasten his pace as much as they\ncould; for they were alarmed for their lives, after the instances they\nhad seen, and from the numbers of people they perceived descending\nthe hills, and the accustomed signs they saw when a town is under any\napprehension of danger, and the ringing of bells in the manner usual on\nthese occasions.\n\nThese signals were sounded throughout the country, and the peasants\nwere seen running down the hills to overtake them; but when they were\narrived within a league of Genoa, the marshal Boucicaut[25] came out\nwith a handsome company to meet him. The cardinal made loud complaints\nto him of the outrages that had been committed on his people at the\ntown of Voltri, and demanded that he would judicially inquire into it.\nThe marshal replied, that he would make so severe an example of that\ntown that all others should take warning from it.\n\nThe cardinal was then conducted into the city of Genoa, where he was\nmade welcome by the churchmen and other inhabitants; and this same\nday the body of the archbishop of Rheims was brought thither, and\nhonourably interred,--and his obsequies were performed in the principal\nchurch of Genoa.\n\nShortly after, the marshal Boucicaut punished most severely all whom\nhe could apprehend that had committed these outrages, with their\naccomplices: they were put to death in various ways, and their houses\nalso were razed to the ground, that these executions might serve for\nwarnings to others never to commit such cruel murders.\n\nThe cardinal de Bar, with his companions, now set out from Genoa, and\ntravelled, by easy day\u2019s journies, to Pisa, where were assembled a\nprodigious number of cardinals, doctors in theology, and graduates in\ncivil law and other sciences, ambassadors and prelates, in obedience\nto the two popes, from different kingdoms, and from all parts of\nChristendom.\n\nAfter many councils had been held on the schism in the church, they\ncame at last to this conclusion: they unanimously condemned the\ntwo rival popes as heretics, schismatics, obstinate in evil, and\nperturbators of the peace of our holy mother the church. This sentence\nwas passed in the presence of twenty-four cardinals, at the gates\nof Pisa, before all the people, the 15th day of June, in the year\naforesaid.\n\nThe same cardinals, after invoking the grace and assistance of the\nholy Spirit, entered into conclave, where they remained until the 16th\nday of the same month, when they finished their election. They chose\nPeter of Candia, so named from being a native of that island: he was\nof the order of Friars Minors, created a doctor in theology at Paris,\narchbishop of Milan and cardinal; and, when consecrated sovereign of\nthe true and holy catholic church, he took the name of Pope Alexander V.\n\nO, most powerful God! how great was the joy thus caused, through thy\nnever-failing grace; for it is impossible to relate the shoutings and\nacclamations that resounded for more than a league round the city of\nPisa. But what shall we say of the city of Paris? Why, when this joyful\nnews was brought thither, on the 8th of July, they incessantly shouted,\nnight and day, \u2018Long live Alexander V. our pope!\u2019 in all the squares\nand streets, and entertained all passengers with meat and drink, from\ntheir heartfelt happiness. When the ceremony of consecrating the pope\nwas over, letters were sent to different persons, the more fully to\nexplain the proceedings of the council. I shall insert the one written\nby the abbot of Saint Maixence to the bishop of Poitiers, the tenor of\nwhich was as follows.\n\n\u2018Reverend father, and my redoubted lord, after my humble respects being\naccepted, I know that your reverence would gladly be informed of the\nproceedings of the council, which has been held in the city of Pisa,\nand any intelligence concerning it; and it is for this reason I have\nindited the following lines to your reverence.\n\n\u2018First, then, on the 25th day of March all the cardinals, who had been\ncreated by both popes, and all the prelates then in Pisa, assembled\nin the church of St Martin, which is situated beyond the river, on the\nroad leading to Florence, and thence being dressed in their robes, with\nmitres on their heads, they made a grand procession to the cathedral\nchurch, which is as distant from that of Saint Martin as our church of\nN\u00f4tre Dame at Paris is from that of St Martin des Champs. There the\ncouncil always afterward assembled; and on this first day, mass was\ncelebrated with great solemnity: the sermon was preached by my lord\ncardinal of Milan, of the order of Friars Minors, a great theologian.\nWhen the service was over, the morrow was fixed on to open the council,\nand the two popes were summoned to attend on that day at the gates of\nthe church by two cardinals; but neither of them appeared, nor any one\nfor them.\n\n\u2018The council continued to sit till the latter end of March, when the\npopes were again summoned to appear, but neither of them obeyed. The\ncouncil therefore having required the two rival popes to come before\nthem, on account of the schism that has reigned in the church, and\nneither of them appearing, or sending any one to make satisfactory\nanswers for them, and the term allotted for their appearing being\nelapsed, declared them both guilty of the schism that distresses the\nchurch, and of contumacy, by their conduct, toward the council.\n\n\u2018The council ordered prosecutions to be carried on against both of the\npopes, on the Monday after Quasimodo-Sunday, the 15th of April, when\nmy lords cardinals celebrated together the service of the holy week.\nOn Good Friday, my lord cardinal d\u2019Orsini celebrated divine service in\nSaint Martin\u2019s church; and a secular doctor of divinity, from Bologna\nla Grassa, preached an excellent sermon.\n\n\u2018My lords cardinals were all present at the ceremonies of Easter\nSunday. During the ensuing week they assembled in council, sometimes\nalone, at others they called in the prelates, to deliberate on the\nstate of affairs, and what line of conduct should be pursued; and every\nthing was carried on with mutual good will on all sides. This week the\nambassadors from the king of the Romans arrived at Pisa.\n\n\u2018On the Sunday of Quasimodo, an italian bishop said mass before the\ncardinals; and a cordelier from Languedoc, a doctor in divinity\npreached the sermon, in which he greatly praised my lords cardinals\nfrom France, and such as were seeking to restore peace to the\nchurch,--but very harshly treated the two contending popes, calling\nthem schismatics, heretics, and traitorous enemies to God and to his\nchurch. He chose for his text, \u2018Jesus dixit, Pax vobis,\u2019 which he\nhandled extraordinarily well.\n\n\u2018The following Monday, the cardinals, prelates, ambassadors, and\nprocurators then present, made oath to obey the decisions of the\ncouncil. Mass was then chaunted, and succeeded by many prayers; then\nthe litany was sung, at which all the cardinals and prelates, dressed\nin their robes and mitres, attended, and so continued as long as the\nsittings of the council lasted, which made it a handsome sight to see.\n\n\u2018This same day, the council gave audience to the ambassadors from\nRobert king of the Romans; and the bishop of Verdun, on the part of\nRobert, who favoured pope Gregory as much as he could, began his\nharangue, taking for his theme, \u2018Pax vobis.\u2019 He made many mischievous\npropositions, to divide and distract the council, in obedience to\nhis master, and to serve the false pope Gregory. There were with\nthis bishop an archbishop of a foreign order, and a numerous body of\nattendants. When the bishop had made his propositions, the ambassadors\nwere required to deliver the same in writing, and to show their\nprocurations from their lord. A day was then fixed to hear the answer\nof the council to their propositions; but before this day arrived, the\nambassadors went away without taking leave of their host.\n\n\u2018This week of Quasimodo, the lord Malatesta came to Pisa in great\nstate: he had given to pope Gregory one of his castles called\nRimini[26], and made the following request to the cardinals assembled,\nas well on the part of pope Gregory as on his own,--namely, that it\nwould please the members of the council to adjourn its sittings, and\nchange the place of its meeting; that if they would so do, pope Gregory\nwould attend personally, provided the situation were in a place of\nsafety, and that he might have security for his coming to and going\nfrom it.\n\n\u2018In consequence of this request, the cardinals summoned the prelates to\nnotify it to them; but they unanimously declared, they would neither\nconsent that the place of holding the council should be changed nor\nthat the meetings of it should be adjourned. This answer was very\nagreeable to the cardinals. The lord Malatesta, therefore, returned\nwithout having succeeded in his object; but his anger was appeased by\nsome of the cardinals, his friends and acquaintance.\n\n\u2018From the 15th of April, the council continued sitting to the 23d\nof the said month,--when, after the solemnity of the mass, the\nadvocate-fiscal demanded, that the council should declare, that the\nconjunction of the two colleges of cardinals of the holy church of Rome\nhad been, and was, lawful and canonical at the time it was formed.\n\n\u2018Item, that it should declare, that this holy council is duly\ncanonical, by the cardinals of both colleges assembling for so\nexcellent a purpose.\n\n\u2018Item, that this holy council has been called together by the cardinals\nof both colleges with a good intent.\n\n\u2018Item, that it has been assembled at a convenient opportunity.\n\n\u2018Item, that it should declare, that this holy council, as representing\nthe universal church of God, has a right to take cognizance of the\nmerits of the two competitors for the papacy.\n\n\u2018Item, that a narrative should this day be read of the introduction and\ncommencement of the schism that took place from the time of the death\nof pope Gregory X. until the convention of this holy general council.\n\n\u2018In this narrative were displayed all the tricks and deceits that had\nbeen made use of, either individually or conjunctively by the two rival\npopes.\n\n\u2018After it had been read, the advocate fiscal drew several conclusions\nagainst the said rivals and their pretensions to the papacy, and ended\nhis harangue by demanding that they should be deposed and punished\ncorporally, and that the council should proceed to the election of a\ntrue and holy pope.\n\n\u2018The sittings were prolonged to Saturday the 27th day of the same\nmonth, when the ambassadors from the king of England entered the\ncouncil with a most magnificent state.--The bishop of Salisbury[27],\nin the diocese of Canterbury, made a handsome speech, urging the\nnecessity of peace and union in the church.\n\n\u2018When he had finished, the advocate-fiscal made an interesting oration,\nand concluded by demanding, through the procurator of the holy council,\nthat it would please to appoint a commission of certain wise, discreet,\nand experienced persons to examine witnesses as to the notorious sins\ncharged on the two competitors for the papacy, and his request was\ngranted.\n\n\u2018The second Sunday after Easter, mass was celebrated before the\ncardinals, and the sermon was preached by the bishop of Digne in\nProvence: he was of the order of Friars Minors, a learned doctor in\ndivinity, and had ever been a great friend to Pietro della Luna, and\nwas well acquainted with the tricks and cavils of both popes. This\nbishop delivered a good sermon from his text of \u2018Mercenarius fugit,\u2019 in\nwhich he discovered many deceptions of the two rivals, in descanting on\nthe words of his text.\n\n\u2018The sittings were continued from this Sunday to the 2d day of May,\nwhen mass was said before the cardinals; and the sermon was preached\nby the cardinal Prenestin, more commonly called the cardinal of\nPoitiers.--He delivered a good discourse, and chose for his text,\n\u2018Libera Deus Israel ex omnibus tribulationibus suis.\u2019 He urged in his\nsermon eleven conclusive arguments against the two popes, for refusing\nto give peace to the church, and ended by requiring the council, in\nconsideration of their obstinate contumacy, to proceed against them and\nprovide a pastor for the flock of God.\n\n\u2018On the 2d day of May, there was a general meeting of the council,\nwhen, after the usual solemnities, a very renowned doctor of Bologna\nmade a reply to the insidious propositions of the bishop of Verdun, on\nthe part of the emperor Robert. He condemned, by arguments drawn from\ndivine, canon, and civil law, all that had been advanced by the bishop;\nand his reasoning was so just and clear that the council were much\nsatisfied and comforted.\n\n\u2018The ensuing Sunday, mass was said before the cardinals, and the sermon\nwas preached by the general of the order of Augustins. He was a great\ndoctor in divinity, and a native of Italy. He chose for his text, \u2018Cum\nvenerit ille arguet mundum de peccato, et de justitia, et de judicio.\u2019\nHe discussed this subject very well, and with a good intent.\n\n\u2018The sittings were prolonged from this 2d of May to the 10th.--The\npatriarch of Alexandria celebrated mass before the cardinals on the\nfeast of the revelation of St Michael, the 8th of May; and he likewise\npreached a sermon, taking for his text, \u2018Congregata est ecclesia ex\nfiliis Israel et omnes qui fugiebant a malis additi sunt, et facti\nsunt illis ad firmamentum.\u2019 These words are written in the 2nd and 5th\nchapters of the first book of Machabees. In the course of this sermon,\nhe pressed six arguments against the two rival popes.\n\n\u2018On Friday, the 10th of May, the council, after the usual solemnities,\nresumed its sittings, when the advocate-fiscal made the following\nrequisitions: that the holy council would be pleased to confirm and\napprove the demands he had before made, namely, that it should declare\nthat the union of the two colleges of cardinals has been and is legal;\nand that the council should pronounce definitively on the other demands\nhe had made. The procurator fiscal made a request to the council, that\neight days should be allowed for the production of witnesses; and the\ncouncil was adjourned to the 16th of May.\n\n\u2018On the Sunday preceding that day, mass was said before the cardinals\nby the bishop of Faenza; and the sermon preached by a native of\nArragon, a learned doctor in divinity, who had always been of the party\nof Pietro della Luna. He chose his text from one of St Paul\u2019s epistles,\n\u2018Expurgate vetus fermentum ut sitis nova conspersio.\u2019 He expatiated on\nthis with such ability that all the doctors wondered. Drawing from it\ncertain conclusions, he said that the two rivals were as much popes\nas his old shoes, calling them worse than Annas and Caiaphas, and\ncomparing them to the devils in hell.\n\n\u2018Such things passed in the council to the 23d day of this present\nmonth, as I have briefly related, on which day the ambassadors from the\nking of Spain were to come to Pisa. The number of prelates that were\npresent cannot be estimated, for they were daily increased by new ones,\nwho came from all parts of Christendom. I should suppose that at the\nlast sitting of the council there were present of cardinals, bishops,\narchbishops, and abbots, wearing mitres, one hundred and forty, without\ncounting the non-mitred members.\n\n\u2018There were also ambassadors from the kings of France, England,\nJerusalem, Sicily, Cyprus, and Poland; from the dukes of Brabant,\nAustria, Stephen of Bavaria, William of Bavaria; from the counts of\nCleves and of Brandac[28]; from the marquis of Brandenbourg and de\nMoraine[29]; from the archbishops of Cologne, Mentz and Saltzbourg, and\nfrom the bishop of Maestricht; from the grand master of the Teutonic\norder; from the patriarch of Aquileia, and from many princes in Italy.\nNumbers of doctors in divinity, and in the canon and civil law, were\npresent, as well from France as from other countries, and very many\nprocurators from divers parts of the world, who, by the grace of God,\nhave held instructive and charitable conversations together from the\ncommencement of the council until this moment.\n\n\u2018In the city of Pisa are abundance of all sorts of provisions, which\nare sold at reasonable prices; but they would be much cheaper, were\nit not for the gabelles and taxes that are levied in these countries.\nIn my mind, Pisa is one of the handsomest cities existing: it has a\nnavigable river, within a league distant, running into the sea,--and\nwhich river brings large vessels, laden with different merchandise, to\nthe town. Around the city are vineyards of white grapes and many fine\nmeadows.\n\n\u2018We are very well lodged, considering the great number of men at\narms quartered in it for its guard. The town has been conquered by\nthe Florentines, who have banished many of the Pisans to prevent any\ntreasons, and sent them to Florence, to the amount of two thousand; and\nthey are obliged to show themselves twice every day to the governor at\nan appointed place, under pain of death.\n\n\u2018Four or five thousand of the Pisans went to ask succour from king\nLancelot[30], who, in compliance with their request, advanced within\nfive leagues of Pisa, with a force of twenty-three thousand combatants,\nas well horse as foot; but the Florentines, through the grace of God,\nare well able to resist all his power, and guard us. True it is, that\nthis king Lancelot ran a risk of losing his kingdom by the union of\nthe holy church, for he had tyrannically seized on a large part of the\npatrimony of St Peter.\n\n\u2018It was said that there were certain ambassadors from Pietro della Luna\nat the council, not with the intent of forwarding the union, but of\nthrowing every obstacle in its way.\n\n\u2018There were nineteen cardinals of both colleges, at this council\nat Pisa, including the cardinal de Challan, whose attendants were\narrived,--and the cardinal was to follow with the ambassadors from\nSavoy.\n\n\u2018My lords the cardinals are much displeased with those bishops,\nabbots, and chapters of cathedral churches, who have neglected to send\nprocurators to this general council. I have nothing more to send to\nyou at present.--Written at Pisa the 15th day of May, by your humble\nmonk and servant, the abbot of St Maxence.\u2019\n\nThe direction was, \u2018To the reverend father in JESUS CHRIST, and by the\ngrace of God, lord bishop of Poitiers, and chancellor to my lord the\nduke of Berry.\u2019\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. IX.\n\n    THE AMBASSADORS TO THE COUNCIL FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF PARIS\n    WRITE LETTERS, TO INFORM THOSE WHO HAD SENT THEM OF WHAT\n    HAD PASSED AT THIS COUNCIL.--PIETRO DELLA LUNA AND GREGORY\n    ARE DEPRIVED OF THE PAPACY, AND ALL PERSONS FORBIDDEN BY\n    THE HOLY COUNCIL FROM OBEYING EITHER IN ANY MANNER.--PETER\n    OF CANDIA, A CORDELIER, IS ELECTED BISHOP OF ROME BY THE\n    CARDINALS.--REGULATIONS FOR THE APPROBATION OF THE GENERAL\n    COUNCIL.\n\n\nI shall now transcribe the letters written by the ambassadors from the\nuniversity of Paris to the council at Pisa, the contents of which are\nas follows.\n\n\u2018Reverend fathers, lords and masters, after offering you our humble\nrecommendation, may it please you to know, that we write to inform you\nof the conclusions entered into by the council-general, which has held\nthirteen sittings.\n\n\u2018The two rival popes, having for some time been waited for in vain,\nnotwithstanding the summons sent them, have been declared contumacious\nin respect to schism and the faith. Many decrees were passed against\nthem for their contumacy, and commissioners were appointed to examine\nwitnesses against them.\n\n\u2018Item, the council-general approved of the union of the colleges of\ncardinals, the citations served on the contending popes, and the place\nof meeting of the council, as being perfectly convenient and secure.\nThe council declared, that it was supreme on earth to take cognizance\nand judge of the charges brought against the contenders for the papacy.\nIt was also declared by the council, that it had been lawful for any\none to quit his obedience to either of the popes, from the moment they\nhad promised to abdicate the papacy; and that all suits and processes,\ncarried on against such as had quitted their obedience to either, were\nannulled and of no weight.\n\n\u2018Public charges were then made against them, and an interlocutory\nsentence passed on the notorious sins of the two competitors. This\nday, doctor Peter Paoul declared, in full council, your opinions,\nand took for his text, \u2018Congregabuntur filii Jud\u00e6 et filii Israel et\nfacient sibimet caput unum.\u2019 That is to say, Those who are come to\nthis council, and such as shall hereafter come, will choose from among\nthemselves a head to the church. A little before this, doctor Dominic\nle Petit had made a solemn harangue before all the cardinals, taking\nfor his text, \u2018Principes populorum congregati sunt cum Deo Abraham.\u2019\nThe cardinals and prelates of the holy church are styled princes of\nthe people. On this day also, the theologians, to the number of six\nscore and three, delivered their opinions, and eighty of them are your\nfriends and supporters.\n\n\u2018Item, this day it has been ordered that the two rival popes be\nsummoned to appear at the doors of the church on Wednesday the 5th of\nJuly, to hear their definitive sentence.\n\n\u2018Gregory has sent a bull to the English to entreat they would be of his\nparty, with Robert king of the Romans, to change the place of holding\nthe council, and that they would please to be of his council; but\nhe labours in vain, for the English, Germans, Bohemians, Polanders,\nFrench, those from Cyprus, Rhodes and Italy, are all unanimous,\nexcepting Robert, whose ambassadors have gone away.\n\n\u2018Few prelates have come to this council from the kingdom of Hungary.\nKing Ladislaus wrote that he intended being here in person, but he is\nfully occupied in his war against the infidels.\n\n\u2018Pietro Mastin, called della Luna, has issued a most thundering bull,\nin which he admonishes the cardinals to return to their duty toward\nhim; and should they refuse, he prohibits them from attempting to\nmake another election, menacing them, in case of disobedience, with\nexcommunication and other penalties against them and their supporters.\n\n\u2018Reverend fathers, and redoubted masters, we have nothing more for the\npresent to write to you, except that all nations seem inclined to a\nreformation in the church, which the new pope, whom it shall please\nGod to elect, will be forced to comply with. Should you have any orders\nto send us, we are ready to obey them to the utmost of our power.\nBeseeching you humbly to keep all our concerns in your consideration,\nmay the Sovereign Lord have you under his guard!\n\n\u2018Written at Pisa the 29th day of May.\u2019 Underneath were signed the\nnames of Dominic le Petit, Pierre Paoul de Quesnoy, Jean Pere Ponce,\nVincent, Eustace de Faquemberge, Arnoul Vibrant, Jean Bourlet, dit\nFran\u00e7ois.--Master Pierre de Poingny and master Guillaume le Charpentier\ndid not sign the above, because they were absent.\n\nHere follows the sentence on the two contending popes.\n\n\u2018This present holy council, assembled in the name of JESUS CHRIST,\nwithdraws itself from the obedience to Pietro della Luna, called Pope\nBenedict XIII. and from Angelo Corrario, called Pope Gregory XII.; and\nthe holy council decrees and declares, that all true Catholics ought to\ndo the same.\n\n\u2018Item, the same holy synod, as representative and judge of the\nuniversal church, after mature consideration and examination of\nwitnesses concerning the horrible sins of the two contending popes,\npronounces, in the church of Pisa, this its definitive sentence, that\nboth popes be deprived of every honour and dignity, especially that of\nthe papacy. It also pronounces, that they be separated from the holy\nchurch, in conformity to the sacred canons, and by the above sentence,\nforbidding all persons to have the boldness ever to defend or obey\neither of them as pope.\n\n\u2018The council forbids any Christians from obeying or showing favour\nto either, notwithstanding any oath or promise they may have made or\nentered into, under pain of excommunication,--and decrees, that whoever\nshall disobey this sentence shall be delivered into the hands of\nsecular justice, and condemned as one who favours heretics, and that he\nshall be punished according to the divine commandments, and the decrees\nof the holy canons.\n\n\u2018The council also declares and pronounces, that all promotions of\ncardinals made by the two rival popes, namely, those made by Angelo\nCorrario since the 3d day of May, and by Pietra della Luna since the\n15th day of June, of the year 1408, have been and are of no effect,\nand are annulled by this definitive sentence. It also declares, that\nevery judgment given by the aforesaid competitors for the papacy, to\nthe prejudice of the holy church, against any kings, princes, lords,\npatriarchs, archbishops, bishops, prelates of the church, or other\nprivate persons, are of no effect; and the holy synod has ordained that\nproceedings to the contrary, and to the welfare of the holy church\nshall commence on the ensuing Monday, the 10th day of June.\u2019\n\nThe above sentences and declarations were passed in the general council\nof Pisa, the 5th day of June, in the year 1409.\n\nThe 26th day of June, in the year 1409, Peter of Candia, a Cordelier\nand native of Greece, doctor of divinity, and usually called the\nCardinal of Milan, was unanimously chosen pope by the cardinals at\nPisa, with the approbation of the general council, and called Alexander\nV. who, immediately after his election, published the following bull.\n\n\u2018Alexander, bishop and servant to the servants of God, to the bishop\nof Paris, health and apostolical benediction. Praise and glory be to\nthe God of heaven for having instilled into the minds of men a desire\nof peace on earth, and who, through his benign grace and mercy, has\nbrought about an union of his Christian people, hitherto long disturbed\nby a dangerous schism.\n\n\u2018Who is there among mankind that will not most heartily rejoice at\nthis happy event, on considering the perils souls must run when such\ndivisions take place in the holy church, and which have for so long a\ntime been encouraged by sacrilegious schismatics?\n\n\u2018Our blessed God, taking pity on his people, who had long suffered\nfrom this division, opened and illuminated the minds of the holy\ngeneral council, who have justly condemned the two popes, according\nto the sacred canons, as enemies to God and his holy church, by their\nenormous, horrible, and notorious sins.\n\n\u2018When our brethren, the venerable Cardinals of the holy roman church,\nof whom we were one, were desirous of finding a proper pastor for the\nChristian flock, after the usual ceremonies and solemnities, with the\nconsent of the council-general, they entered into conclave, where,\nafter long discussions, they unanimously selected our humble self, then\ncardinal-priest of the church of the Twelve Apostles, and chose us\nbishop of Rome. Although we knew our unworthiness of so great a charge,\nconsidering our weakness, yet, always confiding in the aid of God, we\nhave accepted of it.\n\n\u2018Venerable brother, these things we notify to thee, as one loving and\ndesirous of the peace of the church, as we have been well informed;\nand we exhort thee and thy flock to render thanks to the all-powerful\nGod for this most gracious gift which he has granted to us. We have so\ngreat an affection for thy worthy person, that we inform thee, that we\nare ready to serve thee and thine to the utmost of our power.--This\npresent letter we have intrusted to be delivered to thee by our\nwell-beloved son, that notable man Paulin d\u2019Arc\u00e9, esquire of honour,\nchamberlain, and our loyal servant.--Given at Pisa the 8th day of July,\nin the first year of our papacy.\u2019\n\nIt is the good pleasure of our very sacred lord Alexander V. by divine\nProvidence, pope, that all promotions, translations, confirmations and\ncollations whatever, and all consecrations of bishops and others, that\nhave been granted or performed by the two competitors for the papacy,\nshall be considered as strictly legal, provided they were effected\nprior to passing of the definitive sentence, and done according to the\nregulations of the canon law.\n\nItem, it is also the pleasure of the general council, that our\naforesaid lord shall give his orders concerning the archbishop of Genoa.\n\nItem, the benefices in the church, that had been given by ordinary\njudges, have the approbation of the holy council to continue to them to\nwhom they have been given.\n\nItem, the holy council approves of proceedings being instituted against\nall who shall obstinately obey or favour either of the late competitors\nfor the papacy, Pietro della Luna or Angelo Corrario,--and the council\ncondemns such, as guilty of schism and notorious heresy, and ordains\nthat they be punished according to the regulations of the sacred canons.\n\nItem, it is ordered, that should the cardinal de Flisque[31] be willing\nto return to his duty, and appear personally within two months, he\nshall be kindly received, and enjoy all his honours and benefices,\nwhich he obtained in the year 1408.\n\nItem, all dispensations given by bishops of dioceses in those parts\nnot obedient to the two competitors, in the cases of persons not being\nof sufficient age to obtain dignities in the church or benefices,--and\nall absolutions, and acts of penitence, ordained by the competitors\nduring the schism, shall be reserved to the determination of the holy\napostolic see. All of which has been approved of and certified by the\nholy council.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. X.\n\n    THE DEATH OF THE BISHOP OF PARIS.----THE MARRIAGES, OF THE\n    DUKE OF BRABANT WITH THE NIECE OF THE KING OF BOHEMIA,--OF THE\n    CONSTABLE OF FRANCE\u2019S DAUGHTER WITH THE SON OF MONTAGU, GRAND\n    MASTER OF THE HOUSEHOLD,--OF THE KING OF CYPRUS WITH CHARLOTTE\n    DE BOURBON.\n\n\nIn these days, the lord John d\u2019Orgemont, bishop of Paris, departed this\nlife, in his episcopal palace, about the end of June. He was succeeded\nin his bishoprick by the lord Gerard de Montagu, bishop of Poitiers,\nchancellor to the duke of Berry, and brother to the grand master of\nthe king\u2019s household and to the archbishop of Sens. He was honourably\nreceived in the cathedral church of N\u00f4tre Dame in Paris, the 22d day of\nSeptember following.\n\nThe king of France, the dukes of Berry, Burgundy, and Bourbon, the king\nof Navarre, and several other princes, with prelates and churchmen\nwithout number, were present at his consecration. With the aid of the\ngrand master, his brother, the feast he gave on the occasion was the\nmost magnificent ever seen, in regard to the quantity of gold and\nsilver plate, and the diversity and abundance of meats and liquors.\nFrom this grand display, the princes observed that the grand master\ngoverned the king as he pleased; and they began to form suspicions as\nto the uprightness of his conduct.\n\nOn the 16th day of July following, duke Anthony of Brabant married, at\nBrussels, the niece of the king of Bohemia[32], heiress to the duchy\nof Luxembourg in right of her father. This marriage had been concluded\nby the mediation of the bishop of Ch\u00e2lons and sir Regnier Pot.\n\nSeveral knights, esquires, ladies and damsels of high rank, had\naccompanied the lady to Brussels, according to the orders of the king\nof Bohemia, her uncle. There were present at these nuptials the two\nbrothers of the duke of Brabant, the duke of Burgundy and the count de\nNevers, with their sister, wife to duke William count de Hainault; the\ncount de Charolois and the countess of Cleves, children to the duke of\nBurgundy; the marquis du Pont, his brother John[33] and their sister,\nthe countess de St Pol[34], all three children to the duke de Bar; the\ncounts de Namur and de Conversant, with their ladies, with many more of\nthe great nobility of both sexes.\n\nThe count de Clermont, son to the duke de Bourbon, was also there,--and\nwhen he tilted was attended by the duke of Burgundy and count de\nNevers. The duke bore his shield and the count his lance, to the\nsurprise of many present, on account of the great hatred that had so\nlately subsisted between them for the murder of the duke of Orleans:\nhowever, they seemed then to be in perfect concord. This feast was\nabundantly served with all sorts of provisions and wines,--and when it\nwas ended, the different guests retired to their respective countries.\n\nOn the last day but one of the same month of July, the marriage of the\ndaughter of the lord d\u2019Albret, constable of France, with the eldest\nson of Montagu[35], grand master of the king\u2019s household, was solemnly\ncelebrated. The queen of France and numbers of the great nobles were\npresent,--and the whole of the expense was paid by the king, which\ncreated much anger and envy in several of the princes of the blood\nagainst Montagu.\n\nAt this time, the truces were broken between the kings of France and of\nEngland, but only at sea; and a bitter naval war ensued, to the great\nloss of many merchants in each country.\n\nOn the 2d day of August, John de Lusignan, king of Cyprus, espoused by\nproxy, Charlotte de Bourbon, sister-german to the count de la Marche.\nThe ceremony was performed in the castle of Melun, in the presence of\nthe queen of France, the duke of Acquitaine and her other children,\nthe king of Navarre, the dukes of Berry and of Bourbon, the counts de\nla Marche and de Clermont, the lord Louis de Baviere, brother to the\nqueen, and many ladies and damsels, who greatly amused themselves in\ntournaments, dances, in feastings and other pastimes.\n\nThe lady Charlotte, queen of Cyprus, was very handsome, and well\nendowed with noble and gracious manners. On the conclusion of these\nfeasts, she departed for Cyprus, most honourably accompanied by the\nnobles so ordered by her brother, and also by those who had been sent\nto her from the king of Cyprus. She landed at the port of Chermes,\nwhither the king came to meet her, much rejoiced at her safe arrival,\nand conducted her, attended by the greater part of the nobility of\nthe island, to Nicosia, where were made many feasts, according to the\ncustom of the country. They reigned for a long time with much honour,\nand had two children, of whom more shall be spoken hereafter.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XI.\n\n    THE DUKE OF BURGUNDY HOLDS A GREAT COUNCIL AT LILLE ON HIS\n    AFFAIRS.--THE DEATH OF THE DUCHESS OF ORLEANS.\n\n\nOn the 5th of August, and the eight succeeding days, duke John of\nBurgundy held a grand council in his town of Lille, on his own affairs,\nand on the means of reconciling his brother and brother-in-law, the\nduke of Brabant and duke William of Holland, who had quarrelled for a\ncause before mentioned.\n\nWith these two dukes, there were also present the duke of Burgundy\u2019s\nsister, the wife of duke William, the bishop of Liege, and the count\nde Namur. At length, the duke of Burgundy made peace between them, on\ncondition that duke William should pay to the duke of Brabant, for all\nhis demand of debt, the sum of seventy thousand golden florins of the\ncoin of France, by different instalments.\n\nWhen this had been settled, the duke of Burgundy went, about the\nmiddle of August, to Paris, by orders from the king and royal council:\nhe was accompanied by many men at arms, whom he quartered in the\nvillages round Paris. The reason why he was attended by such a force\nwas, because the duke of Brittany had lately brought from England\ngreat numbers of English, and, in conjunction with his Bretons, was\ncarrying on a sharp war against the old countess of Penthievre[36]\nand her lands. The queen of France and the king\u2019s ministers were much\ndispleased at this conduct of the duke of Brittany, because it was to\nthe prejudice of the realm. The duke had increased this displeasure\nagainst him by having beaten and ill treated his duchess, daughter to\nthe king of France, for blaming him on account of his undertaking this\nwar.\n\nIt was therefore intended, that the duke of Burgundy should march the\nforces he had brought, attended by other princes and captains, against\nthe duke of Brittany, to conquer his country and oblige him to submit\nto the king. The duke of Burgundy was very desirous of succouring\nthe countess and her fair son, the count de Penthievre; but while the\npreparations were making, the duke of Brittany, informed by some of\nhis friends that he was in the ill graces of his mother in law, the\nqueen of France, and of those who governed the king, sent, by advice\nof his council, certain ambassadors to Paris, to offer to submit his\ndifferences with the countess de Penthievre to the king and council,\nwhich was at length accepted, through the interference of the king of\nNavarre.\n\nThe countess de Penthievre and her son were summoned to Paris, whither\nalso came the duke of Brittany, when, after some discussions, peace was\nmade between them.\n\nIn this same month, Isabella, the king of France\u2019s eldest daughter, and\ndowager queen of England, but wife to Charles duke of Orleans, died\nin childbed. The duke bitterly lamented her loss, but received some\nconsolation out of regard to the daughter she had brought him.\n\nThe patriarch of Alexandria, bishop of Carcassonne, succeeded Guy de\nRoye (whose murder has been noticed) in the archbishoprick of Rheims,\nand the archbishop of Bourges succeeded to the patriarchate. Doctor\nWilliam Bouratier, secretary to the king, was nominated archbishop\nof Bourges; and nearly about this time died doctor Peter Paoul, and\nwas succeeded in his dignities by doctor Gilles des Champs, almoner\nto the king. Louis de Harcourt, brother to the count de Harcourt, was\nappointed archbishop of Rouen.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XII.\n\n    THE TOWN OF GENOA REBELS AGAINST BOUCICAUT, MARSHAL OF FRANCE,\n    THE GOVERNOR, WHILE OBEYING A SUMMONS FROM THE DUKE OF MILAN.\n\n\nBoucicaut, marshal of France, was at this time governor of Genoa, and\nresided there. He was called upon by the duke of Milan and his brother,\nthe count of Pavia[37], to settle a dispute which had arisen between\nthem, respecting part of their dominions. He accepted the invitation,\nthinking he should do an agreeable service to the duke of Milan, and\nnot suspecting any trick in the matter. But during his absence, the\ninhabitants of Genoa rebelled against his government, and sent for some\nof their allies and accomplices to come to them.\n\nThey cruelly murdered the marshal\u2019s lieutenant, the chevalier de\nColletrie, named Chollette, a native of Auvergne, which the other\nFrenchmen hearing of, fled into the forts, for fear of suffering a\nsimilar fate. These were instantly besieged by the Genoese, who sent\nfor the marquis of Montferrat[38]: he lost no time in hastening to\ntheir aid with four thousand combatants, as they had promised to pay\nhim ten thousand florins yearly,--and they immediately elected him doge\nof Genoa. They also chose twelve knights, as a council to manage public\naffairs.\n\nA few days after, Fassincault[39], a very renowned captain in Italy,\nand a great friend of the marquis of Montferrat, came to Genoa with\nthe intent of assisting the marquis; but the Genoese refused to admit\nhim, or accept of his offers. On his return, his force, amounting\nto eight thousand men, took a town called Noefville; but the French\nretreated within the castle, which was instantly besieged.\n\nWhen Boucicaut heard of the rebellion of the Genoese, he set out\naccompanied by his men, and the duke of Milan and the count of Pavia,\nand arrived with speed at the castle of Gaing[40], situated between the\ntown of Noefville[41] and Genoa, and fought with Fassincault and his\nforces. In this battle, eight hundred men were slain, the greater part\nbelonging to Fassincault,--and night alone separated the combatants.\n\nBoucicaut, by the advice of Enguerrand de Bournouville and Gaiffier\nde la Salle, both men at arms of acknowledged prowess, advanced that\nnight to the castle of Gaing, which he won, and amply provided it with\nprovision and all necessary stores. Fassincault remained in the town;\nbut seeing he could not gain the castle, he departed with his men to\nhis own fortresses.\n\nThe marshal Boucicaut carried on a severe warfare against the Genoese\nand those who had assisted them. He also sent messengers to inform\nthe king of France of his situation, and to require that he would\nimmediately send him reinforcements of men at arms.--The king and his\ngreat council, on receiving this intelligence and considering the\nfickleness of the Genoese, determined to proceed cautiously against\nthem. The king sent, at his expense, the lords de Torsy, de Rambures,\nand de Viefville, with a certain number of men at arms, to the city of\nAsti, belonging to the duke of Orleans, and near to the territory of\nGenoa, with the hope of affording assistance to Boucicaut.\n\nOn their arrival at Asti, they found that the whole country was in\nrebellion, excepting some forts, which held out for the French; but as\nthey were without the town, and could not contain many men, from dread\nof wanting provision, they were not of consequence, nor could they do\nmuch mischief. The above knights, therefore, perceiving they could not\nperform any essential services, resolved to return to France.\n\nAll merchants, and others who came from or had any connexions with\nGenoa, were now sought after in Paris, arrested and imprisoned, and\ntheir goods confiscated to the king\u2019s use. Now these Genoese had for a\nlong time been under obedience to the king, and had diligently served\nhim in many of his wars.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XIII.\n\n    THE PRINCES OF THE BLOOD ASSEMBLE, AND RESOLVE TO REFORM THE\n    MANAGEMENT OF THE ROYAL FINANCES.--THE DEATH OF MONTAGU.\n\n\nAt this period, the following princes of the blood,--Louis king of\nNavarre[42], the dukes of Berry, Burgundy, and Bourbon, and many other\ngreat lords, were at Paris; and having learnt that the king\u2019s treasury\nwas impoverished by his officers and those who governed him, insomuch\nthat his plate and the greater part of his jewels were in pawn, they\none day personally explained to the king, in the presence of the queen,\nthe duke of Acquitaine and others of his council, the miserable state\nof his finances, and the unworthy government of the officers of his\nhousehold. They at the same time requested, that he would be pleased\nto permit that some of them should have power to reform in general the\nabuses that had commenced with his reign, and to call to an account,\ndismiss, and punish all who should have mismanaged the finances,\naccording as the cases might require, without any exception whatever.\n\nThis request the king granted; and for the better carrying on their\nobject, the greater part of the lords before mentioned left their\nown h\u00f4tels, and resided in the king\u2019s palace of St Pol, where, with\nthe advice of the members of the parliament and the university, they\ncontinued their reformations for many days.\n\nThey soon discovered that those who had managed the finances for the\nlast sixteen or twenty years had very dishonestly acquitted themselves,\nand had acquired for themselves and their friends immense fortunes,\nto the prejudice of the state. Montagu, who had been the principal\nminister of finance, was particularly the object they aimed at,--and\nthey ordered him, with several others, to be arrested and confined in\nthe prisons of the Ch\u00e2telet.\n\nSir Peter des Essars, provost of Paris, was directed to put this order\ninto execution, with his sergeants; and by the command of the duke of\nBurgundy, the lords de Heylly, de Robais, and sir Roland de Vequerque,\nwere appointed to assist the provost in this duty. Having assembled\ntogether, they, on a certain day, met Montagu, and with him the doctor,\nMartin Gouge, bishop of Chartres, both going to hear mass at the\nmonastery of St Victor.\n\nThe provost, attended by the above lords, on meeting them, laid his\nhands on both, saying, \u2018I lay hands on you by virtue of the royal\nauthority vested in me for this purpose.\u2019--Montagu, hearing these\nwords, was much astonished, and trembled greatly; but his courage soon\nreturned, and he replied to the provost, \u2018What! rascal, art thou daring\nenough to lay hands on me?\u2019 But the provost answered, \u2018Matters will\nnot turn out as you think,--for you must make reparation for the many\nand great mischiefs you have done.\u2019\n\nMontagu, unable to resist, was tightly bound by the provost, and\ncarried by him straight to the little Ch\u00e2telet. The bishop of Chartres\nwas arrested with him, as he had been president of one of the financial\ndepartments. Montagu was several times put to the torture, insomuch\nthat, suspecting his end was approaching, he asked his confessor what\nhe had best do: the confessor replied, \u2018I see no other remedy than your\nappealing from the jurisdiction of the provost of Paris.\u2019 This he did;\nand the provost waited on the lords who had commanded him to arrest\nMontagu, to inform them, that he had appealed against his jurisdiction.\nThe parliament was consequently convoked to examine into the matter;\nand the members of it declared the appeal of no effect. The lords,\ntherefore, seeing the cause had been judged, said to the provost, \u2018Go,\nwithout delay, accompanied by some of the populace well armed, take thy\nprisoner, and finish the matter by cutting off his head with an axe,\nand fix it on a lance in the market-place.\u2019\n\nAfter these words, the populace armed themselves, and, on the 17th\nof October, assembled in bodies in the place Maubert, and in other\nparts of the town. They carried Montagu to a scaffold erected in the\nmarket place, where, having made him strip to his shirt, they cut off\nhis head, and fixed it to the end of a pike, and hung his body by the\nshoulders to the highest gibbet at Montfaucon. This execution was\nchiefly owing, as it was said, to the duke of Burgundy\u2019s hatred to him,\nwho even sent for a very great number of the nobles of his countries of\nBurgundy, Flanders, and Artois, to be spectators of it.\n\nA little before this execution took place, the duke of Bourbon, and\nhis son the count de Clermont, left Paris, indignant at the arrest of\nMontagu. The duke of Orleans, his brothers, and all of their party,\nwere also very much displeased that he was put to death,--but they\ncould not help it, for at that time they were not listened to by the\nking\u2019s council.\n\nOn the morrow of this event, duke William count of Hainault arrived at\nParis, having been sent for by the duke of Burgundy. A large company of\nthe nobles went out of the town to meet him; and he was most graciously\nreceived by the king, the duke of Acquitaine and the other princes. On\nhis arrival, the h\u00f4tel that had belonged to Montagu was given to him,\nwith all its furniture, for it had been confiscated to the king\u2019s use;\nand duke William took instant possession.\n\nThe castle of Marcoussi, which had been built by Montagu, was seized\nby the king: it is situated seven leagues from Paris, on the road to\nChartres. Montagu was born in Paris, and had first been secretary\nto the king: he was the son of Gerard de Montagu, who had also been\nsecretary to Charles V. He was of noble birth by his mother\u2019s side, and\nhad three daughters, two of whom were married; the elder to John[43]\ncount de Roussy, the second to Peter de Craon, lord of Montbason;\nand the third was betrothed to John de Melun, son to the lord\nd\u2019Antoing[44], but the match was broken off: his son was married to the\ndaughter of the lord d\u2019Albret, constable of France and cousin to the\nking, as has been related.\n\nAfter this, the provost of Paris arrested many of the king\u2019s officers,\nparticularly those who had been concerned in the finances and in\nmatters of revenue. All the principals in the department of the\ngeneralities, the presidents and others of the chamber of accounts,\nPerrin Pillot, a merchant, with several others, were imprisoned in the\nLouvre and in other places of confinement.\n\nWhen the borgne de Foucal, equerry to the king, and keeper of that\ndepartment of the treasury called the Epargne, heard that the grand\nmaster of the household was arrested, he was greatly astonished and\ntroubled, and, instantly changing his dress, mounted a fleet horse, and\nsecretly left Paris. This caused him to be much suspected of improper\nconduct by the princes who were examining into these matters.\n\nAt this period, the archbishop of Sens, brother to the grand master,\nGuichart Daulphin, William de Tignonville, knights, and master Goutier\nCol, secretary to the king, were sent, by orders from the king, to meet\nthe english ambassadors at Amiens. The archbishop, hearing of the\narrest and imprisonment of his brother, took leave of his companions,\nand set out from Amiens: but as he was journeying toward Paris, he was\nmet by one of the king\u2019s ushers, who made him his prisoner; for he had\norders so to do from the king, and confine him at Amiens, should he\nchance to find him there.\n\nThe archbishop very prudently replied, that he was ready to follow him\nto prison or to death; but when they came to the river Oise, near the\npriory of St Leu de Cherens, he played the usher a trick. On leaving\nthe ferry boat with a few of his people, he mounted the fleetest of his\nhorses, and galloped off, leaving the usher on the other side waiting\nfor the return of the ferry-boat; but, thunderstruck at his being so\ncheated, he returned to Paris without his prisoner.\n\nThe lord de Tignonville, having been a member of the chamber of\naccounts, was, by command of the princes, arrested by the bailiff of\nAmiens, and confined in his prison. But after a short time, he, the\nbishop of Chartres, and the other prisoners at Paris, were suspended\nfrom their offices, and, having given bail, were permitted to go about\nParis, or wherever they pleased.\n\nThe princes, not being able to attend sufficiently to these matters\nof reform from their other occupations of greater weight, appointed\na commission to examine carefully into them, which commission was\ncomposed of the counts de la Marche, de Vend\u00f4me and de St Pol, with\nsome members of the parliament.\n\nThe men at arms that had been called together round Paris by the duke\nof Burgundy and others were disbanded; and each, as they returned to\nthe places whence they had come, devoured the substance of the poor\npeople, according to the custom of that time.\n\nSir Guichart Daulphin[45], before mentioned, was, by the princes,\nappointed grand master of the king\u2019s household in the room of the\nmurdered Montagu; for the king was then troubled with his usual\ndisorder.\n\nThe bishop of Paris now requested of the princes, that they would, in\ntheir mercy, permit him to have the body of his brother taken down from\nthe gibbet, and, with many tears and supplications, petitioned for\nleave to bury him. But neither of these requests was granted him by the\nprinces; on which the bishop, ashamed of the disgraceful death of one\nbrother and the flight of another, the archbishop of Sens, soon after\nquitted his see, and taking with him his sister-in-law, the widow of\nMontagu, and some of their children, for the duke of Berry had already\nappointed another chancellor, went to the estate of his sister-in-law\nin Savoy: she was the daughter of sir Stephen de la Grange, formerly\npresident of the parliament, and brother to the cardinal d\u2019Amiens.\n\nThe borgne de Foucal, not answering to the proclamations that were\nmade for his appearance, was banished the realm of France, by sound\nof trumpet in the four quarters of Paris. In like manner were the\narchbishop of Sens and many other fugitives banished the kingdom.\n\nThe king of Navarre, the dukes of Berry, Burgundy and Holland, with the\ncounts de Vend\u00f4me and de la Marche, and several great lords, waited on\nthe queen of France and the duke of Acquitaine, to make them acquainted\nwith the reasons for the executing Montagu, and what progress they had\nmade in the reformation of abuses, and the measures they had pursued\nagainst such as were criminal. The queen testified her satisfaction,\nand was contented that they should proceed as they had began. She was,\nhowever, far from being pleased with the duke of Burgundy, whom she\ndreaded, from the great power he was now possessed of, more than any of\nthe other princes, although he treated her respectfully in his speech.\n\nThe marriage of the lord Louis of Bavaria, brother to the queen, was\nagain talked of with the daughter of the king of Navarre; and he was\npresented with the castle of Marcoussi, with all its furniture and\nappurtenances, which had lately been confiscated to the king, by the\ndeath of Montagu, which was very agreeable to the queen.\n\nAfter these lords had for some days transacted business at Melun, where\nthe court was, they all returned to Paris, carrying with them master\nPeter Bosthet, president of the parliament, and some members of the\nchamber of accounts, and assembled daily to inquire after those persons\nwho had been in the receipt and expenditure of the public revenues.\n\nDuring this time, the king, who had been very ill, was restored\nto health, insomuch that on the 2d day of December, he rode from\nhis palace of St Pol, dressed in a hauberk under his robes, to the\ncathedral church of N\u00f4tre Dame, where he made his prayers, a page\ncarrying behind him a very handsome steel helmet and a moorish lance.\nHaving finished his prayers, he returned to his palace of Saint Pol.\n\nOn the morrow, he held a royal council in person, at which were present\nthe king of Navarre, the dukes of Berry, Burgundy, and of Bourbon,\nwhich last was lately returned to Paris. It was there resolved, that\nthe king should summon the following lords to attend him personally\nat the ensuing feast of Christmas, namely, the dukes of Orleans, of\nBrittany, of Brabant, of Bar, and of Lorraine: the counts of Savoy[46],\nof Alen\u00e7on, of Penthievre, of Namur, of Harcourt, of Armagnac[47],\nand in general all the great lords within his realm of France and\nDauphiny, with many prelates and other noblemen. After this summons of\nthe king, the duke of Burgundy gave orders for a large body of men at\narms to be collected in his countries of Flanders, Artois and Burgundy,\nfor the safety of his person.\n\nShortly after this council, duke William count of Hainault went to\nMelun, the residence of the queen of France, who was his near relation;\nand so managed that she, who could not bear the duke of Burgundy, and\nhad strongly supported the party adverse to him, namely, that of my\nlord the duke of Orleans, was reconciled to him.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XIV.\n\n    DUKE LOUIS OF BAVARIA ESPOUSES THE DAUGHTER OF THE KING OF\n    NAVARRE.--THE NAMES OF THE LORDS WHO CAME TO PARIS IN OBEDIENCE\n    TO THE KING\u2019S ORDERS.\n\n\nAbout this time, duke Louis of Bavaria was married at Melun to the\ndaughter of the king of Navarre, according to what has been before\nmentioned. She had previously married the eldest son of the king of\nArragon[48], who had lately been slain in a battle between him and the\nviscount de Narbonne and the Sardinians, which took place in Sardinia.\nThere was much feasting at this wedding, which was attended by many\nlords, ladies and damsels.\n\nAbout Christmas the greater part of those lords whom the king had\nsummoned, arrived at Paris: the duke of Orleans and his brothers,\nhowever, did not come. On the eve of Christmas-day, the king went to\nthe palace to hold his state, and remained there until St Thomas\u2019s day,\nwhere he celebrated most solemnly the feast of the nativity of our Lord.\n\nOn this day the following persons were seated at the king\u2019s table at\ndinner: on his right, doctor William Bouratier, archbishop of Bourges,\nwho had said the mass, next to him was the cardinal de Bar. The king\nwas seated at the middle of the table, very magnificently dressed in\nhis royal robes. On his left were the dukes of Berry and Burgundy. A\ngreat variety of ornamental plate was produced in gold and silver,\nwhich were wont to be served before the king on high feasts, but which\nhad not for some time been seen, because they had been pawned to\nMontagu, and had been found after his death in his castle of Marcoussi,\nand in other places where he had hidden them.\n\nBy orders from the princes of the blood they had been replaced, as\nusual, in the king\u2019s palace, which was a very agreeable sight to the\nnobles and people of Paris, from their regard to the honour of the\nking\u2019s person, and his royal state.\n\nA great many princes and others had obeyed the king\u2019s summons, and\nwere at this feast,--namely, the king of Navarre, the dukes of Berry,\nBurgundy, Bourbon, Brabant, duke William count of Hainault, the duke of\nLorraine, duke Louis of Bavaria, brother to the queen,--and nineteen\ncounts, namely, the count de Mortain, brother to the king of Navarre,\nthe count de Nevers, the count de Clermont, the marquis du Pont, son\nto the duke of Bar, the count de Vaudemont, the count d\u2019Alen\u00e7on, the\ncount de Vend\u00f4me, the count de Penthievre, the count de St Pol, the\ncount de Cleves, the count de Tancarville, the count d\u2019Angy[49], the\ncount de Namur, and several others, to the aforesaid amount. The number\nof knights who accompanied these princes was so great that, from the\nreport of the heralds, they were more than eighteen hundred knights,\nwithout including esquires.\n\nNevertheless, there were not in this noble company the duke of Orleans\nnor his brothers, nor the duke of Brittany, nor the lord d\u2019Albret,\nconstable of France, nor the counts de Foix, d\u2019Armagnac, and many other\npotent lords, although they had been summoned by the king in like\nmanner as the others.\n\nOn St Thomas\u2019s day, after the king had feasted his nobles in royal\nstate, the queen, by orders from the king, came from the castle of\nVincennes to Paris. All the princes, prelates, and great crowds of\npeople, went out to meet her and her son, the duke of Acquitaine, and\nconducted her to the palace, where they presented her to the king, in\nthe presence of all the before-mentioned lords. Her son had visited\nhis government, to be properly instructed in arms, and other necessary\nmatters, that he might be the better qualified to rule his kingdom when\nit should fall to him.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XV.\n\n    THE KING OF FRANCE KEEPS ROYAL STATE IN HIS PALACE, WHEREIN\n    SEVERAL OF THE GREAT LORDS BEFORE MENTIONED HOLD MANY COUNCILS\n    ON THE STATE OF THE NATION.\n\n\nIn consequence of several meetings having been held in the presence of\nthe king, queen, and duke of Acquitaine, the king ordered the great\nhall of the palace to be magnificently prepared for a royal sessions.\nThither were summoned all the principal noblemen, prelates and others,\nwhen the king appeared seated in his regal robes. On one side of him\nwere the king of Navarre and the cardinal de Bar, and on the other\nthe duke of Acquitaine, the duke of Berry, and all the other princes\nand nobles, each seated according to his rank: in like manner were\nthe prelates, knights, and clergy, and a multitude of others, seated\naccording to their respective situations in life.\n\nThen, by the king\u2019s commands, the count de Tancarville, an able and\neloquent man, harangued with a loud and clear voice, how Richard\nlate king of England, and son-in-law to the king, had been basely and\ntreacherously put to death, during the time of a truce, by Henry of\nLancaster, calling himself king of England, but then earl of Derby, in\nconjunction with his partisans, as might be fully proved by several of\nthe English, near relations of the deceased king Richard:--And also how\nthe young prince of Scotland, an ally to the king, when on his voyage\nto France, was taken by this same Henry, and detained his prisoner for\na long time; as were likewise many Scots, who were in the company of\nthe prince of Wales. Yvain Graindos[50], with several of his Welshmen,\nallies also to the king, notwithstanding the aforesaid truce, were by\nthe English harrassed with war. The eldest son likewise to the prince\nof Wales was made captive[51], carried to England, and imprisoned by\nHenry for a considerable time.\n\n\u2018In consequence of the facts above stated, the king thinks he may,\nwithout further consideration, lawfully wage war against the said\nHenry and his english subjects, without giving them any respite.\nNotwithstanding this,\u2019 continued the orator, \u2018the king is desirous that\nwhatever he may please to order should be for the common welfare of the\nstate; and for this purpose a royal sessions has been held, for every\none to consider these matters and what ought to be the line of conduct\nfor him to pursue,--and, having an opinion thereon, if they will inform\nthe king or his council thereof, the king will thank them and follow\nthat advice which shall seem to him the most advantageous for the\ngeneral good.\n\nUpon this, the eldest of the princes of the blood, namely, the king\u2019s\nuncle the duke of Berry, arose from his seat, and, advancing in front\nof the king\u2019s throne, fell on his knees, and, speaking for himself and\nthe other princes of the blood, declared they would relinquish, to the\nuse of the state, all taxes and impositions which they annually levied\non their lands,--and in like manner would they relinquish all the fees\nand perquisites of office which they were in the habit of receiving\nfrom their places under the king, and as the members of his council.\n\nThe king kindly listened to the duke\u2019s speech, and accepted his offers,\nand then commanded him to be reseated. The lord Tancarville continued\nhis harangue, saying, that the king, then present, revoked all pensions\nand grants which he had given, and thus publicly annulled them. In\nregard to the reformation and future management of the finances, the\nking declared his intention that such regulations as should be ordered\nby himself, and by the advice of the count de la Marche (who had now\nlost his wife, the daughter of the king of Navarre), his brother the\ncount de Vend\u00f4me, the count de Saint Pol, and the other commissioners\nfrom the parliament, should be fully executed without excepting any\nperson whatever; and that the reformations by them proposed should take\nplace, as well in the chambers of accounts as in the generalities and\nin the household of the king,--and that all receivers, comptrollers,\nand all persons any way interested in the management of the finances\nof the realm, whether bishops or archbishops, and of what rank soever,\nshould be subjected to them.\u2019 The orator continued,--\u2018That the king\nwilled and ordered, that during his absence, the queen should call\nto her assistance some of the princes of the royal blood, and should\ngovern the affairs of this kingdom according as she might judge most\nconducive to its welfare; and in case of the absence of the queen, the\nduke of Acquitaine, his son, then present, should govern the kingdom,\nwith the assistance of the dukes of Berry and Burgundy.\u2019\n\nWhen the lord de Tancarville had more fully enlarged on the above\nmatters, and concluded his speech, the king descended from his royal\nthrone, and, with a small company, entered his apartment to dinner; and\nthe whole assembly broke up, and departed to their h\u00f4tels.\n\nAfter the dinner, the queen set out with her attendants for the castle\nof Vincennes, as it was the eve of the feast of the Circumcision, but\nleft her son with the king. On the morrow, the feast-day, the duke of\nBurgundy (who had alone more princes, knights, and gentlemen attached\nto him than all the other princes together,) gave presents of jewels\nand rich gifts, of greater magnificence than any one, according to the\ncustom of that day. He made presents to all the knights and nobles of\nhis household, to the amount, as was estimated, of fifteen thousand\ngolden florins, of medals formed like to a mason\u2019s level, of gold and\nsilver gilt; and at the pointed ends of these levels was fastened a\nsmall gilt chain, with a plummet of gold, so that it might be used as a\nrule.\n\nItem, on Twelfth-day following, Louis king of Sicily, having been sent\nfor by the king, entered Paris. He came from the city of Pisa, whither\nhe had gone to visit pope Alexander V. and made his entry, attended by\nnumbers of the nobility and clergy, who had gone out to meet him.\n\nShortly after, the cardinal de Thurey came to Paris, as ambassador from\nthe pope to the king, who most honourably received him, as he likewise\ndid Philibert de Lignac, grand master of Rhodes, and chief of the order\nof St John of Jerusalem, who had come from England.\n\nThe king now disbanded all the troops he had collected, as did the duke\nof Burgundy, excepting about one hundred or six score gentlemen, whom\nhe retained, with those of his household, to guard his person: the\nothers returned to their homes.\n\nBefore the duke of Burgundy left Paris, the duke of Acquitaine, with\nthe consent of the king and queen, was intrusted to his care and\nguardianship, that he might be properly instructed in the arts of war\nand government. He had been very anxious to obtain this, and had caused\nseveral of the princes of the blood to press the matter: even his\nuncle, the duke of Berry, had, on this account, more than once refused\nthe queen to accept of the guardianship of the duke of Acquitaine;\nbut had so urged the business that the lord de Dolhaing[52], knight,\nhis principal esquire, counsellor and advocate, had, by the earnest\ndesire of the queen, been made chancellor to the duke of Acquitaine,\nand the lord de Saint George his first chamberlain. The government\nof the castles of Crotoy and Beaurain-sur-Canche were granted to the\nduke of Berry for his life, on giving the preceding governors the\nusual pension, in whose room he appointed two of his own knights; the\nlord de Croy to Crotoy, and the lord de Humbercourt to Beaurain; and\nsir Reginald Pot was, at his request, appointed governor of Dauphiny\nfor the dauphin. Soon after this, the king relapsed into his usual\ndisorder, and was put under good guard. Those who were intrusted with\nthe reform of abuses continued daily at work, and with such success\nthat large sums were recovered from the late directors of the finances.\n\nAt this period, the princes and council of state went often to the\ncastle of Vincennes, where the queen resided,--for without her\nknowledge no business of any importance was carried on. The dukes of\nBerry and Bourbon, however, were much discontented that they were not\nso often summoned to the council as before, and that their authority\nwas greatly lessened. Seeing themselves, as it were, banished from the\ngovernment, they took leave of the king, queen, and princes, and each\nretired to his own domains.\n\nThe cardinal de Thurey had come to Paris to solicit the university\nand council of state to consent that pope Alexander might levy\ntwo-tenths on the gallican church, to defray the great expenses he was\nbound to pay. This request was not granted, because the university\nopposed it, in the name of the whole church. The better to effect\nthis, the university required and obtained a royal mandate, to\ncommand all officers under the crown forcibly to send out of their\njurisdictions all persons who should come thither making similar\ndemands. The solicitors of this levy had brought to Paris with them\na bull containing many novelties, which were not usually advanced,\nnamely, that the tythes, and other things, such as oblations to the\nchurch, belonged to them in preference to the parochial clergy, for\nthat in fact they were in the same capacity, inasmuch as whoever should\nconfess themselves to them were not under the necessity of so doing to\ntheir own clergyman. This doctrine they publicly preached throughout\nParis, and the members of the university preached in opposition to it,\nso that during Lent the whole town was in confusion and discord by\nthese quarrels of the university and the mendicants, until they were\ndriven out of it by the university. The Jacobins, however, as the most\nprudent, renounced the bull, and made oath that they would never claim\nany advantages from it, nor from other privileges that had been granted\nto them. By this means, they were reconciled to the university. The\npope, at this period, held his court with great state in Bologna la\nGrassa.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XVI.\n\n    A GREAT DISSENSION TAKES PLACE THIS YEAR BETWEEN THE KING OF\n    POLAND, ON THE ONE HAND, AND THE GRAND MASTER OF PRUSSIA AND\n    HIS KNIGHTS ON THE OTHER.\n\n\nThis year, a great quarrel arose between the king of Poland and the\ngrand master of the Teutonic order in Prussia; and the king assembled a\nlarge force from different nations, which he marched into Prussia, with\nthe intent to destroy it.\n\nThe grand master and his brethren soon made themselves ready to meet\nhim with a great army, and showed every inclination to give him battle;\nbut when the two armies were in sight of each other, through the will\nof God, the king of Poland retreated with his forces, among which were\ntwenty thousand Tartars at least, without counting his Polanders and\nothers his Christian allies, who were very numerous, and returned to\nhis own country.\n\nAfterward, the king of Lithuania, by the exhortations of the king of\nPoland, invaded Prussia with an immense army, and destroyed the greater\npart which lay on the sea-shores. The Prussians made a thousand of them\nprisoners, and slew many.\n\nThe king of Poland was formerly an infidel, and son to the king of\nLithuania, but, having a great ambition to reign, murdered his father,\nand was for this crime banished the country. He took refuge with the\nthen king of Poland, who received him kindly, and admitted him into his\nfriendship and confidence. He also gained the affections of the princes\nand nobles, insomuch that, on the death of their king, they unanimously\nelected this parricide to succeed him, had him baptised, and married\nhim to the widow of the late king; and, since that time, he has happily\nenough governed that kingdom[53].\n\nAt this period, Sigismond king of Hungary, brother to the king of\nBohemia, took to wife the sister of the above queen of Poland: they\nwere daughters to a german count, called the count de Cilly, of the\nroyal branch of Hungary[54]. The king of Poland laid claim to Hungary\nin right of his wife, and thence took occasion to harrass that country\nas well as Prussia. He sent secret messengers to the king of Lithuania,\nhis cousin german and ally, to press him to invade Prussia on the\nquarter nearest the sea, when he would march his Polanders to form a\njunction and destroy the whole of it. His intentions were discovered\nby the messenger being arrested by orders of the king of Hungary, and\ninformation sent of them to Prussia, whenceforward the king of Hungary\nand grand master took such wise precautions that his future attempts\nwere fruitless.\n\n\n\n\n[A. D. 1410.]\n\nCHAP. XVII.\n\n    THE DUKE OF BERRY, BY THE KING\u2019S COMMANDS, RETURNS TO\n    PARIS.--THE MARRIAGE OF THE SON OF THE KING OF SICILY.--THE\n    ASSEMBLY THAT IS HOLDEN AT MEUN LE CHASTEL.\n\n\nThis year, the duke of Berry was, by the king\u2019s orders, remanded to\nParis, and, on his arrival, was sent, with the king of Navarre, to\nGiens sur Loire, to put an end to the quarrels between the duke of\nBrittany and the count and countess of Penthievre. Although both\nparties had promised to meet them, they did not personally attend, but\nsent commissioners.\n\nThe king of Navarre and the duke of Berry took great pains, and\nproposed various means, to bring about a reconciliation. Finding all\ntheir attempts fruitless, they referred the whole matter, with the\nconsent of the commissioners, to the king\u2019s decision on All-saints-day\nnext coming, and then they returned to Paris.\n\nIn this year was concluded the marriage between the eldest son of Louis\nking of Sicily, and Catherine, daughter to the duke of Burgundy. The\nlady was conducted by sir John de Ch\u00e2lons, lord de Darlay, the lord de\nSt George, sir William de Champdivers, and sir James de Courtjambe, to\nAngers, and there delivered to the queen of Sicily, who received her\nmost affectionately and honourably,--and she magnificently entertained\nthe knights who had brought her. After a short stay at Angers, they\nreturned to their lord, the duke of Burgundy, at Paris.\n\nAt this time, the dukes of Orleans and Bourbon, the counts de Clermont,\nd\u2019Alen\u00e7on, d\u2019Armagnac, the lord Charles d\u2019Albreth, constable, and many\nother lords of great power and authority, held a meeting in the town\nof Meun le Ch\u00e2tel,--where they had several long consultations with\neach other on the state of public affairs, and particularly as to the\nmurder of the late duke of Orleans, principally to consider how they\nshould proceed to take vengeance on the person who had committed it.\nMany different opinions were urged: one was, that the duke of Orleans\nshould declare a deadly war against him, and carry it on by every\npossible means, with the assistance of his relations, friends, and the\nwellwishers to his cause.\n\nOthers said, it would be better to follow another course, and\nremonstrate strongly to the king, their sovereign lord, on the\nnecessity he was under to do strict justice on the duke of Burgundy,\nto which he was the more particularly bound, as the murder was\ncommitted on his own brother. But, as they could not all agree in the\nsame opinion, they broke up the meeting, and appointed another day to\nassemble again.\n\nBefore they separated, a treaty of marriage was entered upon between\nCharles duke of Orleans and the daughter of the count d\u2019Armagnac. She\nwas niece to the duke of Berry by her mother\u2019s side, and sister[55]\nto the count de Savoye. This done, the lords departed for their own\ndomains.\n\nThe duke of Burgundy resided in Paris, and ruled there more\ndespotically than any other of the princes: affairs were solely carried\non by him and his partisans, which, no doubt, made very many jealous of\nhim.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XVIII.\n\n    THE KING OF SICILY GOES TO PROVENCE AND TO BOLOGNA, TO MEET HIS\n    RIVAL KING LADISLAUS.--THE DEATH OF POPE ALEXANDER, AND THE\n    ELECTION OF POPE JOHN.\n\n\nAbout this period, Louis king of Sicily set out from Paris with a\nnumerous body of men at arms, and went for Provence, and thence to\nBologna, to meet king Ladislaus, his opponent, and to defend his\nkingdom of Naples, where his rival was committing great devastation.\nKing Louis had for this raised so considerable a force, that he might\nbe enabled to offer him combat; and he had also the hope that pope\nAlexander would assist him, to the utmost of his ability, in money and\nin men.\n\nAn end was soon put to his expectations in this respect; for, on the\nmorrow of the feast of the discovery of the holy cross, pope Alexander\nwas poisoned in the town of Bologna, as was currently reported, and\ndied most pitifully. His bowels were interred, and his obsequies were\nperformed in the church of the Cordeliers. Mass was celebrated by the\ncardinal de Vimers: the deacon and under deacon were the cardinals\nd\u2019Espaigne and de Thurey. The whole court was dressed in deep mourning.\n\nThe 6th of May, the corpse of the pope, having been embalmed with fine\nspices, was placed in the hall of audience, dressed in his papal robes,\nhis face uncovered, gloves on his hands, but his feet naked, so that\nwhoever pleased might kiss them,--and nine funeral services were there\nperformed.\n\nThere were present twenty cardinals, two patriarchs, four archbishops,\ntwenty-four bishops, with many prelates, abbots, and other churchmen.\nHis escutcheon of arms were placed at the four corners of his coffin;\nand for nine days, masses were celebrated in the same manner as on the\nmorrow of his death. The masses were said by the cardinals in rotation;\nand the ninth day, the body was carried to the Cordeliers for interment.\n\nThe two first bearers were the cardinals de Vimers and de Challant,\nand the two last the cardinals d\u2019Espaigne and de Thurey. The cardinal\nMilles preceded the body bearing a cross. The chorists were the\ncardinals de Bar, (not the son of the duke of Bar, but the cardinal of\nBar[56] in Calabria), and d\u2019Orsini. The cardinal de Vimers performed\nthe service, as he had done at the interment of the bowels.\n\nWhen this ceremony was over, the cardinals returned home dressed in\nblack; and after dinner, they assembled at the palace, and entered\ninto conclave, where they remained shut up from the Wednesday to the\nSaturday following. Some of the cardinals, having consulted together,\nproposed Balthazar, cardinal of Bologna, as sovereign pontiff of\nthe universal church; and the others, who were not of this opinion,\nseeing their numbers were very small, consented to it; and the new\npope was conducted by them to the church of St Peter, where they placed\nthe tiara on his head, and took the oaths of fidelity to him. They\nthen led him to the palace of his predecessor, where every piece of\nfurniture had been carried off, and there did not remain even a door or\nwindow-frame.\n\nOn the morrow, he took the name of pope John XXIII. and great were the\nrejoicings and feasts that ensued. In the procession were twenty-three\ncardinals, two patriarchs, three archbishops, twenty-seven abbots,\nmitred and non-mitred, without reckoning other churchmen, who were\nalmost numberless. The pope wore on that day a silver-gilt tiara bound\nwith white. The following Saturday, the 23d of May, the pope received,\nin the chapel of his predecessors, the holy order of priesthood, when\nthe cardinal de Vimers said the mass, and the cardinal de Challant was\ndeacon: at this service, all the before-named prelates attended.\n\nOn the following day, Sunday, the pope celebrated mass in the church\nof St Peter, having the cardinal de Vimers near him to show him the\nservice. The marquis of Ferrara and the lord of Malatesta were present,\nand held the bason wherein the pope washed his hands. The marquis of\nFerrara had brought with him fifty-four knights, all clothed in scarlet\nand blue, having five trumpets and four companies of minstrels, each\nplaying on a different instrument.\n\nWhen mass was finished, pope John was carried out of the church to a\nvery handsome platform erected without the porch, and there solemnly\ncrowned in the presence of all those whom I have mentioned, and a great\nmultitude of doctors and clergy.\n\nWhen seated on his throne, which was covered all over with cloth of\ngold, he was surrounded by the cardinals de Vimers, de Challant, de\nMilles, d\u2019Espaigne, de Thurey, and de Bar, having tufts of tow in their\nhands. The cardinals lighted their tufts; and as the flame was suddenly\nextinguished, they addressed the pope, saying, \u2018Thus, holy father,\npasses the glory of this world!\u2019 This was done three times.\n\nThe cardinal de Vimers having said some prayers over him and on the\ncrown, placed it upon his head. This crown was a triple one: the first\nof gold, which encircled the forehead within the mitre; the second\nof gold and silver, about the middle of the mitre; and the third, of\nvery fine gold, surmounted it. He was then led down from the platform,\nand placed on a horse covered over with scarlet furniture. The horses\nof the cardinals and bishops, &c. were caparisoned in white; and in\nthis state he was conducted from street to street, making every where\nthe sign of the cross, until he came to where the Jews resided, who\npresented him with a manuscript of the Old Testament. He took it with\nhis own hand, and, having examined it a little, threw it behind him,\nsaying, \u2018Your religion is good, but this of ours is better.\u2019\n\nAs he departed, the Jews followed him, intending to touch him,--in the\nattempt of which, the caparison of his horse was all torn.--Wherever\nhe passed, the pope distributed money,--that is to say, quadrini and\nmailles of Florence, with other coins. There were before and behind him\ntwo hundred men at arms, each having in his hand a leathern mallet,\nwith which they struck the Jews in such wise as it was a pleasure to\nsee.\n\nOn the morrow, he returned to his palace, accompanied by the cardinals\ndressed in crimson,--the patriarchs in like manner,--the archbishops\nand bishops in similar dresses, having white mitres on their heads,\nand numbers of mitred and non-mitred abbots. In this procession were,\nthe marquis of Ferrara[57], the lord Malatesta[58], the lord of\nGaucourt[59], and others, to the amount of forty-four, as well dukes as\ncounts and knights of Italy, all dressed out in their liveries. In each\nstreet, two and two by turns led the pope\u2019s horse by the bridle,--the\none on the right hand, and another on the left.\n\nThere were thirty-six bagpipes and trumpets, and ten bands of minstrels\nplaying on musical instruments, each band consisting of three\nperformers. There were also singers, especially those of the chapel of\nhis predecessor, as well as those belonging to the cardinals and from\ndifferent parts of Italy, who rode before the pope loudly chaunting\nvarious airs, sacred and profane.\n\nWhen he arrived at the palace, he gave his peace to all the cardinals,\nwho, according to their rank in the college, kissed his foot, hand, or\nmouth. The cardinal de Vimers first performed the ceremony, and was\nfollowed by the other cardinals, patriarchs, archbishops, bishops,\nabbots and clergy. He then gave his benediction to the four elements,\nand to all persons in a state of grace, as well to those absent as\npresent, and bestowed his dispensations for four months to come,\nprovided that, during this time, three Pater-nosters should be said by\neach in praying for his predecessor, pope Alexander.\n\nPope John then went to dinner, as it was now about twelve o\u2019clock, and\nthis ceremony had commenced between five and six in the morning.\n\nIn honour of him, feasts were continued at Bologna for the space\nof eight days; and on each of them very handsome processions were\nmade round St Peter\u2019s church, when the prelates were all dressed\nin vermilion robes, with copes of the same. In like manner did the\nCarthusians of St Michael\u2019s Mount, without the walls of Bologna.\n\nThe next day, the 25th of May, pope John held a consistory, in the\npresence of the cardinals, patriarchs, archbishops, bishops, and\npresented to the marquis of Ferrara and the italian heralds, many and\nvarious rich gifts. This was followed by a great feast, with dancing\nand music. The ensuing day, the pope revoked all that his predecessor\nhad done, excepting what he had confirmed, or what had been taken\ncorporal or spiritual possession of.\n\nKing Louis of Sicily arrived at Bologna the Friday after the coronation\nof the pope, and twenty-two cardinals, two patriarchs, six archbishops,\ntwenty bishops and eighteen abbots, handsomely equipped, went out of\nthe city to meet him: on his entrance, he went directly to the pope. He\nwas clothed in scarlet, and his horse\u2019s furniture was ornamented with\nsmall gilt bells: he was attended by about fifty knights dressed in his\nuniform. It was the last day of May that the king arrived,--and he was\nmost graciously received by the pope.\n\nThe ensuing day, the Florentines came to pay their duty and reverence\nto the holy father. They were about three hundred horse, among whom\nwere eighteen knights dressed in scarlet, with feathers bespangled\nwith gold. They were attended by six trumpets, two heralds, and ten\nmusicians playing on different instruments. When they had made their\nreverence to the pope, they returned to their h\u00f4tels, and the next\nday went to court. By reason of their alliance with king Louis, they\nsupplicated the pope to give him assistance against his adversary king\nLadislaus, adding, that they intended affording him every aid in their\npower of men and money. These Florentines were very indignant at the\nlate conduct of the Genoese in regard to the king of Sicily; for when\nthe king of Sicily was sailing with five gallies from Marseilles,\nnear to the port of Genoa, the Genoese, being in the interest of king\nLadislaus, hastily armed fifteen gallies with cross-bows and men at\narms, and sent them to attack the remainder of king Louis\u2019s fleet that\nwas following him, which they conquered, all but one, that escaped\nback to Marseilles by superior sailing, and carried the crews and all\ntheir baggage prisoners to Genoa.\n\nThe pope, having heard their request, asked some time to consider of\nit before he gave an answer. He could not well consent to it, because\nthe Genoese had been long connected with him, and he had also entered\ninto some engagements with king Ladislaus. The matter was, therefore,\ndeferred. King Louis was, notwithstanding this, magnificently feasted\nby the pope and cardinals; after which, he left his court well pleased,\nand returned to Provence.\n\nOn the first day of June, the pope held an open court, and signed many\ngraces and benefices, and all such things as with honour and justice he\ncould sign. He continued from that time to hold public audiences, and\nto do whatever business appertained to the papacy.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XIX.\n\n    THE GRAND MASTER OF PRUSSIA MARCHES A POWERFUL ARMY OF\n    CHRISTIANS INTO LITHUANIA.\n\n\nThis year, 1410, the grand master of the Teutonic order, accompanied\nby his brother knights and a numerous army of three hundred thousand\nChristians, invaded the kingdom of Lithuania, to destroy the whole of\nit. The king of Lithuania was soon ready to meet him; and, aided by\nthe king of Sarmatia, he assembled an army of four hundred thousand\ninfidels, and offered battle.\n\nThe Christians gained a complete victory,--for there remained dead on\nthe field full thirty-six thousand infidels, the principals of whom\nwere the grand general of Lithuania and the constable of Sarmatia. The\nremnant, with the other officers, escaped by flight. Of the Christians,\nonly two hundred were slain, but a great many were wounded.\n\nShortly after, the king of Poland, who was a determined enemy to\nthe grand master of Prussia, (and who had but faintly accepted of\nChristianity in order to obtain his kingdom) marched his Polanders to\nthe assistance of the infidels, whom he strongly pressed to renew the\nwar against Prussia, insomuch that, eight days after this defeat, the\nking of Poland, in conjunction with the aforesaid two kings, assembled\nan army of six hundred thousand men, and marched against the grand\nmaster of Prussia, and other Christian lords. A battle ensued, which\nwas lost by the Christians, who had more than sixty thousand killed\nand wounded. In the number of dead were the grand master of Prussia,\nwith a noble knight from Normandy, called sir John de Ferriere, son to\nthe lord de Ferriere, and another from Picardy, son to the lord du Bos\nd\u2019Ancquin.\n\nIt was currently reported that the day had been lost through the fault\nof the constable of Hungary, who commanded the second squadron of the\nChristians, by running away with all his Hungarians. The infidels,\nhowever, did not gain the glory without loss,--for without counting\nthe Polanders, who had ten thousand men slain, they lost upward of\nsix-score thousand men, according to the reports of the heralds, and\nthe bastard of Scotland, called the count de Hembe[60].\n\nThe lord de Kyeuraing and John de Grez, Hainaulters, were there, and\nwith them full twenty-four gentlemen, their countrymen, who were unhurt\nat this battle, and returned home as speedily as they could.\n\nAfter the engagement, the infidels entered Prussia, and despoiled\nmany parts of it, and took twelve inclosed towns in a short time and\ndestroyed them. They would have persevered in their wickedness, and\nhave done further mischief, had not a valiant knight of the Teutonic\norder, named Charles de Mouroufle[61], rallied a great number of the\nChristians who had fled, and by his prudence and vigour regained the\ngreater part of these towns, and finally driven the infidels out of the\ncountry[62].\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XX.\n\n    THE DUKE OF BERRY QUITS PARIS, AND RETIRES TO HIS OWN\n    ESTATES.--HE GOES AFTERWARD TO ANGERS, AND UNITES WITH THE DUKE\n    OF ORLEANS AND THE OTHER PRINCES OF HIS PARTY.\n\n\nThe duke of Berry, finding that he had not that government of the\nking and the duke of Acquitaine to which he had been accustomed,\nbecame very discontented, and retired to his estates, indignant at\nthe ministers, and particularly at his nephew and godson, the duke\nof Burgundy. Shortly after, he went to Angers, where the dukes of\nOrleans and of Bourbon, and all the principal lords of that party, were\nassembled.\n\nThey went in a body to the cathedral church, and there made oath, in\nthe most solemn manner, to support each other, and mutually to defend\ntheir honour against all who should attempt any thing against it,\nexcepting the king, and ever to remain in strict friendship united,\nwithout acting to the contrary in any kind of measure.\n\nMany great lords in France were not pleased with this confederation;\nand when, shortly after, news of it was brought to the king and his\ncouncil, he was much astonished and dissatisfied therewith.\n\nThe king, in consequence of the advice of the duke of Burgundy and his\nfriends, marched out of Paris, accompanied by him, the duke of Brabant,\nthe count de Montagu, and a large body of chivalry, and went to Senlis:\nthence to the town of Creil, to regain the castle of that place, which\nthe duke of Bourbon held, and had given the government of it to some of\nhis people.\n\nThe governor made so many delays before he surrendered it that the\nking became much displeased; and because they had not obeyed his\nfirst summons, the garrison were made prisoners, and carried bound\nto the prisons of the Ch\u00e2telet in Paris. The countess of Clermont,\ncousin-german to the king, soon after made application for their\ndeliverance, and obtained it; and on the morrow the king appointed\nanother garrison, and returned to Paris.\n\nThis expedition was not very agreeable to the Orleans-faction,--and\nthey continued to collect daily, and inlist in their party as many as\nthey could.\n\nThe duke of Burgundy became very uneasy at their proceedings; for he\nsuspected the duke of Orleans and his party would infringe the peace\nwhich had so lately been patched up between them at Chartres, or that\nthey would march a large force to Paris, to seize the government,\ntogether with the persons of the king and duke of Acquitaine.\n\nTo obviate this, he caused several royal summons to be proclaimed in\nvarious parts of the realm, for the assembling of men at arms and\nquartering them in the villages round Paris, to be ready to defend the\nking and his government against the ill-intentioned. By the advice of\nhis brothers and the king of Navarre, he resolved to defend himself\nby force against his adversaries, and caused it to be proclaimed\nthroughout the kingdom, in the king\u2019s name, that no one should dare to\nassemble armed in company of the dukes of Berry and Orleans, and their\nallies, under pain of corporal punishment and confiscation of goods.\n\nThe Orleans-faction, however, continued their meetings in spite of\nthis proclamation, and even forced their vassals to serve under and\naccompany them: I mean, such of them as were dilatory in obeying their\nsummons. There were, therefore, at this time, great and frequent\nassemblies of armed men in different parts of France, to the prejudice\nof the poor people.\n\nThose lords that were well inclined to the king came to Paris, and\ntheir men were quartered in the flat country of the island of France.\nThe Orleans-party fixed their quarters at Chartres and the adjacent\nparts; and their forces might amount, according to the estimate of\nwell-informed persons, to full six thousand men in armour, four\nthousand cross-bows, and sixteen hundred archers, without counting the\nunarmed infantry, of which there were great numbers.\n\nIn regard to the army which the duke of Burgundy had assembled by\norders from the king, it was estimated to consist of upward of sixteen\nthousand combatants, all men of tried courage. During this time, the\nking of Navarre and his brother, the count de Mortain, at the request\nof the duke of Burgundy, negotiated a peace between the duke of\nBrittany, their nephew, and the count de Penthievre, son-in-law to the\nduke of Burgundy.\n\nThis was done in the hope that the duke of Brittany would be induced\nto assist the king with his Bretons, and give up the Orleans-party, to\nwhom he had engaged himself. On the conclusion of this peace between\nthe two parties, twenty thousand golden crowns were sent the duke, to\ndefray the expenses he had been at in raising men at arms.\n\nLarge sums of money were also sent to the lord d\u2019Albreth, constable\nof France, that he might collect a numerous body of men at arms, and\nmarch them to Paris, to serve the king. He had not any great desire to\nperform this, for he was wholly inclined to the duke of Orleans and his\nallies, as was perfectly notorious shortly afterward.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XXI.\n\n    THE DEATH OF THE DUKE OF BOURBON.--THE PROCLAMATION OF THE KING\n    OF FRANCE.--THE DUKE OF ORLEANS AND HIS ALLIES SEND LETTERS TO\n    THE PRINCIPAL TOWNS IN FRANCE.\n\n\nDuring this troublesome time, Louis duke of Bourbon, uncle to the\nking of France by the mother\u2019s side, being full sixty years of age,\nfeeling himself oppressed with years and sickness, caused himself to be\nconveyed to his residence at Moulins[63] in the Bourbonnois, where he\ndeparted this life, and was buried in the church of the canons, which\nhe had founded.\n\nHe was succeeded by his only son, the count de Clermont, who, after\nsome days of lamentation, had the funeral obsequies of his father\nperformed, and, having arranged his affairs, returned to the duke of\nOrleans and the other lords at Chartres, and firmly united himself with\nthem, treading in the steps of his late father. The duke of Bourbon\nhad long held the office of great chamberlain of France, from the\nfriendship of the king, and was in possession of it even at the time of\nhis death; but at the entreaty of the king of Navarre and the duke of\nBurgundy, the king now gave it to the count de Nevers, to exercise the\nduties of it in the usual manner.\n\nAt this time, the duchess of Brittany, daughter to the king of France,\nwas brought to bed of a son; and she sent to request the duke of\nAcquitaine, her brother, to stand godfather. He sent, as his proxy,\nsir David de Brimeu, knight, lord of Humbercourt, with a handsome\npresent of jewels, which sir David gave her on the part of the duke of\nAcquitaine.\n\nThe king again issued his summons to the different bailiwicks and\nseneschalships in the realm, for all persons to arm without delay who\nwere bounden so to do from the tenure of their fiefs or arriere fiefs,\nand to march instantly to Paris to serve the king against the dukes of\nOrleans, Berry, Bourbon, the counts d\u2019Armagnac, d\u2019Alen\u00e7on, and others\ntheir allies, who, notwithstanding the king\u2019s positive orders to the\ncontrary, continued daily to assemble large bodies of men at arms, to\nthe destruction of his country and subjects.\n\nThe above dukes wrote letters to the king, to the university of Paris,\nand to many of the principal towns, to explain the causes why they had\nthus confederated and collected men at arms; one of which, signed with\ntheir signs-manuel, they sent to the town of Amiens, and the contents\nwere as follows:\n\n\u2018To our well-beloved and very dear citizens, burgesses, and inhabitants\nof the town of Amiens, health and affection. We have written to\nour most redoubted and sovereign lord the king of France in manner\nfollowing:--We dukes of Berry, of Orleans, and of Bourbon, counts of\nAlen\u00e7on and of Armagnac, your humble uncles, relations and subjects,\nfor ourselves and all others our adherents, wellwishers to your\nperson,--as the rights of your domination, your crown and royal\nmajesty, have been so nobly instituted, and founded on justice,\npower, and the true obedience of your subjects,--and as your glory\nand authority are resplendent through all parts of the world, you\nhaving been worthily consecrated and anointed by the holy roman see,\nand considered by all Christendom as sovereign monarch and equal\ndistributor of justice, as well to the poor as to the rich, without\nowing obedience to any other lord, but God and his Divine Majesty, who\nhas been pleased most worthily to have gifted you,--may all those who\nare connected with you by blood, by their frank and loyal affections,\nguard and defend your sacred person as your relations and subjects.\n\n\u2018And may we, in particular, as your near relations, and for that cause\nmore obliged to it, set an example of due obedience to your other\nsubjects, and exert ourselves in preserving to you free liberty of\naction in every part of your government, insomuch that you may have\npower to reward the good and punish the wicked, and to preserve every\none in his just rights, and likewise that you may execute justice in\nsuch wise that your kingdom may remain in peace, first to the honour\nof God, and then to your own honour, and to the example of your good\nfriends and subjects, by following the paths of your predecessors,\nthe kings of France, who, by this noble way of governing their great\nkingdom, have ever preserved tranquillity and peace, insomuch that all\nChristian nations, far and near, and even infidels, have had recourse\nto them in their disputes, and have been perfectly contented with their\ndecisions on the cases referred to them, as the fountains of justice\nand loyalty.\n\n\u2018And, most sovereign lord, that your power, justice, and the state of\nyour government may not suffer at present any wound or diminution,\nand that public affairs may be managed according to the principles\nof reason, in such wise as may be apparent to all men of sound\nunderstanding;--\n\n\u2018For this effect, most redoubted sovereign, we, the above-written, have\nconfederated and assembled, that we may most humbly lay before you the\nreal state of your situation, in regard to your royal person, and also\nthat of my lord of Acquitaine, your eldest son. We have likewise to lay\nbefore you the manner in which you are enthralled, and the government\ncarried on, that justice may be restored, and the public weal no longer\nsuffer, as we can more fully explain. Should any persons deny this,\nlet your majesty, by the advice of your council, appoint some of the\nprinces of your blood, and other impartial and unprejudiced persons,\nto inquire into it, in whatever number you in your wisdom may select.\nBut we advise that you speedily and effectually provide for the safety\nof your own person, and for that of my lord of Acquitaine, your eldest\nson, so that your state may enjoy justice and a good government, to the\nadvancement of the public welfare, and that the power and authority\nmay be exercised by you alone, freely and uncontrolled by any other\nperson whatever; and that such a desirable object may be obtained, we,\nthe above-named, offer our earnest prayers, and, at the same time, our\nlives and fortunes, whatever they may be, which God has graciously\ngranted us in this world, for the just defence of your rights, and in\nopposing all who may attempt to infringe on them, if any such there be.\n\n\u2018Most redoubted lord, we also inform you, that we shall not break up\nour confederation until you shall have listened to us, and until we\nshall see that you have properly provided against the inconveniences\nwe have mentioned, and until you be fully and wholly reinstated in\nthat power which is your right. To this, most redoubted lord, are we\nbound, as well in regard to what we have already said, as from fear,\nhonour and reverence to our Creator, from whom originates your royal\nauthority, and also to satisfy justice, and then yourself, who are\nsovereign king on earth, and our sole lord. To your support we are\nurged by our kindred and by our love to your person; for in truth,\nmost redoubted sovereign, there is nothing we dread so much as having\noffended God, yourself, and wounded our own honour, by leaving for so\nlong time unnoticed the aforesaid grievances, which are notorious to\nevery one.\n\n\u2018In like manner as we signify the above to you, we shall do the same to\nall prelates, lords, universities, cities and principal towns of your\nrealm, and in general to all your wellwishers.\n\n\u2018Most redoubted lord, we humbly supplicate that you will deign to hear\nus, and consider of what we have written,--for the sole object we aim\nat personally affects yourself and your government; and we earnestly\nbeg that you will speedily adopt the most effectual measures for the\nenjoyment of your own freedom of action, and that your government may\nbe carried on to the praise of God first, and your own glory, and\nto the advantage of all your good subjects who are anxious for your\nwelfare.\n\n\u2018We have written this, that you may know our intentions, and the cause\nof our assembling, which is solely for the preservation of the personal\nliberty of our lord and king, and the affranchisement of his government\nfrom any hands but his own. For this object we have sought the advice\nof the most prudent men, and shall follow their counsels, with all the\nmeans God has put in our power, to obtain so desirable an end, for the\ngeneral welfare of the realm; and we intend so to act toward our lord\nthe king that God and the world shall be satisfied with us.\n\n\u2018And we most earnestly entreat that for so praiseworthy an object\nyou will join us, and exert yourselves in the same cause; for it is\nnot properly us but the king your lord that you will serve, whom by\nyour oaths you are bounden to assist,--and know that for so doing you\nwill be commended by all men of understanding and prudence. Given at\nChartres the 2d day of December, 1410.\u2019\n\nThis letter, when received by the council of the town of Amiens,\nproduced very little sensation,--for all, or the greater part of the\ninhabitants, were inclined to the duke of Burgundy. When a similar one\nwas read in the council of state, it did not make any impression on the\nking, nor did it seem advisable that the dukes should have an audience;\nbut, on the contrary, orders were sent to them to disband their forces\nwithout delay, on pain of incurring the royal indignation.----They\nrefused to obey this order, and bade the messenger tell the king,\nthat they would not cease assembling until he should grant them an\naudience, and hear their complaints. At this period, the dukes of\nAcquitaine and Burgundy paid a visit to the queen of France at her\nresidence in the castle of Melun, and left there a garrison, having\nbrought back with them the queen and her children to the castle of\nVincennes.\n\nThe duke of Brabant at this time left Paris, to go to his country, and\nassemble his Brabanters to serve the king. Many able ambassadors were\nsent, in the king\u2019s name, to the lords assembled at Chartres; and among\nthem was the grand master of Rhodes, to signify to them that they must\ndisband their army, and that, if they pleased to wait on the king in\ntheir private capacity, he would see them.\n\nThis they refused; and as they continued disobedient, the king took\npossession of the counties of Boulogne[64], Estampes, Valois,\nBeaumont, Clermont, and other lands belonging to the said dukes,\ncounts, and their adherents, of whatever rank they might be. The king\u2019s\nofficers appointed governors to the castles and fortresses within these\ncountries, whom they ordered to govern them at the expense of the\naforesaid lords.\n\nSo very numerous were the forces that assembled near Paris, in\nobedience to the summons from the king and the duke of Burgundy, that\nthe oldest persons had not for a long time seen so many men at arms\ntogether.\n\nAmong the number was the duke of Brabant, with a great force. He was\nquartered in the town of St Denis, where he lived at the expense of the\ngreater part of the inhabitants, as if he had been in the open country.\nThe count de Penthievre, son-in-law to the duke of Burgundy, was there\nwith him, accompanied by a large body of Bretons.\n\nTwo thousand men belonging to the count Waleran de St Pol were\nquartered at Menil-Aubry, and the adjacent villages.--Because the\ncount himself resided in Paris, he one day ordered his troops to be\nassembled under the lord de Chin, for him to march them to Paris to be\nmustered and enrolled for pay; but it happened, as they were marching\nthrough St Denis to obey the order, that a dispute arose between them\nand the Brabanters, on account of some enterprise which the last had\nmade against the lord de Carlian, a native of the Boulonois, so that\nthe two parties armed and drew up in battle-array to decide matters\nby combat. The duke of Brabant was soon informed of this tumult, and\nhastened from Paris to check his own men, and acted so prudently with\nboth parties that an end was put to it; but he was very wroth with the\nfirst promoters of it, for he was married to the daughter and heiress\nof the count de St Pol.\n\nWhen they had marched through Saint Denis, they came before their lord,\nthe count de St Pol, in Paris, who having reviewed them, and paid many\ncompliments to their captains, dismissed them to the quarters whence\nthey had come. In order to pay these troops which had been levied,\nas has been said, by orders from the king and the duke of Burgundy,\nand which amounted, by the muster-rolls, to fifteen thousand men with\nhelmets, seventeen thousand cross-bows and archers, very heavy taxes\nwere levied throughout the realm, and particularly on the city of\nParis. It will be impossible to relate one half of the mischiefs the\narmies of both parties committed: suffice it to say, that churches,\nchurchmen, and the poor people were very great sufferers.\n\nThe Orleans-party, shortly after this, marched from Chartres\nto Montlehery, seven leagues from Paris, and there, and in the\nneighbouring villages, quartered their army, ruining the whole country\non their line of march. The lords and adherents of this faction, as\nwell clergy as seculars, wore, as their badge, a narrow band of white\nlinen on their shoulders, hanging over their left arm, like to a deacon\nwhen celebrating divine service.\n\nWhen the king of France and his council learnt that they had approached\nso near the capital, they hastily dispatched to the leaders the count\nde la Marche, the archbishop of Rheims, the bishop of Beauvais, and the\ngrand master of Rhodes, with some others, to persuade them to disband\ntheir army, and come before him at Paris, in consequence of his former\norders, without arms, in the manner in which vassals should wait on\ntheir lords, and that he would do them justice in regard to their\ndemands; but that, should they refuse, he would instantly march his\nforces against them.--The princes made answer, that they would not\nact otherwise than they had said in their letter to the king; and the\nambassadors, seeing they could not gain any thing, returned to Paris.\n\nIn like manner, the university sent to them an embassy of learned\nmen, headed by Noe\u00e9tz, abbot of Povegny and doctor in divinity, who\nharangued them very ably and gravely. They were very handsomely\nreceived by the princes, especially by the duke of Berry, who, among\nother grievances, complained much that his nephew, the king, should be\ncounselled by such fellows as the provost of Paris, and others of the\nsame sort, who now ruled the realm, which was most miserably governed,\nas he was ready to explain, article by article, when they should be\nadmitted to an audience.\n\nThey could obtain no other reply than that, with God\u2019s pleasure, they\nwould accomplish, to the utmost of their power, the matters contained\nin their circular letters to the university and principal towns.\n\nOn this repeated ill success, the king, by the advice of his council,\nsent another embassy, composed of the queen, the cardinal de Bar, the\ncount de St Pol, and others. The count de St Pol had lately accepted,\nwith the king\u2019s approbation, the office of grand butler of France,\nwhich the provost of Paris had held, through the interest of the count\nde Tancarville, by a gift from the king.\n\nNotwithstanding the queen and her companions were received with every\nhonour, she did not remain with their army, but went to the castle\nof Marcoussi, which is not far distant from Montlehery, with her\nattendants, and remained there some time negotiating with them, and\nsome of the princes daily visited her. Although she acted with much\nperseverance, she failed in her object,--for the princes were firm in\ntheir resolution of marching with their army to the king, and requiring\nthat he would execute justice and attend to the affairs of government,\nand choose another set of ministers than those now in power.\n\nFinding she was labouring in vain, she returned with her companions\nto Paris, and related to the king all that had passed. He was very\nindignant, and much troubled thereat; and on the morrow, the 23d\nSeptember, he ordered all the men at arms that were come to serve him\nto be drawn out, and the baggage and artillery waggons to be made ready\ninstantly to march against the Orleans-party, to give them battle.\n\nWhen all were ready, and as he was going to attend mass and afterward\nto mount his horse, he was met by the rector of the university,\nmagnificently accompanied by all the members and supporters of it, who\nremonstrated with him, that his daughter, the university of Paris, was\npreparing to leave that city, from the great want of provisions, which\nthe men at arms of the two parties prevented coming to Paris,--for no\none could venture on the high roads without being robbed and insulted;\nand, likewise, that all the low countries round Paris were despoiled by\nthese men at arms. They most humbly requested, that he would provide\na remedy, and give them such answer as might seem to him good. The\nchancellor, namely, master Arnauld de Corbie, instantly replied, \u2018The\nking will assemble his council after dinner, and you shall have an\nanswer.\u2019 The king of Navarre, being present, entreated the king that he\nwould fix an hour for hearing them again after dinner; and the king,\ncomplying with his request, appointed an hour for the rector to return.\n\nWhen the king had dined, he entered the _chambre verde_, attended by\nthe following princes: the dukes of Acquitaine, Burgundy and Brabant,\nthe marquis du Pont, the duke of Lorraine, the counts de Mortain,\nde Nevers and de Vaudemont, with many other great lords, as well\necclesiastical as secular. The king of Navarre made four requests to\nthe king: first, that all the princes of the blood, as well on the one\nside as on the other, should retire to their principalities, and never\nmore interfere in the king\u2019s government, and likewise that henceforth\nthey should not receive any profits or pensions, as well from the\nsubsidies arising from their lands as from other exactions, but live\non their own proper revenues until the public treasury should be in\na better state than it was at that moment: however, should the king\nbe inclined to make them presents of any thing, or call them near his\nperson, they should be alway ready to obey him.\n\nHis second request was, that some diminution should take place in those\ntaxes that most aggrieved the people.\n\nThe third, that as some of the citizens of Paris had lent different\nsums of money to the king, of which repayment had been promised, but\nnot made, sufficient assignments on the treasury should be given to\nthem.\n\nThe fourth, that the affairs of the king and realm should be governed\nby prudent men, taken from the three estates of the kingdom. When the\nking of Navarre had ended, the king himself replied, and said he would\ntake advice on what he had proposed, and then give him such answers as\nought to satisfy him and every one else.\n\nWhen this was over, the king showed the same determination as before\nto march, on the morrow morning, against the rebellious lords; but he\nwas overruled, and the queen, with the former ambassadors, were again\nsent to negotiate a peace. On their arrival at the army of the princes,\nshe exerted herself, as it was said very much and loyally; for it was\ncommonly reported that she was in her heart inclined to the Orleans\nfaction.\n\nDuring the time of this embassy, the count Am\u00e9 de Savoye, who had been\nsent for by the king, arrived at Paris with five hundred men at arms.\nHis brothers-in-law the dukes of Burgundy and Brabant, and the count\nde Nevers, attended by many other lords, went out to meet him beyond\nthe gate of St Anthony, and thence conducted him to the palace to the\nking, who very kindly received him.\n\nSome days after, the queen, not having more success than before,\nreturned to the king, and told him that she could not any way bring\nthem to terms, for they were obstinate in their original intentions.\nShe then hastened to the castle of Vincennes as speedily as she could.\n\nOn the ensuing morning, the aforesaid lords quitted Montlehery; and\nthe duke of Berry came to his h\u00f4tel of Vinchestre[65], which he had\nrebuilt, and was there lodged. The duke of Orleans fixed his quarters\nat Gentilly, in the palace of the bishop, and the count d\u2019Armagnac at\nVitry; the rest as near to each other as they could; and at vespers,\nthey had advanced as far as the suburbs of St Marcel and the gate de\nBordelles.\n\nThe king, the duke of Burgundy, and the other princes, were greatly\nsurprised at this boldness; and the Parisians, at their own expense,\ncollected a body of a thousand men armed with helmets to serve as a\nguard during the night, and they also made great fires in very many of\nthe streets. To prevent them from crossing the Seine at Charenton, they\nsent two hundred men at arms to defend that pass.\n\nThe third day, Arthur count de Richemont, brother to the duke of\nBrittany, joined the dukes of Berry and Orleans, with six thousand\nbreton horse, to the great displeasure of the king, and especially of\nthe duke of Burgundy; for the duke of Brittany had lately been summoned\nby the king to attend him with his Bretons, and had, for this purpose,\nreceived a very large sum of money. The duke, in consequence, having\nother business in hand, sent his brother to serve the king in his room.\n\nIt was also said, that the lord d\u2019Albreth, constable of France, had\ndisposed of the money sent him in the same manner, and had employed it\nin the service of the duke of Berry. The army of the princes marched to\nSaint Cloud, and to the adjoining towns, which they plundered, taking\nby force whatever they were in need of. Some of the worst of them\nravished and robbed many women, who fled to Paris, and made clamorous\noutcries against their ravishers, requiring vengeance from the king,\nand restitution, were it possible, of what they had been plundered of.\n\nThe king, moved with pity, and by the importunity of his ministers,\nordered a decree to be drawn out, which condemned the whole of the\nOrleans-party to death and confiscation of goods. While this was doing,\nthe duke of Berry, uncle to the king, hastily sent ambassadors to\nParis to prevent it from taking effect, and in the name of their lord\nrequested that the decree might be a little delayed, when other means\nof accommodation, through God\u2019s grace, would be found.\n\nThis request was granted, and the proclamation of the decree put off:\na negotiation was entered into warmly by both parties, although the\nking was very much displeased that the princes of his blood were thus\nquarrelling with each other, so that he should be forced to proceed\nwith rigour against them. To prevent the effusion of blood, the king\ndesired his chancellor and others of his privy council to exert\nthemselves diligently that peace might be established; and he likewise\nspoke to the same purpose to the duke of Burgundy, the count de St\nPol, and other princes, who promised faithfully that an accommodation\nshould take place.\n\nWhile these matters were going on, the lord de Dampierre, the bishop\nof Noyon, the lord de Tignonville, master Gautier de Col, and others,\nambassadors from the king of France, were sent from Paris to Boulogne,\nto meet an embassy from the king of England, consisting of the lord\nBeaumont, the bishop of St David\u2019s, and others, who had arrived at\nCalais to treat of a truce. It was prolonged from All-saints-day, when\nthe former one expired, to the feast of Easter ensuing.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XXII.\n\n    IN CONSEQUENCE OF THE NEGOTIATIONS BETWEEN THE TWO PARTIES OF\n    BURGUNDY AND OF ORLEANS, PEACE IS MADE BETWEEN THEM, AND CALLED\n    \u2018THE PEACE OF WINCHESTER,\u2019 WHICH WAS THE SECOND PEACE.\n\n\nAfter the ambassadors from both parties, namely those of the king and\nduke of Burgundy on the one hand, and those of the dukes of Berry, of\nOrleans, and of Bourbon, on the other, had held several conferences,\nthe following treaty was at length concluded, on the 2d of November.\n\nThe princes of the blood on each side, with the exception of the count\nde Mortain, were to retire to their principalities, and lead back their\nforces, committing as little damage as possible to the countries they\nshould pass through, without fraud or deception. The duke of Berry had\nliberty, if he pleased, to reside at Giens-sur-Loire, and the count\nd\u2019Armagnac might stay there with him for fifteen days. The king of\nNavarre was to depart for his duchy of Nemours. The duke of Brabant\nmight, if he so pleased, visit his sister, the duchess of Burgundy, in\nthat country.\n\nThe aforesaid princes were to conduct their men at arms so that all\ntrespassing might be mutually avoided on each other\u2019s lands,--nor\nshould they suffer any of their adherents to commit waste or damage, so\nthat all inconvenience or source of quarrel might be avoided.\n\nItem, in whatever garrisons there shall be more men than are usually\nkept, the same shall be reduced to the accustomed number of men\nretained therein for its defence, without any fraud or deception. And\nthat these terms may be faithfully observed, the aforesaid lords shall\npromise, on their oaths, made before such princes as the king may\nnominate, that they will punctually and loyally keep every article.\n\nItem, the captains of their troops shall make oath also to the due\nobservance of this treaty; and if it be the good pleasure of the king\nhe may appoint some of his knights as conductors to the men at arms,\nand superintendents on their leaders, to prevent them and their men\nfrom delaying their march, and also from committing waste in the\ncountries through which they shall pass.\n\nItem, the aforesaid lords will not return near the person of the king,\nunless they be sent for by him, by letters patent under the great seal,\nconfirmed by his council, or on urgent business,--nor shall any of the\naforesaid lords intrigue to obtain orders for their return; and this\nthey shall especially swear to before commissioners nominated for the\npurpose. The king shall make the terms of this treaty public, and all\nthe articles they shall swear to observe.\n\nShould the king think it necessary to send for the duke of Berry,\nhe shall, at the same time, summon the duke of Burgundy, and _vice\nversa_; and this he will observe, in order that they may both meet at\nthe same time on the appointed day, which will hold good until the\nensuing Easter in the year 1411; and from that day until the following\nEaster in 1412, no one of the aforesaid shall proceed against another\nby acts of violence or by words.--Every article of this treaty to be\nproperly drawn out and signed by the king and his council, with certain\npenalties to be incurred on the infringement of any of them.\n\nItem, the king shall select certain able and discreet persons, of\nunblemished characters, and no way pensioners, but such as have solely\ngiven their oaths of allegiance to the king, to form the royal council;\nand when such persons have been chosen, a list of their names shall be\nshown to the princes on each side.\n\nItem, the dukes of Berry and Burgundy, having the wardship of the duke\nof Acquitaine, shall agree together as to the person who shall be their\nsubstitute in that office during their absence; and powers for so doing\nshall be sent to the duke of Berry, as he is at present without them.\n\nItem, the provost of Paris shall be dismissed from all offices which he\nholds under the king, and another shall be appointed according to the\nking\u2019s pleasure, and as he may judge expedient.\n\nItem, it was ordained, that no knight, or his heirs, should in future\nsuffer any molestation because he had not obeyed the summons sent him\nby either of the parties; and should they be any way molested, the king\nwould punish the offender by confiscation of his property. Letters,\nconfirming this last article, shall be given by the king and the\naforesaid lords to whoever may require them.\n\nThis treaty was concluded on All-saints day, and on the ensuing Monday\nconfirmed; and four days after, the greater part of the articles were\nfulfilled. Sir John de Neele, chancellor to the duke of Acquitaine,\nwas, by the king\u2019s command, appointed to receive the oaths of the lords\non each side.\n\nThe king dismissed his provost of Paris, sir Peter des Essars, knight,\nfrom all his offices, and nominated sir Brunelet de Sainct-Cler, one of\nhis masters of the household, to the provostship. He also sent letters,\nsealed with his great seal, to the duke of Berry, appointing him to\nthe guardianship of his son, the duke of Acquitaine.\n\nIn consequence of one of the articles above recited, twelve knights,\nfour bishops, and four lords of the parliament, were appointed to\ngovern the kingdom,--namely, the archbishop of Rheims, the bishops\nof Noyon and Saint Flour, master John de Torcy, lately one of the\nparliament, but now bishop of Tournay, the grand master of the king\u2019s\nhousehold sir Guichart Daulphin, the grand master of Rhodes, the\nlords de Montenay, de Toursy, de Rambures, d\u2019Offemont, de Rouvroy, de\nRumacourt, Saquet de Toursy, le vidame d\u2019Amiens, sir John de Toursy,\nknight to the duke of Berry, and grand master of his household, and the\nlord de St George. The two last were nominated, by the dukes of Berry\nand Burgundy, guardians to the duke of Acquitaine during their absence.\n\nThe two parties now left Paris and the adjoining fortresses and\ncastles; but on the following Saturday, the king was again strongly\nseized with his usual malady, and confined in his h\u00f4tel of St Pol. The\nqueen and her attendants, then at Vincennes, returned to Paris with her\nson, the duke of Acquitaine, and fixed their residence, with her lord,\nin the h\u00f4tel de St Pol.\n\nThe duke of Burgundy went to Meaux, where he was met by the king of\nNavarre;--and thence the duke went to Arras and Flanders, accompanied\nby sir Peter des Essars, late provost of Paris, and his most\nconfidential adviser; and he always gave him the title of provost of\nParis, as though he had still retained the office.\n\nConformably to the treaty, all the men at arms on each side returned\nto the places whence they had come, but plundering the poor people\non their march. A number of Lombards and Gascons had formed part of\nthe army of the duke of Orleans, who were mounted on terrible horses,\nthat were taught to wheel round when on full gallop, which seemed very\nastonishing to the French, Flemings, Picards, and Brabanters, who had\nnot been accustomed to such movements.\n\nBecause the count d\u2019Armagnac had joined the duke of Orleans with a\nlarge body, his men were called _Armagnacs_; and in consequence, the\nwhole of that faction were called _Armagnacs_. Although there were many\nprinces of much higher rank in either party than the count d\u2019Armagnac,\nthey were not pleased if they were not called by this name, which\nlasted a very considerable time.\n\nAs the treaty before mentioned had been concluded at the h\u00f4tel de\nWinchester, where the dukes of Berry and Orleans, with others of their\nparty were amusing themselves, it was called \u2018The Peace of Winchester.\u2019\n\nAll who had come to these meetings at Paris now departed, and those\nto whom the government had been intrusted remained near the person of\nthe king and the duke of Acquitaine. The people expected, that by this\nmeans they should enjoy more peaceable times; but it happened just the\ncontrary, as you shall shortly hear.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XXIII.\n\n    A MEETING OF THE UNIVERSITY AND CLERGY IS HELD ON THE XXIII. OF\n    NOVEMBER, IN THE CHURCH OF ST BERNARD AT PARIS, ON THE STATE OF\n    THE CHURCH.\n\n\nWhen peace had been established, a large congregation was held, by\norder of the university, on the 23d of November, in the church of\nthe Bernardins in Paris,--to which were called, the bishop of Puy\nin Auvergne, many other prelates, and in general all bachelors and\nlicentiates in canon and civil law, although in former times doctors\nonly had been summoned.\n\nThis assembly was holden at the request of the archbishop of Pisa,\nand other legates from the pope, on the subject of tythes, the vacant\nbenefices, and the effects of the dead. But it was opened by the\nadoption of a solemn ordinance, which had been ordained during the\npapacy of Pietro della Luna, respecting the liberties of the french\nchurch, in the year 1406, and since confirmed by the king, his great\ncouncil, and the parliament, namely, that the said church shall be\nmaintained in all its ancient privileges. It was thus freed from all\ntythes, procurations, and subsidies, or taxes whatever. And as the\nobject of these legates was to establish the above impositions, it was\nresolved that the aforesaid ordinance should be strictly conformed to;\nand the more effectually to have it observed, they sent deputations\nto the king, to his council, and to the parliament, to whom the guard\nof this ordinance belonged, to obviate the inconveniences that might\nfollow should any article of it be infringed.\n\nIt was also concluded, that should the legates attempt, by menaces of\necclesiastical censures or otherwise, to compel payment of any tribute,\nan appeal should be made from them to a general council of the church.\n\nItem, should any collectors or sub-collectors exact subsidies to\nthe church, they shall be arrested, and punished by confiscation of\nproperty, and, when they have no property, by imprisonment.\n\nIt was also concluded, that to settle this matter, the king\u2019s attorney,\nand other lords, should be requested to join the university. But it was\nat last resolved, that should the pope plead an evident want of means\nto support the church, a council should be called, and a charitable\nsubsidy granted, the which should be collected by certain discreet\npersons selected by the council, and the amount distributed according\nto the directions of the said council.\n\nOn the ensuing Monday was held a royal sessions, at which the duke of\nAcquitaine, the archbishop of Pisa, and the other legates from the\npope, the rector and the members of the university were present. In\nthis meeting, the archbishop declared, that what he demanded was due\nto the apostolic chamber, by every right, divine, canon, civil and\nnatural, and that it was sacred and simple justice,--adding, that\nwhoever should deny this right was scarcely a Christian.\n\nThe university was greatly displeased, and said, that such expressions\nwere derogatory to the king\u2019s honour, to that of the university, and\nconsequently of the whole kingdom. From what had passed, another\ngeneral assembly was holden on Sunday the 30th of November, in the\nplace where it had been held the preceding Sunday; and it was then\ndetermined that the university should send a deputation to the king,\nto lay before him the words uttered by the legates, and to demand that\nthey should be publicly recanted by them. It was proposed, that in case\nthey should refuse so to do, the faculty of theologians should bring\naccusations against them, on the articles of faith, and they should be\npunished according to the exigence of the case. It was also resolved,\nthat the university of Paris should write letters to all the other\nuniversities in the realm, and to the prelates and clergy, to invite\nthem to unite in their opposition to such tenets.\n\nMany other things were agitated in this meeting, which I pass over for\nthe sake of brevity. It was, however, finally concluded to send an\nanswer to the pope, that he could not have any subsidy granted him in\nthe way which had been proposed. The meeting came to the resolution,\nthat the university of Paris should require from the archbishop of\nRheims, and those of the members of the king\u2019s government who, as\nmembers, had given their oaths to the university, to join in the\nmeasures they had adopted, otherwise they should be expelled the\nuniversity.\n\nIt should be known, that while these things were passing, the legates,\nfearful of the consequences, hastily left Paris, without taking leave,\nas is usually done. The holy father, however, sent ambassadors to the\nking, to demand payment of the tenth imposed on the french church. When\nthey declared the object of their mission to the council of state, and\nin the presence of the duke of Acquitaine, they said, that not only\nwas the french church bound to pay this subsidy to the pope, but all\nother churches which were under his obedience,--first, from the divine\nlaw in Leviticus, which declares that all deacons shall pay to the\nhigh priest a tenth of their possessions,--and, 2dly, by natural and\npositive law.\n\nWhilst these things were passing, the university came to the council,\nand on the morrow a congregation was held in the monastery of the\nBernardins. It was then resolved that the manner of demanding this\nsubsidy should be reprobated, for that it was iniquitous, and contrary\nto the decree of the king and his council in the year 1406, for the\npreservation of the franchises of the french church. The university\ninsisted on this decree being preserved inviolate, and declared, that\nif the pope or his legates attempted to constrain any person to pay\nthis subsidy by censures of the church, it would appeal to a general\ncouncil on this subject. Should any of the new ministers attempt any\nthing against this decree, the university would appeal to the king and\nthe whole council of state; and should any members of the university\nurge the payment of this tenth, they should be expelled; and if any\npersons, guilty of the above offence, should have any property of their\nown, the university would require that the said property should be\nconfiscated to the king\u2019s use, otherwise they should be imprisoned.\n\nShould the holy father adopt the manner of raising this subsidy by\nway of charity, it would be agreeable to the university that the king\nshould call together the prelates of his realm,--first, to consider\nwhat subjects should be discussed in the general council of the church\nto be holden on this occasion; secondly, to deliberate on the demands\nmade by the ambassadors respecting the tenth. Should it be determined\nfor the pope to receive this subsidy, the university expressed its wish\nthat some sufficient person should be deputed from this kingdom to\nreceive the amount of the same, for the peace and union of the greek\nand latin churches, and from England for aid of the holy land, and the\npreaching the gospel to all the world; for such were the purposes for\nwhich the legates declared the holy father raised this subsidy. The\nuniversity solicited the members of the parliament to unite themselves\nwith them, for it was in support of their decree made on the demand of\nthe king\u2019s attorney-general.\n\nJuvenal des Ursins[66] was deputed by the university to reply to what\nthe pope\u2019s ambassadors had advanced before the council; but at length\nthe archbishop of Pisa, perceiving he could not otherwise gain his\nobject, humbled himself much before the university, and spoke privately\nto some of the principal members to prevail on them to assist him.\nHowever, on the 28th day of January, it was declared, that no subsidy\nwhatever should be granted to the pope without the previous consent of\nthe french church; and the deliberation on this matter was deferred to\nthe 10th of February, when many prelates were summoned to give their\nopinions thereon. Through the active diligence of the university, the\nlegates could not obtain consent that a subsidy in any shape should be\ngranted to the pope, although the greater part of the lords, and in\nparticular the princes, were very agreeable to it.\n\nWhile these matters were transacting at Paris, the holy father sent\nletters to the king of France and to the university, to say that\nthe Florentines refused any longer to obey him, from fear of king\nLadislaus; that this king Ladislaus was assembling an immense army,\nas the pope wrote word, to conquer Rome and the adjacent country,\nthat he might place in the chair of St Peter a pope according to his\npleasure. Should this happen, a more ruinous schism might befal the\nchurch than the former one,--to obviate which, he requested from the\nking, the princes, and university, aid and support. This was, through\nthe intercession of the archbishop of Pisa, complied with, and in the\nmanner that shall be hereafter related.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XXIV.\n\n    THE LORD DE CROY IS MADE PRISONER WHEN GOING ON AN EMBASSY\n    FROM THE DUKE OF BURGUNDY TO THE DUKE OF BERRY, TO THE GREAT\n    DISPLEASURE OF THE LATTER.\n\n\nThe duke of Burgundy, shortly after he had left Paris, sent three of\nhis counsellors, namely, the lords de Croy and de Dours, knights, and\nmaster Raoul, head canon of Tournay and of Amiens, licentiate of law,\nas ambassadors to the king at Paris, and to his uncle and godfather,\nthe duke of Berry, at Bourges. But when they were travelling between\nOrleans and Bourges, the lord de Croy was arrested by the officers\nof the duke of Orleans on the last day but one of January, without\nany molestation being given to the other two ambassadors or their\nattendants.\n\nHe was carried to a castle within three leagues of Blois, and, on the\nmorrow, strictly interrogated respecting the murder of the late duke\nof Orleans, and put to the torture to confess if he had been any way\nconsenting to it, or an accomplice in it; but they could not discover\nany thing to his prejudice. On the following Sunday, he was carried to\nBlois, and confined in the dungeons of a prison.\n\nThe other ambassadors continued their route to Bourges, where, having\nexplained to the duke of Berry the object of their mission, they humbly\nentreated that he would exert himself with the duke of Orleans that the\nlord de Croy might obtain his liberty. When they related to him the\nmanner of the lord de Croy being arrested, the duke was filled with\nindignation, and instantly sent letters signed with his hand to the\nduke of Orleans, to say that he must immediately give up his prisoner,\nwhom he had illegally arrested when coming to him; and that if he did\nnot do it, he would have him for his enemy.\n\nThe duke of Orleans, on the receipt of this letter, considered it well,\nand replied at length most courteously to the duke of Berry, excusing\nhimself for what he had done, but putting off the setting the lord de\nCroy at liberty. The king and the duke of Acquitaine were soon made\nacquainted with this arrest,--and they sent letters to the duke of\nOrleans, commanding him instantly to deliver the lord de Croy from his\nimprisonment, on pain of incurring their indignation.\n\nNotwithstanding these letters, the duke of Orleans would not give him\nhis liberty, but kept him in close confinement, where he was very often\nmost rigorously treated, and at times examined and put to the torture.\n\nIn the mean time, the other ambassadors sent messengers to the duke of\nBurgundy, to notify to him this conduct and the means they had taken in\nvain for the deliverance of the lord de Croy.\n\nThe duke was much surprised and vexed at this news, for he greatly\nloved the lord de Croy. Having considered this insult, and others that\nhad been offered to his friends, he thought it time to take effectual\nmeasures for his security, and in consequence amassed as large a sum as\nhe could: to this end, he sold his right to all confiscations within\nthe town of Ghent to the townsmen, and yielded for money several other\nprivileges to the Flemings. He likewise carried his son, the count\nde Charolois, to show him to many of the principal towns as their\nfuture lord, who, on this occasion, made him considerable presents. He\nafterward held a grand council on his affairs, in the town of Tournay,\nwhich was attended by his brothers-in-law duke William and the bishop\nof Liege. The count de Namur was also present, and several great lords\nfrom the borders of the empire. The duke of Burgundy solicited their\naid against his enemies, should need be, and in particular against\nthe duke of Orleans, his brothers and allies. This service they\noffered him liberally, to the utmost of their power. Having obtained\ntheir promises, he went to Lille, whither the marshal Boucicaut, late\ngovernor of Genoa, came to meet him. He received him very kindly, and\ncarried him with him to his town of Arras, whither he had convoked all\nthe lords and nobles of the county of Artois and its dependancies.\n\nWhen they were assembled in the great hall of his residence, he\naddressed them himself, and caused them to be harangued by master\nWilliam Bouvier, knight, licentiate of law, to explain how his enemies\nwere plotting daily to arrest and imprison his friends, and had\nactually arrested and imprisoned the lord de Croy; for which cause he\nhad now assembled them, to request that they would remain loyal, and\nthat, should there be a necessity, they would enter into his pay and\nserve him,--for they might be assured it would be solely in his own\ndefence, and for that of the king and the duke of Acquitaine, that\nhe would ever take up arms. He declared, that it was merely for the\npreservation of the crown to his present majesty, and to his heirs,\nthat he had slain the duke of Orleans, father to the present duke.\nThis death had been lately pardoned, and peace established by the\nking in the town of Chartres, and proclaimed by letters patent. He\nadded, that should any of the conditions of that treaty of Chartres be\nunaccomplished by him, he was ready to fulfil them, and willing to do\nany thing else that would afford satisfaction.\n\nWhen he had concluded his speech, the nobles and knights present\nunanimously replied, that they would serve him to the utmost of their\npower. The meeting then broke up, and each man returned to his own\ncountry and home.\n\nThe marshal Boucicaut went to Paris, and in full council, presided\nby the duke of Acquitaine in the place of his father, he accused the\nGenoese of various crimes, and exculpated himself for having lost that\ntown; and ended by entreating, that he might be sufficiently supplied\nwith men and money to offer them battle and regain it.\n\nThe council deferred giving an answer at the moment, but appointed a\nday for him to receive it. In the mean time, Boucicaut waited on all\nthe principal lords, to interest them in his cause, and to beg that\nthey would press the king and council to hasten a compliance with his\nrequest. It was ordered by the council, conjunctively with the three\nestates, that the Genoese should be summoned to appear before them at\nParis, at the feast of Easter, when many of the nobles would be there\nassembled on other weighty affairs, particularly to have their consent\nthat the duke of Acquitaine should be appointed regent of the kingdom,\nfor the Parisians were extremely pressing that this should be done.\n\nThe duke of Berry, however, was much displeased when he heard of it,\nand, to prevent it, wrote urgent letters to the duke of Acquitaine, to\nthe queen, and to the great council, giving substantial reasons why\nthis could not and ought not to be done, considering how very young the\nduke of Acquitaine was,--adding, that he and his brother Philip duke of\nBurgundy, of good memory, had sworn on the holy sacrament that they\nwould support and defend, to their last drop of blood, their nephew,\nthe king now on the throne, against all who should attempt any thing to\nhis dishonour or disadvantage.\n\nWhile these things were in agitation, the king recovered his\nhealth,--and of course, the duke of Acquitaine was not regent, to the\ngreat satisfaction of the duke of Berry, who was much rejoiced thereat.\n\nIn consequence of the quarrel that had now again broken out between the\ndukes of Orleans and Burgundy, the king issued a proclamation to all\nthe bailiwicks, provostships, seneschalships and governments in his\nrealm, to forbid all nobles, of whatever rank they might be, and every\nother person, to obey the summons or join in arms either of the above\ndukes, under pain of their property being confiscated.\n\nOn the Wednesday of the holy week, the duke of Bourbon and the count\nde Vertus, brother to the duke of Orleans, marched five hundred men at\narms to Clermont in Beauvoisis, and thence invaded Normandy. The count\nde Vertus did not remain long there, but, taking a part of the men at\narms, left the duke of Bourbon, and hastened to the countries of the\nSoissonnois and Valois, to the territory of Coucy, which belonged to\nhis brother, and there placed a good garrison.\n\nTrue it is, that when the duke of Burgundy heard this, he was much\ntroubled, and, as speedily as he could, ordered his men at arms to meet\nhim at Ch\u00e2teau-Cambresis the last day but one of April. But when these\ntransactions came to the knowledge of the king and council, he sent\nable ambassadors to each of these dukes, to forbid them, under pain of\nhaving all their lands confiscated, and being declared enemies to their\nking and country, to attempt any expeditions against each other, and\ncommanded them instantly to disband their forces. For this time they\nvery humbly obeyed his orders, and deferred proceeding further for a\nconsiderable space.\n\n\n\n\n[A. D. 1411.]\n\nCHAP. XXV.\n\n    THE DUKE OF ORLEANS SENDS AMBASSADORS TO THE KING OF FRANCE,\n    WITH LETTERS OF ACCUSATION AGAINST THE DUKE OF BURGUNDY AND\n    THOSE OF HIS PARTY.\n\n\nAt the commencement of this year, the duke of Orleans was displeased\nthat those ministers who had been nominated by the duke of Burgundy had\ngreater influence than any of the others, and that they daily deprived\nsuch as had been attached to the late duke of Orleans, and were now\nhis friends, of their offices. In consequence, he sent ambassadors\nto the king to complain of this conduct, and to require that the\nmurderers of his father should be punished conformably to the articles\nof the treaty, but who were now residents within the kingdom. To these\nambassadors promises were made, on the part of the king, that proper\nremedies should be applied to give them satisfaction.\n\nOn their departure, the king sent to his uncle, the duke of Berry, at\nBourges, to require that he would interfere between his two nephews of\nOrleans and Burgundy, and make peace between them, which he engaged\nto do; and in consequence, he sent his chancellor, the archbishop of\nBourges, to Paris, well instructed by the duke how he was to act.\n\nShortly after, this chancellor, the marshal Boucicaut, with others,\nwere dispatched to the duke of Burgundy, then at St Omer, who, having\nheard all they had to say, replied, that it was no fault of his, nor\nshould it ever be so, that any articles of the late treaties were\ninfringed; for that in this, and in every thing else, he was very\ndesirous of obeying the king. And this his answer they laid before the\nking and council.\n\nBut as the proceedings against the murderers of the late duke of\nOrleans did not seem to his son, and his advisers, to be carried on\nwith sufficient vigour, he wrote letters, signed with his own hand, to\ncomplain of this and other matters to the king, the contents of which\nwere as follows:\n\n\u2018Most redoubted lord, after offering my humble recommendation,--lately,\nvery redoubted lord, two of your counsellors came to me, namely, sir\nCollart de Charleville, knight, and sir Simon de Nanterre, president of\nyour parliament, whom you had been pleased to send me to signify and\nexplain your good will and pleasure touching certain points, which they\nhave clearly and distinctly declared, according to the terms of their\ncommission.\n\n\u2018First, they require and entreat of me, in your name, who may command\nme as your loyal subject and humble servant, that I should submit the\nquarrel that subsists between me and the duke of Burgundy, for the\ninhuman and cruel murder of my very redoubted lord and father, and your\nown brother, on whose soul may God have mercy! to my lady the queen,\nand to my lord and uncle the duke of Berry, who has been in like manner\nsolicited by your ambassadors to labour diligently to establish a firm\npeace, for the general good of the kingdom.\n\n\u2018They have informed me, that you have also made a similar proposal to\nthe duke of Burgundy,--and that, to effectuate so desirable an object\nas peace, I should send four of my friends to my said uncle of Berry,\nwho will there meet the same number from the duke of Burgundy.\n\n\u2018The second point mentioned by them is, that you entreat I would desist\nfrom assembling men at arms.\n\n\u2018Thirdly, that I would accept of letters from you similar to those\nwhich had been formerly sent me at my request, respecting the\nmurderers, and their accomplices, of my late father and your brother.\n\n\u2018Having very maturely weighed and considered the above points, I reply,\nthat I most humbly thank you, very redoubted lord, for your grace and\nkindness in thus sending to me; and I can assure you, that I have no\ngreater pleasure than in hearing often from you, and of your noble\nstate; that I was, and am always ready to serve and obey you in body\nand fortune, to the utmost extent of my own and my subjects\u2019 abilities.\n\n\u2018But as the matters which they have mentioned to me in your name are\nof very high consideration and importance, concerning yourself and\nyour noble state, and as I shall ever be most anxious to show my ready\nobedience to your will, I was unable at the moment to make them any\nreply, excepting that I would send you an answer as speedily as I\ncould. This I have hitherto deferred, for I know you have near your\nperson, and in your council, several of my bitter enemies, whom you\nought to regard as yours also, and to whom I am unwilling that my\nanswer, or my future intentions, should be made known: neither is it\nright they should be made acquainted with what concerns me, or have the\nopportunity of giving their opinions in council, or elsewhere, relative\nthereto.\n\n\u2018I therefore assure you, most redoubted lord, in the fullest manner,\nthat I am your humble son and nephew, ready at all times to obey you\nas my sovereign lord, and most heartily anxious to honour and exalt to\nthe utmost of my power your crown and dignity, as well as that of the\nqueen, the duke of Acquitaine, and all your other children and kingdom,\nand to advise you most loyally and faithfully, without ever concealing\nany thing from you that may tend to the glory of your crown, or to the\nwelfare of your realm.\n\n\u2018I have some time hesitated to denounce to you such of my enemies, and\nyours also, as are in your council and service, namely, the bishop of\nTournay, the vidame d\u2019Amiens, John de Neelles[67], the lord de Heilly,\nCharles de Savoisy, Anthony des Essars, John de Courcelles, Peter de\nFontenay and Maurice de Railly, who, by force or underhand means, are\ncapable of doing me great mischief, insomuch that they have dismissed\ncertain very able men from their offices, who were your trusty\nservants, and have done them very great and irreparable damages: they\nare guilty also of insinuating very many falsehoods, to keep myself and\nothers, your relations and faithful servants, at a distance from you,\nby which, and other means equally dishonourable and iniquitous, long\nfollowed by them and their adherents, have they troubled the peace of\nthe kingdom: nor is it very probable that so long as such persons shall\nremain in power, and in your service, any firm or lasting peace can be\nestablished; for they will always prevent you from doing justice to\nmyself or to others, which ought indifferently to be done to all,--to\nthe poor as well as to the rich.\n\n\u2018This conduct they pursue, because they know themselves guilty of many\ncrimes, and especially John de Neelles and the lord de Heilly, who were\naccomplices in the murder of my late honoured father, and your only\nbrother, under the protection of the duke of Burgundy, the principal\nin this crime. They are his sworn servants and pensioners, or allies\nto the said duke, whence they may be reputed actors and accomplices in\nthis base and cowardly assassination. These accomplices, most redoubted\nlord, appear daily in your presence, and you ought to consider their\ncrimes in the same light as if done personally against you, for indeed\nyour authority was set at nought.\n\n\u2018That I may now say all that I know, I am satisfied, that had not the\ncourse of your justice been checked by the aforesaid persons and their\naccomplices, ample justice would have been done for the death of my\nlord and father, and your brother, with the aid of your officers and\nloyal subjects, as I know for certain that they were well inclined to\nit.\n\n\u2018For this I am very thankful; and I most earnestly pray you, for your\nown honour, for that of the queen and of the duke of Acquitaine, as\nwell as for the honour of your kingdom, that you would do good and fair\njustice, by causing these guilty persons to be arrested and punished,\nsince they are equally your enemies as mine,--and that you would not\nlonger admit to your presence and councils the partisans of the duke of\nBurgundy, but select in their places good, loyal, and able men, such as\nmay be found in abundance in your kingdom.\n\n\u2018When these things shall be done, I will then, under God\u2019s pleasure,\nsend you such answer, that you may clearly know my inmost thoughts, and\nwhich shall prove satisfactory to God, to yourself, and to the world.\nFor the love of God, I pray you, my most redoubted lord, do not neglect\ndoing this; otherwise I see plainly, that whatever supplications or\nrequests I make to you will never be attended to, although they be\nconformable to reason and justice, and that you will be prevented from\nacting in the manner you have proposed, through your ambassadors to me,\nnor shall I be able to do what they have required from me on your part.\n\n\u2018Therefore, my most redoubted lord, I beg you will not disappoint\nme; for what I have required is but just and reasonable, as will be\napparent to any one. My very dear lord, may it please you to order me\naccording to your good pleasure, and, with the will of God, I will obey\nyou faithfully in all things.\u2019\n\nWhen the duke of Orleans had sent this letter to the king, he wrote\nothers of the like tenour to the chancellor of France, and to such\nof the ministers as he knew were favourable to him, to entreat that\nthey would earnestly exert themselves in pressing the king, queen, and\nduke of Acquitaine, to dismiss those of the council who governed under\nthe name of the duke of Burgundy, and whose names have been already\nnoticed,--and that he might obtain justice on the murderers of his\nlate father. Notwithstanding the many attempts he made by repeated\nletters to the king and to others, he could not at that time, through\nthe interposition before mentioned, obtain any answer which was\nsatisfactory.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XXVI.\n\n    THE DEATH OF THE DUKE OF BAR.--THE KING OF FRANCE SENDS AN\n    EMBASSY TO THE DUKE OF BURGUNDY,--AND OTHER MATTERS.\n\n\nIn this year died that valiant and wise man Henry duke of Bar, and was\nsucceeded by his eldest son Edward, marquis du Pont, in the duchy of\nBar and castlewick of Cassel, excepting a part which he had bequeathed\nas an inheritance, after his decease, to Robert de Bar, son to the\ndeceased Henry de Bar, his eldest son, and to the lady de Coucy,\nnamely, Varneston, Bourbourg, Dunkirk and Rhodes[68]. In consequence\nof his death, Edward was styled Duke of Bar, and began his reign\nprosperously.\n\nAt this period, the king of France sent ambassadors to the duke of\nBurgundy, who, beside what they delivered to him in speech, gave\nhim the letters which the duke of Orleans had written to the king,\ncontaining his charges against him and his accomplices. He was much\ndispleased at this conduct, and made reply by these ambassadors, that\nthe charges brought against him by the duke of Orleans were untrue.\nWhen he had received the ambassadors with every honour, he took leave\nof them, and went to his county of Flanders: and they returned to\nParis without any satisfactory answer to the matters concerning which\nthey had been sent.\n\nIt was not long before the duke of Burgundy raised a large body of men\nat arms, whom he sent into the Cambresis, and toward St Quentin; but\nimmediately after, by orders from the king and council, he dismissed\nthem to the places whence they had come.\n\nOn the 15th day of July, master John Petit, doctor of divinity, whom\nthe duke of Orleans had intended to prosecute, before the university\nof Paris, for heresy, died in the town of Hesdin, in the h\u00f4tel of\nthe hospital which the duke of Burgundy had given him, beside large\npensions, and was buried in the church of the Friars Minors in the town\nof Hesdin.\n\nAt this time, a tax was laid on the clergy of France and of Dauphiny,\nof half a tenth, by the pope, with the consent of the king, the\nprinces, and the university of Paris, and the greater part of the\nprelates and cities, to be paid by two instalments; the first on\nMagdalen day, and the second at Whitsuntide following. It was so\nrigorously collected that the poorer clergy complained bitterly.\n\nDuring this transaction, and while the duke of Burgundy was resident\nin his town of Bruges, on Saturday the 10th of July, sir Am\u00e9 de\nSarrebrusse, sir Clugnet de Brabant, and other captains of the duke of\nOrleans, came, with a numerous body of men at arms, before Coucy, in\nthe Vermandois, and Ham sur Somme.\n\nNews of this was soon carried to the duke of Burgundy, who, suspecting\nthey intended to invade and make war on his territories, gave\ncommissions to several of his captains, namely, the lord de Heilly,\nEnguerrand de Bournouville, the lord de Ront, and some others, to march\na body of men at arms towards Bapaume and Ham, to oppose the Armagnacs,\nshould they attempt to penetrate further into the country.\n\nDuring this time, the duke of Orleans and his brothers continued their\nsolicitations for justice, and again sent letters to the king, princes,\ncities, and prelates, to engage them to unite with them in obtaining\nthe object of their petitions. The tenour of the letter they wrote to\nthe king is as follows.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XXVII.\n\n    THE DUKE OF ORLEANS AND HIS BROTHERS SEND LETTERS TO THE KING\n    OF FRANCE, TO OTHER LORDS, AND TO SEVERAL OF THE PRINCIPAL\n    TOWNS IN FRANCE, TO COMPLAIN OF THE DUKE OF BURGUNDY.\n\n\n\u2018Most redoubted and sovereign lord,--we Charles duke of Orleans,\nPhilip count de Vertus, and John count of Angoul\u00eame, brothers, your\nvery humble children and nephews, have, with all due humiliation\nand submission, considered it right to lay before you, jointly and\nseparately, what follows.\n\n\u2018Although the barbarous and cruel murder of our redoubted lord and very\ndear father, your brother, must for certain be most strongly impressed\non your royal memory, and engraven on your heart,--nevertheless, most\nredoubted lord, our grief and the sense of what is due to us from all\nlaws, human and divine, force us to renew in your memory all the minute\ntransactions of that inhuman event.\n\n\u2018It is a fact, most dear lord, that John, who styles himself duke\nof Burgundy, through a hatred he had long nourished in his breast,\nand from an insatiate ambition and a desire of governing your realm,\nand that he might have the office of regent, as he has clearly shown\nand daily continues to show, did, on the 14th day of November in the\nyear 1407, most treacherously murder your brother, our most renowned\nlord and father, in the streets of Paris, and during the night, by\ncausing him to be waylaid by a set of infamous wretches, hired for this\npurpose, without having previously testified any displeasure towards\nhim. This is well known to all the world; for it has been publicly\navowed by the traitorous murderer himself, who is more disloyal, cruel,\nand inhuman than you can imagine; and we do not believe you can find in\nany writings one of a more perverse or faithless character.\n\n\u2018In the first place, they were so nearly connected by blood, being\ncousins-german, the children of two brothers, that it adds to his crime\nof murder that of parricide; and the laws cannot too severely punish\nso detestable an action. They were also brothers in arms, having twice\nor thrice renewed this confederation under their own hands and seals,\nand solemnly sworn on the holy sacrament, in the presence of very many\nprelates and nobles, that they would be true and loyal friends,--that\nthey would not do any thing to the prejudice of each other, either\nopenly or secretly, nor suffer any such like thing to be done by others.\n\n\u2018They, besides, entered into various protestations of love and\nfriendship, making the most solemn promises to continue true brothers\nin arms, as is usual in such cases, to demonstrate that they felt a\nperfect friendship for each other; and as a confirmation of their\naffection, they mutually wore each other\u2019s colours and badges.\n\n\u2018Secondly, he proved the perverseness of his heart by the manner in\nwhich this murder was committed. Under cover of his pretended affection\nfor your aforesaid brother, he conversed frequently with him; and once\nwhen he was ill, a short time before his death, he visited him at his\nhouse of Beaut\u00e9 sur Marne, and in Paris, showing him every sign of love\nand friendship that brother, cousin, or friend could testify,--when,\nat the same time, he had plotted his death, had sent for the murderers\nto Paris, and had even hired the house to hide them in, which clearly\ndemonstrates the wickedness and disloyalty of his heart.\n\n\u2018In addition to what I have just stated, and the very day before the\nmurder took place, after the council which you had held at the h\u00f4tel\nde St Pol was broken up, they both, in your presence and before the\nother princes of the blood who were there, drank wine and ate together;\nand your brother invited him to dine with him the Sunday following.\nThe duke of Burgundy accepted the invitation, although he knew what\na diabolical attempt he harboured in his heart, and that it would be\nput into effect the very first favourable opportunity. This is an\nabomination disgraceful even to relate.\n\n\u2018On the morrow, therefore, notwithstanding all his fair promises and\noaths, being obstinately bent upon his wicked purpose, he caused him to\nbe put to death with more cruelty than ever man of any rank suffered,\nby those whom he had hired to waylay and murder him, and who had, for\na long time, been watching their opportunity. They first cut off his\nright hand, which was found the next day in the dirt: they then cut his\nleft arm so that it held only by the skin, and, beside, fractured and\nlaid open his skull in several places that his brains were scattered\nin the street; and they then dragged his body through the mud, until it\nwas quite lifeless.\n\n\u2018It would be pitiful to hear of such barbarous conduct towards the\nmeanest subject: how much the more horror must the recital cause, when\nit was practised on the first prince of the blood of France! Never was\nany branch of your noble race so cruelly and infamously treated,--and\nyou and all of your blood, and such of your subjects as wish you well,\nought not to suffer such a lamentable deed to be perpetrated without\nany punishment or reparation whatever, as is the case till this present\ntime, which is the most shameful thing that ever happened, or ever\ncould happen, to so noble a house; and additional disgrace will fall\nupon it, if you any longer delay justice.\n\n\u2018Thirdly, he shows his perverseness and obstinacy by false and damnable\nhypocrisy; for after the horrid deed had been done, he came with the\nother princes dressed in black, to attend the body, pretending the\nutmost grief at the funeral for the loss of his brother in arms,\nthinking by this means to cover the wickedness of his sin. It would be\ntiresome to relate all the damnable and hypocritical arts he employed\nto hide the treacherous and murderous part he had acted, until he\nperceived that his crime must be brought to light by the diligence of\nyour officers of justice.\n\n\u2018He then, and then only, confessed to the king of Sicily, and to the\nduke of Berry, that he had perpetrated this murder, or at least had\ncaused it to be committed; and that the devil had tempted him to do\nit, for that in truth he could not assign any other cause for having\nso done. But he was not contented with murdering his body: he wanted\nagain, so great is his iniquity, to murder his fame and fair reputation\nby false and wicked accusations, when he was no more able to defend\nhimself against them. The falsehood of these charges, through the grace\nof God, is notorious to you and to the whole world.\n\n\u2018My late most redoubted lady-mother, whose soul may God receive!\nsuffered the utmost tribulation, not only for the death of her\nmuch-beloved lord and husband, but also for the inhuman and cruel\nmanner of it; and like one in despair, attended by me, John of\nAngoul\u00eame, she waited on you, as her king and sovereign lord, and\nher sole refuge in this her distress, and most humbly supplicated\nthat you would, out of your benign goodness, have compassion on her\nand her children, and would order such prompt and just judgment to\nbe executed on the perpetrators of this murder as the blackness of\nthe case required; and as you are bound in your quality of king to\nadminister strict justice to all your subjects without delay, as well\nto the poor as to the rich, so rather the more promptly ought you to\nexercise it in favour of the poor and deserted than for the rich and\npowerful; for this upright administration of justice is a great virtue,\nand on this account were kings chiefly appointed, and power intrusted\nto their hands. The case that was then and is now again brought before\nyou requires the most speedy justice; for it not only concerns you as\nking, but affects you more sensibly and personally,--for her husband,\nour much regretted lord, who was so treacherously slain, was your only\nbrother, and, consequently, strict justice ought to have been granted\nto her, and done on the murderers.\n\n\u2018You did indeed appoint a day for doing her this justice; on which\naccount, she constantly employed her agents near your person, to\nremind you thereof: she waited long after the appointed day had elapsed\nfor the judgment which you had promised her,--and, notwithstanding all\nher diligence and exertions, she met with nothing but delays, caused by\nthe means of the aforesaid traitor, his friends and adherents, as shall\nbe more fully explained hereafter.\n\n\u2018However, most redoubted lord, I know for certain, that your\ninclinations were very willing to do us justice, and that they still\nremain the same. Our most afflicted mother, attended by me Charles of\nOrleans, again returned; and we renewed our request to have judgment\nexecuted on the assassins of our late lord and father. We also caused\nto be most fully detailed before my lord of Acquitaine, your eldest\nson, and by you commissioned as your lieutenant on this occasion, and\nbefore the queen, every circumstance relative to the murder, and the\ninfamous charges urged by way of exculpation by the murderer, and the\ncauses why he had committed this atrocious crime. We, at the same time,\nfully replied to what had been argued in his defence; and after this,\nour lady-mother caused conclusions to be drawn against the aforesaid\ntraitor, according to the usual customs of your reign, and required\nthat your attorney should join with her in the further prosecution of\nthe criminals, so that they might be brought to justice.\n\n\u2018When this was done, our very redoubted lord the duke of Acquitaine,\nby the advice of the princes of your blood and divers others of your\ncouncil, then present at the Louvre, made answer to our lady-mother,\nthat, as your lieutenant, he and the princes of the blood, and\nthe members of your council, were satisfied, and pleased with the\njustifications offered by our lady-mother in behalf of your brother,\nour much redoubted father, whose soul may God pardon! and that they\nconsidered him as fully innocent of the charges brought against him,\nand added, that substantial justice should be done to her satisfaction.\n\n\u2018Notwithstanding all these promises, there was much delay in their\nexecution, insomuch that she frequently renewed her solicitations\nto you, the princes of your blood, and to your council, and used\nvarious other means to obtain justice, the recital of which would\ntire you: nevertheless, she could never gain the assistance of your\nattorney-general in prosecuting the aforesaid criminals to judgment,\nwhich circumstance is lamentable to think on.\n\n\u2018For the aforesaid traitor, well knowing your inclination to execute\njustice, knowing also that his crime could by no means be justified, in\norder to prevent matters being pushed to extremity, (notwithstanding\nyour positive orders to him, to forbid his appearing at Paris, with any\nbody of men at arms) came thither with a powerful force, composed of\nforeigners, and several who had been banished your realm, who did great\nmischief to the countries through which they passed, as is notorious to\nevery one.\n\n\u2018Your and our lady the queen, with the duke of Acquitaine, your son\nand heir, and the princes of the blood, were forced to quit your\ncapital before he arrived there. He remained, therefore, in your\ntown of Paris lord paramount, and conducted himself in a tyrannical\nmanner, subversive of your dominion, and contrary to the interests\nof the people. To avoid greater inconveniences and oppressions on\nyour subjects from him and his men at arms, it was judged expedient\nthat you, the royal family and council of state should, according to\nhis good pleasure, come to Chartres, and there grant him whatever\nhe should ask. Thus he thought he should be acquitted of all the\ntraitorous acts and murders which he had committed, by trampling your\njustice under his feet. Consequently he refuses to suffer any of your\nofficers to take cognizance of his crimes, and has not condescended to\nhumiliate himself before you, whom he has troubled and offended more\nthan can be told. He is not, therefore, capable of receiving any grace\nby law or reason; nor worthy of being admitted to your presence, and\nhaving any favours shown to him or to his dependants and friends. He\nshould have presented himself before you in all humility and contrition\nfor his offences; whereas he has done precisely the contrary, and has\nso obstinately persisted in his wickedness that he has had the boldness\nto avow to yourself publicly, and before so great an assembly as met at\nChartres, that he put your only brother to death for your welfare and\nthat of the state.\n\n\u2018He wishes also to maintain, that you told him you were not displeased\nthat it had been done. This has shocked every loyal ear that has heard\nit, and will shock still more the generations to come, who shall read\nand learn that a king of France (the greatest monarch in Christendom)\nshould not have been displeased at the most inhuman and traitorous\nmurder of his only brother.\n\n\u2018This is so manifestly treason of the deepest die against your\nown honour, and that of your crown and kingdom, that scarcely any\npunishments ordered by law and justice are capable of making reparation\nfor it. It is also greatly prejudicial to the far-famed justice of your\ncourts of law.\n\n\u2018Notwithstanding the excuses which he made to you, that the murder\nof your brother had been committed for your personal security, and\nthe good of your kingdom, it is notorious, that it had been plotted\na very long time, through his immeasurable ambition of obtaining the\ngovernment of your realm, as I have before stated. He has declared to\nseveral of his dependants and officers, that there never before was\ncommitted in this country so base a murder; and yet, in his defence, he\nsays it was done for the public good, and for your personal safety.\n\n\u2018It is therefore very clear, according to law and equity, that every\nthing done at Chartres on that day is null and void; and what perhaps\nis as deserving of punishment as the commission of the crime itself\nis, that he never deigned to pay you any honour, respect, or condolence\nfor such a loss as that of your brother, nor ever once solicited\npardon, or any remission for his offence whatever. And he wishes to\nmaintain, that without confessing his guilt, and without demanding\npardon, you have remitted all further proceedings against him, which is\ncontrary to all equity and written laws,--a mere illusion, or rather a\nderision of justice, namely, thus to leave a murderer, without taking\nany cognizance of his crime, without penitence or contrition, and\nto prosecute no inquiry into his conduct, and, what is worse, when\nsuch a criminal obstinately perseveres in his wickedness, even in the\npresence of his sovereign lord. On that same day, however, he fell\ninto a manifest and apparent contradiction; for he says that he has\ndone well, and consequently he assumes to himself merit, and requires\nremuneration,--and, nevertheless, he pretends to say that you have\ngiven him pardon and remission, which circumstance implies not good\ndeeds and merit, but a crime and offence.\n\n\u2018He has never offered any prayers for the salvation of the soul of the\ndeceased, nor any remuneration to those who have suffered from the\nloss caused by him; and this you ought not, and cannot in any manner\npardon.\n\n\u2018Thus it clearly appears, that what was done at Chartres was contrary\nto every principle of law, equity, reason and justice; whence it again\nfollows, that from this, and other causes too long to be detailed, all\nthe proceedings at Chartres are null and of no effect. Should any one\nmaintain, that the treaty made at Chartres is good and binding, it may\nvery easily be shown, that this aforesaid traitor has infringed the\narticles of it in various ways, and has been the first to violate it.\n\n\u2018Although you had ordered, that henceforth he should in no way act to\nour prejudice, and although he had sworn to observe it,--nevertheless\nhe did directly the contrary; for, thinking to damn the good fame of\nour very redoubted lord and father, he caused your grand master of\nthe household, whose soul may God receive! to be arrested, thrown\ninto close imprisonment, and inhumanly tortured, so that his limbs\nwere broken, and made him suffer other martyrdom that he might,\nthrough the severity of torture, force him to confess that our\never-to-be-regretted lord and father, and your only brother, whose\nsoul may God pardon! was guilty of some of the charges which he had\nfalsely brought against him, so that his crimes might be excused, and\nthat he might for ever destroy the honour of our family.\n\n\u2018He had the grand master carried to the place of execution, who there,\nwhen death was before his eyes, declared, on the damnation of his soul\nif he told a falsehood, that he had never in his life seen any thing\ntreasonable in the conduct of the late duke of Orleans, or any thing\nthat tended to the hurt of any individual,--but that he had always most\nloyally served you: and should he have said any thing to the contrary\nwhen under torture, it must have been his sufferings that forced him to\nutter what he thought would please his tormentors. What he now said was\nthe real truth, and he uttered it on the peril of damnation; and this\nhe persevered in to the moment of his execution, in the hearing of many\nknights and other respectable persons.\n\n\u2018This plainly demonstrates, that the duke of Burgundy\u2019s conduct was\nprecisely the reverse to what he had sworn to observe when at Chartres.\n\n\u2018He has received into his h\u00f4tel and supported, and continues daily\nso to do, the murderers who slew your brother, although they were\nespecially excepted out of the treaty concluded at Chartres. He\nlikewise, as is notorious, troubles the officers and servants of our\nlate lord and father, who now appertain to us, and dismisses them from\nall the employments which they held under your government, without any\nother cause whatever but his hatred to us and to our house, and to\nthose servants who are attached to us. He even attempted not only to\nruin them in their fortunes, but to take away their lives by means too\ntedious to relate; but the facts are notorious.\n\n\u2018The traitor, therefore, sensible of the horror of his criminal\ncruelty, and that he could not by any means palliate it, has usurped\nthe government of your kingdom (for the sole cause of his murdering\nyour brother was his unbounded ambition),--and, by so doing,\neffectually prevents your officers of justice from taking cognizance\nof his crimes, and likewise creates infinite grief to all your loyal\nsubjects and wellwishers.\n\n\u2018He detains your royal person, as well as that of my lord the duke of\nAcquitaine, in such subjection that no one, however high his rank, can\nhave access to you, whatever may be his business, without first having\nobtained permission from those whom he has placed around you, and has\nthus driven from you and your family several faithful and valiant\nservants long attached to you, and filled their places with his own\ncreatures, and in great part with foreigners and persons unknown to\nyou. In like manner, he has acted toward my lord of Acquitaine.\n\n\u2018He has also displaced your officers,--in particular, such as held\nthe principal posts in your realm; and as for your finances, he has\nlavished them here and there according to his will and pleasure, but\ngreatly to his own advantage, and not at all for the good of yourself,\nor for the relief of your people, which has caused much discontent\nagainst you. The underlings in office he has sorely vexed, under\nfeigned pretences of justice, and has robbed them of their fortunes,\nwhich he has applied to his own proper use, as is well known throughout\nParis and elsewhere.\n\n\u2018In short, he has introduced such a licentiousness of manners into the\nkingdom that all sorts of crimes are committed, without inquiry or\npunishment following them; and thus, from default or neglect of justice\nbeing done on this enormous and detestable murderer, many other murders\nhave been committed with impunity in different parts of the realm,\nsince the melancholy death of our much-regretted lord and father,\nmurderers and other criminals saying, \u2018Our crimes will be passed over,\nsince no notice has been taken of him who slew the king\u2019s brother.\u2019\n\n\u2018On this account, most redoubted lord, my lord of Berry your uncle,\nthe duke of Bourbon, the count d\u2019Alen\u00e7on, the counts de Clermont and\nd\u2019Armagnac, and I Charles of Orleans, wishing to testify our loyalty to\nyou, as we are bound by parentage, and being your very humble subjects,\nhad intended coming to you last year to lay before you the damnable\ngovernment of your kingdom, and to remonstrate, that should it continue\nlonger, it must end in the destruction of yourself, your family, and\nyour realm.\n\n\u2018In order, therefore, that you may hear us as well as such as may\nmaintain the contrary, let there be chosen a sufficient number of\ndiscreet men to examine into the grievances we complain of; and let a\nremedy be applied to them, providing first for the security of your\nroyal person, and for that of my lord of Acquitaine. This was more\nfully explained in the proclamations issued previously to our coming\nto Paris, when, for our personal safety, we were accompanied by our\nfriends and vassals, all of them your subjects; and our only object in\nthus coming was the welfare of yourself and your kingdom.\n\n\u2018We offered to wait on you with very few attendants, but we could\nnever obtain access to you, nor have a single audience, through the\nobstructions of this traitor, who was alway by your side; and he alone\nprevented the goodness of our intentions being made known to you,\nfrom his persevering ambition and his boundless desire of seizing the\ngovernment of yourself and realm.\n\n\u2018We, therefore, finding all hopes of seeing you fruitless, in\nconsequence of agreements concluded with your council, returned home;\nbut to avoid, if possible, the destruction of your country, we must\nagain confederate.--We faithfully observed all the articles of the\nagreement; but we were no sooner at a distance than our enemy violated\nthem in the most essential part. It had been settled that your new\nministry should be composed of men of unblemished characters, who were\nnot partisans or servants, or pensioners to either side; but he has\nkept those that were attached to him in power, so that he has now a\nmajority in the council, and consequently rules more despotically and\nmore securely than when he held the reins of government in his own hand.\n\n\u2018These grievances are increasing, and will increase, unless God shall\ndirect your mind to provide a remedy to them.\n\n\u2018Pierre des Essars, who had been provost of your good town of Paris,\nand minister of finance, was to be deprived of these offices, and of\nevery employment he held under your name. This was done for a short\ntime,--but he has since obtained for him, by letters sealed with\nyour great seal, a re-appointment to the provostship, under pretence\nof which the said Pierre des Essars has returned to Paris, and has\nattempted by force to execute the duties of that office. He came, in\nfact, to the court of the Ch\u00e2telet, seated himself on the judgment\nseat, and took possession of his office with the knowledge and\nconnivance of the duke of Burgundy,--and it was not his fault, if he\nfailed in success.\n\n\u2018Hence it appears plainly, that the late arrangements have been by\nhim, and those of his party, violated; and that he never had any real\nintentions of keeping the treaty is clear from his having consented to\nthe dismission of Pierre des Essars, and then secretly procuring his\nrestitution. It was also stipulated in this treaty, that all who had\nbeen deprived of their offices for having been in the company of me,\nCharles d\u2019Orleans, and the other lords, at the h\u00f4tel of Winchester,\nshould be restored to them; and that, by your orders, and those of your\ncouncil, sir John de Charencieres was to be replaced in his government\nof your town and castle of Caen,--nevertheless, the duke of Burgundy,\nin opposition to these your orders, had him displaced, and solicited\nthe appointment for himself, from hatred to sir John de Charencieres,\nand, having obtained it, now holds it, which is another infringement of\nthe treaty.\n\n\u2018Notwithstanding, most redoubted lord and sovereign, all the diligence\nand exertions made by our much-loved mother, whose soul may God\npardon! to obtain justice on the murderers of our late very dear\nfather, four years have now elapsed without any judgment being passed\non such enormous criminals, although she pursued every means in her\npower.\n\n\u2018In consequence of this failure or neglect, I, Charles of Orleans, have\nof late most humbly supplicated you to grant me warrants against these\naforesaid murderers, addressed to all your justices, that they might,\non due examination of the charges, imprison and punish, according to\nthe exigency of the case, all or any who may have been implicated in\nthis abominable crime. In this I made not any extraordinary request;\nfor justice is due to all your subjects, and cannot be refused them:\nyou cannot believe that any man, however low his rank, in your kingdom,\nwould have a similar request neglected by your courts of justice, for\nI know it could not be refused. However, in spite of every exertion I\ncould make, I have never yet been able to obtain these warrants, the\nreason of which is, as I suppose, that some of your new ministers are\nimplicated in the crime I am anxious to have punished, and therefore\nwill not suffer such warrants to be issued.\n\n\u2018For this reason, therefore, most redoubted lord, have I of\nlate earnestly supplicated you, that you would, from personal\nconsiderations, and for the good of your realm, dismiss from your\nservice the persons named in my letter,--for I therein charged them\nwith having obstructed public justice and disturbed the peace of the\ncountry. When this should be done, I declared to your ambassadors,\nthat I was willing, from my love to your person and attachment to your\nkingdom, to make publicly known my future intentions, and that my\nconduct should be such as would have the approbation of God and of your\nmajesty; but notwithstanding this, I have not yet had any satisfactory\nanswer to all my repeated solicitations for justice on the murderers of\nmy late regretted lord and father.\n\n\u2018We, therefore, most redoubted lord, again make our petitions that the\naforesaid criminals may be brought to that justice which is due to them\nfor the enormity of their offences; the principal having made a public\nconfession of his guilt in the presence of my lord of Acquitaine, who\npresided, in your absence, at the meeting held at his request in the\nh\u00f4tel de St Pol, and before a numerous body of the nobility, clergy\nand others; and the traitor cannot deny that this his confession was\nmade before a competent judge, and in the presence of such witnesses as\nthe king of Sicily and my lord of Berry your uncle.\n\n\u2018He had before privately confessed to these two persons, that he had\ncommitted the murder without any cause whatever, but through the\ninstigation of the enemy of mankind. This confession, according to\nevery law, ought to be to his prejudice, nor should he be suffered to\noffer any excuse in extenuation of a crime thus publicly and privately\navowed; for he has condemned himself, and ought to have judgment passed\non him accordingly.\n\n\u2018It is very apparent, that such confession requires not any further\nproceedings but the passing of that sentence which the enormity of the\ncrime deserves. Notwithstanding this, our much-regretted lady-mother\nand ourselves have never been able, with all our exertions, to overcome\nthe premeditated delays to obstruct justice; for three years and a half\nare elapsed since we first brought the matter before you, and we are\nnot one step more advanced to the attainment of judgment than we were\nthen. It is painful to consider what may be the consequence of this\nwilful delay of justice to the welfare of your kingdom, and that the\nmost dangerous consequences may ensue, unless a speedy and decisive\nremedy be applied.\n\n\u2018May it therefore please your grace to do your loyal duty, in executing\nthis act of justice, in obedience to God your Creator, to whom judgment\nappertains, and from whom you hold your authority. Have regard also to\nthe good government of your realm, and exert yourself to put an end\nto every obstacle in the way of a just punishment on the traitor. We\nmost earnestly supplicate you to comply with this our request as soon\nas possible, for we are bounden to press you to it, to the utmost of\nour powers, under pain of not being reputed the children of our late\nlamented father, and of being disgraced, and unworthy of bearing his\nname and arms, and of succeeding to his honours and estates: such\ndishonour we will never endure, but would rather suffer death, as ought\nto be the determination of every man of noble heart, of whatever rank\nor estate he may be.\n\n\u2018We therefore entreat you, with all possible humility, that for this\npurpose, and also in order to resist and oppose his wicked intention\nto destroy us by any means whatsoever, it may please you, from your\nbenignant grace, to aid, assist and abet by your power, us to whom\nGod hath vouchsafed so great favour as to cause us to be born your\nrelations, even of your own kin, and your true nephews, children of\nyour only brother,--or, to speak more properly, assist your only\nbrother, who has fallen a martyr to the ambitious views of this\ntraitor. Most redoubted lord, there is no man so poor, who, having had\nhis brother murdered, will not prosecute the murderer to death, and\nthe more earnestly as the criminal displays greater obstinacy. This is\nexemplified in the conduct of our traitor; for it is notorious, that he\nhas dared to write, and to declare to many respectable persons, that he\nslew your brother, whom God pardon! our much-redoubted lord and father,\nfairly and meritoriously. In answer to which, I Charles of Orleans say,\nthat he lies, and I at present decline to make a more ample reply,--for\nit is very manifest, as I have before explained, that he is a liar, and\na false disloyal traitor, and that, through the grace of God, I am, and\never will be without reproach, and a teller of truth.\n\n\u2018Since, therefore, such things cannot fail of being very prejudicial to\nyour realm and to the public welfare, we beseech you most humbly to do\nus that justice which you are bounden to do, and to assist us by every\nmeans in your power, that we may have full and ample reparation for the\nwrongs done us and our family, and that this murder may be punished in\nthe manner it deserves. In acting thus, you will acquit yourself toward\nGod our Creator, and execute justice, of which you are the supreme\nhead, to whom we must have recourse after God.\n\n\u2018That you, our most redoubted lord, may be assured that the contents of\nthis letter are from our free will and knowledge, we, Charles, Philip\nand John, your most humble children and nephews, have each of us signed\nit with our own hands. Written at Gergeau, the 10th day of July, in the\nyear 1411.\u2019\n\nThis letter was sent, by a herald of the duke of Orleans, to the king\nat Paris, and was laid before the whole of the council, where different\nopinions were held as to the contents. Some wished that the brothers\nshould have their requests complied with, and that the duke of Burgundy\nshould be summoned, that they might hear what he had to say in his\ndefence to the charges which they should make against him. But at\nlength the business was postponed, and the duke of Orleans could not\nobtain any favourable answer; for the greater part of those who ruled\nthe king and the duke of Acquitaine were favourers of the duke of\nBurgundy, to whom they shortly after sent a copy of the above letter.\n\nThe duke of Burgundy, on reading it, was convinced that the family of\nOrleans and their friends would very soon declare war against him;\nand in consequence, he immediately began to make every preparation to\noppose them, by forming magazines of stores, and engaging a numerous\nbody of men at arms, in various parts of his possessions.\n\nThe duke of Orleans and his brothers had not only written to the king\nof France, and to the princes of the blood, but also to the principal\ntowns, making complaint against the duke of Burgundy, and requiring\ntheir support. When they perceived that the king and his ministers did\nnot intend to answer their letter, they again wrote to the great towns,\ngiving them to understand, that if redress were not granted them in the\nlegal manner, as they had demanded it, they should seek other means of\nobtaining it.\n\nIt was now ordered by the king, the queen, and the duke of Berry,\nand others of weight in the council, that measures should be adopted\nfor appeasing the quarrels of the dukes of Orleans and of Burgundy.\nAmbassadors were sent to each of the parties, but without success,\nprincipally because the duke of Burgundy would not condescend to make\nany other reparation than what had passed at the treaty of Chartres;\nand his pride was increased by having the king and the duke of\nAcquitaine on his side.\n\nThe Orleans-party were much discontented, but not dismayed; for many\nvery considerable lords were with them, and had promised them aid and\nsupport against the duke of Burgundy to the utmost of their powers. The\nqueen, therefore, and the others employed to negotiate a peace between\nthe two factions, finding their attempts fruitless, gave it up, and on\na certain day made a report to the king of what they had done, and the\nanswers they had received from both parties. Shortly after, the duke\nof Orleans and his faction resolved to make mortal war on the duke of\nBurgundy and his allies, and sent him their challenges by a herald.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XXVIII.\n\n    THE DUKE OF ORLEANS AND HIS BROTHERS SEND A CHALLENGE TO THE\n    DUKE OF BURGUNDY, IN HIS TOWN OF DOUAY.\n\n\nThe following is the tenour of the challenge sent by the three brothers\nof Orleans to the duke of Burgundy, in consequence of the murder of\ntheir late father, the duke of Orleans.\n\n\u2018Charles, duke of Orleans and of Valois, count of Blois and of\nBeaumont, and lord of Coucy, Philip count of Vertus, John count of\nAngoul\u00eame, brothers,--to thee, John, who callest thyself duke of\nBurgundy.\n\n\u2018For the very horrible murder by thee committed (in treacherously\nwaylaying by assassins) on the person of our most redoubted lord and\nfather, Louis duke of Orleans, only brother to my lord the king, our\nsovereign and thine, in spite of all the divers oaths of brotherhood\nand fellowship thou hadst sworn to him; and for the numberless\ntreacheries and disloyal acts that thou hast perpetrated, as well\nagainst our sovereign lord the king as against ourselves, we thus\nacquaint thee, that we shall make war upon and distress thee and thine\nby every possible means in our power.\n\n\u2018And we appeal to God and justice against thy disloyalty and treason,\nand call for the assistance of every worthy man in this world. In\ntestimony whereof, and to assure thee of its truth, we have subjoined\nthe seal of me Charles of Orleans to these presents. Given at Gergeau,\nthe 18th day of July.\u2019\n\nThe above letter was delivered to the duke of Burgundy by a herald\nin his town of Douay, who, having considered its contents, wrote the\nfollowing answer, which he sent by one of his heralds at arms to the\naforesaid brothers.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XXIX.\n\n    THE DUKE OF BURGUNDY SENDS AN ANSWER TO THE CHALLENGE OF THE\n    DUKE OF ORLEANS AND HIS BROTHERS.\n\n\n\u2018John duke of Burgundy, count of Artois, of Flanders, palatine of\nBurgundy, lord of Salines and of Malines,--to thee Charles, who stylest\nthyself duke of Orleans and Valois,--and to thee Philip, who signest\nthyself count of Vertus,--and to thee John, who callest thyself count\nof Angoul\u00eame, who have lately sent me your letters of defiance.\n\n\u2018We make known to you, and to all the world, that to put an end to the\nabominable treasons and mischiefs that were daily plotted in various\nways, against the person of our sovereign lord and king, and against\nall his royal offspring, by Louis your father, and to prevent your\nfalse and disloyal father from succeeding in his abominable designs\nagainst the person of our and his most redoubted lord and sovereign,\nwhich were become so notorious that no honest man ought to have\nsuffered him to live, more especially we who are cousin-german to\nour lord the king, dean of the peerage, and twice a peer[69], felt it\nincumbent on us not to permit such a person longer to exist on the\nearth, and, by putting an end to his life, have done pleasure to God,\nand a most loyal service to our sovereign lord, in destroying a vile\nand disloyal traitor.\n\n\u2018And since thou and thy brothers are following the detestable traces\nand felony of your said father, thinking to succeed in the aforesaid\ndamnable attempts, we have received your challenge with great gladness\nof heart. But in regard to the charges therein made against us, we\ndeclare ye have falsely and wickedly lied, like disloyal traitors as\nye are; and with the assistance of our sovereign, who is perfectly\nwell acquainted and satisfied with our loyalty and honour, and for the\nwelfare of his people, we will inflict that punishment on you as such\nabandoned traitors and wicked rebels are deserving of. In witness of\nwhich, we have had this letter sealed with our seal. Given at our town\nof Douay, the 14th day of August, in the year 1411.\u2019\n\nThis answer, as I have before said, was carried by one of the duke of\nBurgundy\u2019s officers at arms to Blois, and there delivered to the duke\nof Orleans and his brothers, who were very indignant at the expressions\ncontained therein. He nevertheless entertained the bearer well, and,\nhaving maturely considered the matter, exerted himself to the utmost in\ncollecting men at arms to wage war on the duke of Burgundy.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XXX.\n\n    THE DUKE OF BURGUNDY IS DISCONTENTED WITH SIR MANSART DU\n    BOS.--HE SENDS LETTERS TO REQUIRE THE ASSISTANCE OF THE DUKE OF\n    BOURBON.\n\n\nWhen the duke of Burgundy was convinced that he could not avoid war\nwith the family of Orleans and their adherents, for several of them had\nchallenged him by letters and otherwise, he vigorously applied himself\nto collect forces to resist them. Among those who had sent him letters\nof defiance, he was more displeased with sir Mansart du Bos, a knight\nof Picardy, than with any of the rest; but of him, and his end, more\nshall be said hereafter.\n\nHe wrote a letter to the duke of Bourbon, which he sent by Flanders\nking at arms, the contents of which were as follow:\n\n\u2018Very dear and well-beloved cousin, duke of Bourbon and count of\nClermont,--John duke of Burgundy, count of Artois, Flanders and\nBurgundy, hopes he remains well in your good memory. In the year 1405,\nyou and he formed certain alliances, which, three years ago, were,\nat your request, renewed and again sworn to, in the presence of many\nknights and of other persons well deserving credit. In consequence, you\nwere to remain my good and true friend during your life, to promote to\nthe utmost my welfare and honour, and to ward off any evil from me, as\na sincere relation is bound to do; and likewise, whenever any thing\nshould affect my own honour, or that of my friends, you were bound\nto assist them or me, to the utmost of your abilities, in council or\nin arms, and to aid me with money and vassals against all the world,\nexcepting only the persons of my lord the king and of my lord of\nAcquitaine, or whoever may succeed to the throne of France, and of my\nlate fair cousin, the duke of Bourbon, your father.\n\n\u2018Should it have happened that a war took place between me and any\nenemy, whose side the late duke of Bourbon embraced, in that case you\nmight have joined your late father, but only during the course of\nhis life, without any way derogating from the articles of our said\nalliance. Now, as we both have most solemnly sworn to the observance\nof this alliance on the holy evangelists of God, and on sacred relics\ntouched by us, to the damnation of our souls in case of failure, I\ninform you, very dear and well-beloved cousin, that Charles, who calls\nhimself duke of Orleans, in conjunction with Philip and John, his\nbrothers, have sent me a challenge, and intend to wage war on me to the\nutmost of their power; but I hope, through the will of God, and the\nassistance of my friends and allies, in council and in arms, and with\nthe aid of my subjects and vassals, to make a successful defence of my\nhonour against their attempts.\n\n\u2018And since, very dear and well-beloved cousin, you have so solemnly\nbound yourself to assist me on every lawful occasion, I now,\ntherefore, in virtue of this alliance, require and summon you to come\npersonally to my aid, attended by as many of your friends and men\nat arms as you can collect, in opposition to the aforesaid Charles,\nPhilip and John, and thus honourably acquit yourself of your oaths and\npromises,--knowing, at the same time, that on a similar occasion I\nwould accomplish every article of my oaths, without any fraud whatever.\nAnd this I hope you will do.--Have the goodness to write to me by the\nreturn of the bearer, to inform me of your pleasure and intentions, as\nthe necessity of the case requires it.\n\n\u2018Given at my town of Douay, and sealed with my great seal appendant to\nthese presents, the 14th day of August, in the year 1411.\u2019\n\nThis letter was delivered by the aforesaid herald to the duke of\nBourbon, who, having fully read and considered its contents, replied\nto the herald, that he would speedily send his answer to the duke of\nBurgundy. This he did; for in a few days he returned the articles of\nconfederation, which he had formed with the duke of Burgundy, declaring\nthem annulled, and strictly united himself to the duke of Orleans and\nhis brothers, to the great displeasure of the duke of Burgundy, but\nwho at that time could not redress it.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XXXI.\n\n    A ROYAL PROCLAMATION IS ISSUED, THAT NO PERSON WHATEVER BEAR\n    ARMS FOR EITHER OF THE PARTIES OF THE DUKES OF ORLEANS OR OF\n    BURGUNDY.--THE LATTER WRITES TO THE BAILIFF OF AMIENS.\n\n\nThe duke of Burgundy, fearful that many of his friends would desert\nhim, in obedience of the royal proclamation which had been made in\nevery town and bailiwick through France, strictly commanding all\npersons whatever not to interfere, or in any manner to assist the\ndukes of Orleans and Burgundy in their quarrels with each other, wrote\nletters to the bailiff of Amiens, to his lieutenant, and the mayor and\nsheriffs of that place, and to each of them, the contents of which were\nas follows:\n\n\u2018Very dear and well-beloved,--we have heard from several of the\ndeclaration of my lord the king, by which you are forbidden, as well\nas all his other subjects, to arm in our defence, or in that of our\nadversaries. This proclamation has been issued by our lord the king,\nbecause he was very desirous of establishing peace and concord between\nus and our enemies; and for this purpose he had many times sent his\nambassadors as well to them as to us, to which we have alway replied\nlike a true and loyal subject and servant; and, through God\u2019s mercy,\nall our answers have tended to a good end, and to peace and union,\nwhich has made them perfectly agreeable to our lord the king. But our\nadversaries having persisted in the same damnable and wicked purposes,\nwhich they have ever followed against the peace of my lord the king,\nhis noble family, and the public welfare, by continuing to tread in\nthe footsteps of their father, who, for a long time, persevered in\nhis intentions of destroying my lord the king and his family, have\nacted quite contrariwise, and sent answers full of dissimulation and\ntreachery, with the sole design of gaining time.\n\n\u2018Whilst our much-redoubted lady the queen of France, our very dear\nlord and uncle the duke of Berry, and our very dear brother the duke\nof Brittany, were endeavouring, according to the king\u2019s orders, to\nnegotiate a peace between us and our adversaries, these false and\ndisloyal traitors, and disobedient subjects, Charles, who calls himself\nduke of Orleans, and his brothers, sent to us their challenges, and,\nbefore that time, have often scandalously, and in violation of their\noaths, defamed our person and character as they had before done. This,\nhowever, under God\u2019s pleasure, will fail in having any effect, for he\nwho knows all hearts is acquainted with the steady love and attachment\nwe bear, and shall bear so long as we live, to our lord the king and\nto his family, and to the welfare of his kingdom; and we shall ever\nsupport the same with all the worldly possessions and powers that God\nhas bestowed upon us.\n\n\u2018With these views we have done and commanded such acts as have been\ndone, without paying regard to the scandalous defamations that have\nbeen thrown out against us, or any way fearing a diminution of honour\nby such false, wicked, and disobedient traitors to our lord the king,\nas the aforesaid Charles and his brothers, the issue of that infamous\ntraitor, their father, so notorious throughout the realm.\n\n\u2018In truth, we hold it not to have been the intention of our lord the\nking to prevent any of our relatives, friends, allies, subjects, and\nwell-inclined vassals, from joining us, in the defence of our honour,\nagainst our enemies, and to defend our countries from invasion.\n\n\u2018We therefore entreat of you, and require most affectionately, that\nyou will please to allow such as may be inclined to serve us, who live\nwithin your bailiwick, and all others of our friends who may travel\nthrough it, to pass freely without any molestation whatever; for you\nmay be assured, that what we shall do will be for the welfare and\nsecurity of my lord the king, his family, and the whole kingdom, to the\nconfusion of all disloyal traitors.\n\n\u2018Should there be any thing that we could do to give you pleasure,\nyou have but to signify it to us, and we will do it with our whole\nheart.--Very dear and good friends, may the Holy Spirit have you under\nhis care! Written in our town of Douay, the 13th day of August.\u2019\n\nThese letters were very agreeable to Ferry de Hangest, then bailiff of\nAmiens, and to the others to whom they had been addressed, for they\nwere well inclined to favour the duke of Burgundy.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XXXII.\n\n    THE PARISIANS TAKE UP ARMS AGAINST THE ARMAGNACS.--A CIVIL WAR\n    BREAKS OUT IN SEVERAL PARTS OF FRANCE.\n\n\nAt this time the king of France, who had for a considerable time\nenjoyed good health, relapsed into his former disorder; on which\naccount, and by reason of the discontents that prevailed throughout\nthe kingdom, (the seat of government had been transferred to Melon,)\nthe butchers of Paris, who have greater power and privileges than any\nother trade, suspecting that the government of the realm, through\nthe intrigues of the queen and the provost of merchants, named\nCharles Cudane, would be given to the dukes of Berry and Brittany, in\npreference to the duke of Acquitaine, the king\u2019s eldest son, waited\nupon the latter, and exhorted him, notwithstanding his youth, to assume\nthe government for the good of the king and kingdom, promising him\ntheir most loyal aid until death. The duke of Acquitaine inclined to\ntheir request, and granted them their wishes.\n\nThis done, they ordered it to be proclaimed by sound of trumpet in all\nthe squares of Paris, that the provost of merchants, and others in\nParis, who were numerous, and whom they suspected of being favourable\nto the dukes of Berry, Bourbon, and Brittany, and to their parties,\nmust quit the town before a fixed day, under pain of suffering death.\nIn consequence of this proclamation, twelve persons, men and women,\nwithout including the domestics of the above lords, left Paris; and\nshortly after, the duke of Brittany, hearing of these commotions, took\nleave of the queen at Melun and retired into his duchy.\n\nThe butchers, and those who lived near the market-places, with the\ngreater part of the Parisians, were strong partisans of the duke of\nBurgundy, and very desirous that only he, or those that were of his\nparty, should govern the kingdom; and, to say the truth, it was now\nbecome dangerous for the nobility, of whatever party they might be, to\ndwell in Paris, for the common people had great sway in its government.\n\nIn the mean time, the duke of Orleans and his allies were strengthening\nthemselves, by every means in their power, with men at arms. The duke\nof Bourbon and the count d\u2019Alen\u00e7on came in these days with a numerous\nbody before the town of Roye in the Vermandois, which belongs to the\nking of France, and entered it about mid-day, more through fraud than\nby force of arms, for the townsmen did not suspect any warfare. When\nthey had dined, they sent for the principal inhabitants, and ordered\nthem, whether it were pleasing to them or otherwise, to receive a\ngarrison from them. They then rode to Nesle, in the Vermandois,\nbelonging to the count de Dammartin, wherein they also placed a\ngarrison.\n\nThence they dispatched sir Clugnet de Brabant, who had joined them, sir\nManessier Guieret, and other captains well attended, to the town of\nHam in the Vermandois, belonging to the duke of Orleans: they returned\nby Chauni sur Oise, where they also left a garrison, and in many other\nplaces, as well belonging to themselves as to others attached to their\nparty.\n\nThe duke of Bourbon, on his arrival from this expedition at his town\nof Clermont, strengthened it, and all his other towns in that country,\nwith fortifications. When the garrisons had been properly posted,\nthe war suddenly broke out between the two parties of Armagnacs and\nBurgundians.\n\nThe duke of Burgundy had not been idle in fortifying his towns with\ngarrisons, and in collecting men at arms to resist his adversaries: he\nhimself was in Flanders making preparations to march an army to offer\nthem battle. The army of the Armagnacs had already made incursions into\nArtois, and had done much mischief to friend and foe, by carrying off\nprisoners and great plunder to the garrisons whence they had come. The\nBurgundians were not slow in making reprisals, and frequently invaded\nthe county of Clermont and other parts.\n\nWhen by chance the two parties met, the one shouted \u2018Orleans!\u2019 and\nthe other \u2018Burgundy!\u2019 and thus from this accursed war, carried on in\ndifferent parts, the country suffered great tribulation.\n\nThe duke of Burgundy, however, had the king on his side, and those also\nwho governed him: he resided in his h\u00f4tel of St Pol in Paris, and the\ngreater part of its inhabitants were likewise attached to the duke of\nBurgundy.\n\nAt that time, the governors of Paris were Waleran count de St Pol and\nJohn of Luxembourg[70], his nephew, who was very young, Enguerrand\nde Bournouville, and other captains. They frequently made sallies,\nwell accompanied by men at arms, on the Armagnacs, who at times even\nadvanced to the gates of Paris. They were particularly careful in\nguarding the person of the king, to prevent him from being seduced by\nthe Orleans-party, and carried out of the town.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XXXIII.\n\n    SIR CLUGNET DE BRABANT IS NEAR TAKING RETHEL.--HE OVERRUNS THE\n    COUNTRY OF BURGUNDY.--OTHER TRIBULATIONS ARE NOTICED.\n\n\nSir Clugnet de Brabant, who always styled himself admiral of France,\none day assembled two thousand combatants, or thereabout, whom he\nmarched as speedily as he could from their different garrisons, to the\ncountry of the Rethelois, having with them scaling ladders and other\nwarlike machines. They arrived at the ditches of the town of Rethel\nabout sun-rise, and instantly made a very sharp assault, thinking to\nsurprise the garrison and plunder the town. The inhabitants, however,\nhad received timely notice of their intentions, and had prepared\nthemselves for resistance as speedily as they could.--Nevertheless,\nthe assault lasted a considerable time with much vigour on both sides,\ninsomuch that many were killed and wounded of each party.\n\nAmong the latter was sir Clugnet de Brabant, who, judging from the\ndefence which was made, that he could not gain the place, ordered\nthe retreat to be sounded; and his men marched into the plain,\ncarrying with them the dead and wounded. He then divided them into two\ncompanies; the one of which marched through the country of the Laonnois\nto Coucy and Chauni, plundering what they could lay hands on, and\nmaking all prisoners whom they met on their retreat.\n\nThe other company marched through part of the empire, by the county of\nGuise, passing through the Cambresis, and driving before them, like\nthe others, all they could find, especially great numbers of cattle,\nand thus returned to the town of Ham sur Somme and to their different\ngarrisons.\n\nWhen they had reposed themselves for eight days, they again took the\nfield with six thousand combatants, and marched for the county of\nArtois. They came before the town of Bapaume, belonging to the duke of\nBurgundy, and, on their arrival, won the barriers, and advanced to the\ngates, where there was a severe skirmish. But the lord de Heilly, sir\nHugh de Busse, the lord d\u2019Ancuelles and other valiant men at arms, who\nhad been stationed there by the duke of Burgundy, made a sally, and\ndrove them beyond the barriers,--when many gallant deeds were done,\nand several killed and wounded on both sides; but the Burgundians were\nforced to retire within the town, for their enemies were too numerous\nfor them to attempt any effectual resistance. The Orleans-party now\nretreated, and collected much plunder in the adjacent country, which\nthey carried with them to their town of Ham.\n\nDuring this time, sir James de Chastillon[71], and the other\nambassadors from the king of France, negotiated a truce at Leulinghen,\nin the Boulonois, with the english ambassadors, to last for one year on\nsea and land.\n\nWhile these things were passing, the duke of Berry came with the queen\nof France from Melun to Corbeil, and thence sent Louis of Bavaria to\nthe duke of Acquitaine in Paris, and to those who governed the king,\nand also to the butchers, to request that they would be pleased to\nallow him to attend the queen to Paris, and to reside in his h\u00f4tel of\nNeele, near to the king his nephew, since he was determined no way to\ninterfere in the war between the dukes of Orleans and Burgundy.\n\nBut his request was refused, chiefly owing to the butchers of Paris,\nand others of the commonalty, who had great weight; and that he might\ngive over all thoughts of coming, they broke every door and window of\nhis h\u00f4tel de Neele, and committed other great damages. They sent back\nthe queen\u2019s brother with a message to her, to come and reside with her\nlord at Paris, without delay, but not to bring the duke of Berry with\nher.\n\nThe Parisians, fearful that the king and the duke of Acquitaine might\nbe carried off from the h\u00f4tel of St Pol, made them reside at the\nLouvre, where they kept constant guard day and night, to prevent any\nattempts of the Orleans-party to carry them away.\n\nThe queen, on receiving the message by her brother from the Parisians,\nand suspecting the consequences of their commotions, set out from\nCorbeil, and returned to Melun with him and the duke of Berry. A few\ndays after, the Parisians took up arms, marched in a large body to\nCorbeil, took the town, and placed a garrison therein. They then broke\ndown all the bridges over the Seine, between Charenton and Melun, that\nthe Armagnacs might not pass the river and enter the island of France.\n\nWhile the queen and the duke of Berry were at Melun, with the count\nWaleran de St Pol, whom the marshal Boucicaut had sent thither, the\nmaster of the cross-bows and the grand master of the household came to\nthem with few attendants. The duke of Bourbon and the count d\u2019Alen\u00e7on,\non their road from the Vermandois and Beauvoisis, to join the duke of\nOrleans, who was assembling his troops in the G\u00e2tinois, called on the\nqueen and the duke of Berry, to require their aid and support against\nthe duke of Burgundy, which was not granted,--because the king in\nfull council, presided by the duke of Acquitaine, had just published\nan edict in very strong terms, and had caused it to be sent to all the\nbailiwicks and seneschalships of the kingdom, ordering all nobles, and\nothers that were accustomed to bear arms, to make themselves ready to\nserve the king, in company with John duke of Burgundy, and to aid him\nin driving out of his realm all traitorous and disobedient subjects,\ncommanding them to obey the duke of Burgundy the same as himself,\nand ordering all towns and passes to be opened to him, and to supply\nhim with every necessary provision and store, the same as if he were\nthere in person. On this proclamation being issued, very many made\npreparations to serve under the duke of Burgundy with all diligence.\nIn addition, the duke of Acquitaine wrote the duke letters in his own\nhand, by which he ordered all the men at arms dependant on the crown to\nserve personally against his cousin-german, the duke of Orleans, and\nhis allies, who, as he said, were wasting the kingdom in many different\nparts, desiring him to advance as speedily as he could toward Senlis\nand the island of France.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XXXIV.\n\n    THE DUKE OF BURGUNDY ASSEMBLES A LARGE ARMY TO LAY SIEGE TO THE\n    TOWN OF HAM, AND LEADS THITHER HIS FLEMINGS.\n\n\nThe duke of Burgundy, being now assured that the duke of Orleans and\nhis allies were raising a large force to invade his countries, and that\nthey had already placed garrisons in towns and fortresses belonging\nto him or his allies, whence they had made frequent inroads to the\ndespoiling of his country, was highly discontented. To oppose them, he\nhad sent his summons to all his territories in Burgundy, Artois and\nFlanders, and elsewhere, for all nobles, and others accustomed to bear\narms in his behalf, to prepare themselves to join him with all speed,\nwell accoutred and armed, in obedience to the king\u2019s commands, and to\noppose his and the king\u2019s enemies.\n\nHe also solicited the assistance of his good towns in Flanders, and\nrequested that they would powerfully exert themselves in his favour,\nto which they readily and liberally assented. They raised a body of\nforty or fifty thousand combatants, well armed and provided with\nstaves according to the custom of the country. They had twelve thousand\ncarriages, as well carts as cars, to convey their armour, baggage and\nartillery, and a number of very large cross-bows, called ribaudequins,\nplaced on two wheels, each having a horse to draw it. They had also\nmachines for the attack of towns, behind which were long iron spits, to\nbe used toward the close of a battle,--and on each of them was mounted\none or two pieces of artillery.\n\nThe duke of Burgundy had also summoned to his assistance the duke of\nBrabant, his brother, who attended him with a handsome company; as\ndid likewise a valiant english knight, named sir William Baldock,\nlieutenant of Calais, with about three hundred english combatants.\n\nTheir places of rendezvous were at the towns of Douay and Arras, and\nthe adjacent country. The duke of Burgundy, on quitting Douay with his\nbrother of Brabant and great multitudes of men of rank, advanced to\nSluys, belonging to the count de la Marche, where he lodged. On the\nmorrow, the first day of September, he marched away early, and fixed\nhis quarters on the plain near to Marcouin, where he had his tents\nand pavilions pitched, and waited there two days for the arrival of\nhis whole army, and particularly for his Flemings, who came in grand\nparade, and drew up to their quarters in handsome array.--So numerous\nwere their tents that their encampments looked like large towns; and\nin truth, when all were assembled, they amounted to sixty thousand\nfighting men, without including the varlets, and such like, who were\nnumberless,--and the whole country resounded with the noises they made.\n\nWith regard to the Flemings, they thought that no towns or fortresses\ncould withstand them; and the duke of Burgundy was obliged, on their\nsetting off, to abandon to them whatever they might conquer; and when\nthey went from one quarter to another, they were commonly all fully\narmed, and in companies, according to the different towns and the\ncustom of Flanders,--and even when they marched on foot, the greater\npart wore leg-armour.\n\nAs to their mode of marching through a country, whatever they could\nlay hands on was seized, and, if portable, thrown into their carts;\nand they were so proud, on account of their great numbers, that they\npaid not any attention to noble men, however high their rank; and when\nthe army was to be quartered, or when they were on a foraging party,\nthey rudely drove away other men at arms, especially if they were not\ntheir countrymen, taking from them whatever provision they might have\ncollected, or any thing else that pleased them. This conduct created\ngreat disturbances and quarrels, more especially among the Picards, who\nwould not patiently endure their rudeness, insomuch that the duke of\nBurgundy and his captains had great difficulty in keeping any kind of\npeace between them.\n\nThe duke, after waiting some days for the whole of his army, saw it\narrive; and then he marched off triumphantly, and in handsome array,\nand fixed his quarters on the river Scheldt, near to the town of\nMarcouin.\n\nOn the morrow, he advanced to Mouchi la Garhe, between Peronne and Ham,\nand halted there. At this place, a Fleming was hanged for stealing a\nchalice and other valuables from a church. He thence marched toward the\ntown of Ham sur Somme, where his enemies were.\n\nOn his approach to the town of Athies, belonging to the count de\nDammartin, one of his adversaries, the inhabitants were so terrified\nthat they came out in a body to present him with the keys of the gates,\non the condition of being secured from pillage. The duke liberally\ngranted their request, seeing they had thus humbled themselves before\nhim of their own free will, and gave them a sufficient force to guard\ntheir town from being any way molested.----The duke then advanced with\nhis army near to Ham, but sent forward some of his best light troops\nto observe the countenance of the enemy. The Orleans-party sallied\nout against them, and a sharp skirmish took place; but they were\ncompelled, by the superior number of the Burgundians, to retire within\nthe town. The next day he marched his whole army before the place in\nbattle-array, and had his tents pitched on an eminence in front of one\nof the gates, and about the distance of a cannon shot. The Flemings\nwere likewise encamped according to the orders of their marshals\nand leaders, during which the garrison made some sallies, but were\nrepulsed, in spite of their valour, by superior numbers, and many were\nkilled and wounded on each side.\n\nWhen the duke had surrounded this town on one side only, he ordered\nbattering machines to be placed against the gate and wall, to demolish\nthem; and the Flemings pointed their ribaudequins, and shot from them\nso continually, day and night, that the enemy were greatly annoyed.\nBreaches were made in the wall and gate within a few days; but though\nthe garrison was much harrassed, they repaired both in the best manner\nthey could, with wood and dung.\n\nAt length, the besiegers fixed on a day for a general attack on the\ngate, intending to force an entry: the engagement continued very sharp\nfor three hours, but the garrison defended themselves so valiantly,\nwounding and slaying so many of the assailants, that they were forced\nto retreat. This happened on a Thursday; and on the Friday, the duke\nof Burgundy, I know not for what reason, had it proclaimed that no\none should, on any account, make an assault on the town, but that all\nshould labour in forming bridges over the Somme, that a passage might\nbe obtained for the army, and that the place might be besieged on all\nsides,--but events turned out very far from his expectations.\n\nOn the Friday morning, the besieged were expecting that the attack\nwould be renewed; but hearing of the duke\u2019s intentions to cross the\nriver with his army and surround the town, they packed up all their\nvaluables and fled, leaving within the walls only poor people and\npeasants, who had retired thither for safety. Those persons not having\nability or inclination to defend themselves, the duke\u2019s army, headed\nby the Picards, entered the place without any danger. The Flemings,\nobserving this, rushed so impetuously to gain admittance that many\nwere squeezed to death. When they had entered, they instantly began to\nplunder all they could lay hands on, according to the liberty which\ntheir lord the duke had granted them; for, as I have said, he had been\nnecessitated so to do before they would march from home. Part placed\nthemselves on one side of the street, leading to the gate which they\nhad entered, and part on the other; and when the Picards, or others\nnot of their country, were returning, they stopped and robbed them of\nall they had: they spared no man, noble or otherwise; and in this riot\nseveral were killed and wounded.\n\nThey entered a monastery of the town, and took away all they could\nfind, and carried to their tents many of both sexes, and children;\nand, on the morrow, having seized all they had, they set fire to\nseveral parts of the town,--and, to conclude all, the churches and\nhouses, with many of the inhabitants, were burnt, as well as a great\nquantity of cattle that had been driven thither as to a place of\nsecurity.\n\nNotwithstanding this cruel conduct of the Flemings, six or seven of the\nmonks escaped from the monastery, by the assistance of some noblemen,\nparticularly the prior, who most reverently held in his hands a cross,\nand were conducted to the tents of the duke of Burgundy, where they\nwere in safety.\n\nSuch was the conduct of the Flemings at the commencement of this war.\nThere were many towns beyond the Somme that belonged to the duke of\nOrleans and his allies, who, hearing of what had passed at Ham, were,\nas it may be readily believed, in the utmost fear and alarm; and there\nwere few people desirous of waiting their coming, lest they should be\nbesieged in some fortress, and suffer a similar fate,--for sir Clugnet\nde Brabant and sir Manessier Guieret, as I have said, had already\nabandoned Ham, which was well supplied with stores and provision, and\nhad retreated to Chauni and to Coucy.\n\nThe inhabitants of the town of Neelle, belonging to the count de\nDammartin, seeing the smoke of Ham, were greatly perplexed, for their\ngarrison had fled; but they, following the example of the town of\nAthies, waited on the duke of Burgundy, and, with many lamentations,\npresented him with the keys of their town, offering to submit\nthemselves to his mercy. The duke received them into favour, in the\nname of the king and his own, on their swearing not to admit any\ngarrison, and to be in future true and loyal subjects to the king,\ntheir sovereign lord.\n\nThis oath they willingly took; and, having thanked the duke for his\nmercy, they returned to their town, and by his orders demolished some\nof their gates and many parts of their walls. They also made their\nmagistrates and principal inhabitants swear to the observance of the\ntreaty which they had made, and for this time they remained in peace.\n\nIn like manner, those of the town of Roye, that were but lately become\nsubjects to the king, sent deputies to the duke, at his camp before\nHam, to say, that the Orleans party had treacherously entered their\ntown, and had done them much mischief, but that they had departed on\nhearing of his march, and requesting he would not be displeased with\nthem, as they were ready to receive him, and act according to his\npleasure. The duke told them, he should be satisfied if they would\npromise, on their oaths, never to admit again within their walls any of\nhis adversaries of the Orleans-party. Having obtained this answer, they\nreturned joyous to their town.\n\nThe duke now passed the Somme with his army at Ham, leaving that town\ncompletely ruined, and marched toward Chauni on the Oise, belonging to\nthe duke of Orleans; but the garrison, hearing of it, quitted the place\nin haste. The townsmen, greatly alarmed, sent, without delay, to offer\nhim their keys, and humbly supplicated his mercy, saying that their\nlord\u2019s men at arms had fled on hearing of his approach, from the fear\nthey had of him. The duke received them kindly, and took their oaths,\nthat they would henceforth loyally obey the king their sovereign lord,\nand himself, and would admit a garrison of his men to defend the town.\n\nAfter the conclusion of this treaty, the duke advanced to Roye, in the\nVermandois, and was lodged in the town, having quartered his army\nin the country round it. He dispatched thence sir Peter des Essars,\nknight, and his confidential adviser, to the king of France, to his\nson-in-law the duke of Acquitaine, and to the citizens of Paris, to\nmake them acquainted with the strength of his army, and with his\nsuccesses. Sir Peter des Essars was honourably received by the duke\nof Acquitaine and the Parisians; and in compliment to the duke of\nBurgundy, he was reinstated in his office of provost, in the room of\nsir Brunelet de Sainct Cler, who, by the royal authority, was appointed\nbailiff of Senlis, on the dismission of sir Gastelius du Bost, who was\nsuspected of being a favourer of the Orleans-party.\n\nWhen sir Peter des Essars had finished the business he had been sent\non to Paris, he set out for Rethel to announce to the count de Nevers,\nwho had assembled a considerable force, the march of the duke, and to\ndesire him to advance to the town of Mondidier, where he would have\nmore certain intelligence of his brother. The count de Nevers, on\nhearing this, used all diligence to assemble his men, and set off to\njoin the duke.\n\nDuring these transactions, the duke of Orleans, the count d\u2019Armagnac,\nthe constable of France, the master of the cross-bows, with a large\nbody of men at arms and others, came to the town of Melun, where the\nqueen of France and the duke of Berry resided. Having held a conference\nwith the queen and duke, they advanced to La Fert\u00e8 on the Marne, which\nbelonged to sir Robert de Bar[72], in right of his wife the viscountess\nde Meaux. They crossed the Marne, and came to Arsy en Mussien, in the\ncounty of Valois, dependant on the duke of Orleans, where his brother,\nthe count de Vertus, met him.\n\nThe count was accompanied by a numerous body of combatants, among whom\nwere the duke of Bourbon, John son to the duke of Bar, sir William de\nCoucy, Am\u00e9 de Sallebruche, sir Hugh de Hufalize, with others from the\nArdennes, Lorraine and Germany, who, in the whole, amounted to full six\nthousand knights and esquires, not including armed infantry and bowmen;\nand this party was henceforward popularly called _Armagnacs_, as I have\nbefore observed. Each bore on his armour badges similar to those which\nthey had formerly worn when they lay before Paris.\n\nThe duke of Orleans marched this army from the Valois, passing by\nSenlis, toward his county of Beaumont; but Enguerrand de Bournouville,\nwho had been posted in Senlis with a large force of men at arms to\nguard it, sallied out on their rear, and made a good booty of their\nbaggage as well as prisoners. In doing this, however, he lost some of\nhis men, who were slain or taken, and he then returned to Senlis. The\nduke of Orleans, with the other princes, were lodged in the castle of\nBeaumont, and his army in the country surrounding it.\n\nThe count de Nevers was prevented from joining his brothers as he\nintended,--for the Armagnacs, being the strongest, constrained him to\nconduct his army to Paris.\n\nThe duke of Burgundy was already arrived at Mondidier with his whole\narmy, and was making preparations to combat his enemies, should they\nbe so inclined, or to attack any town to which they should retire,\naccording to his pleasure. But the Flemings were now desirous to return\nhome, and had demanded permission of the duke, saying, that they had\nserved the time required of them on their departure from Flanders.\n\nThe duke was much surprised and displeased at their conduct, but\nearnestly desired that they would stay with him for only eight days\nlonger, as he had received intelligence that his enemies were near at\nhand, with a great army, ready to offer him battle, and that they could\nnever serve him more effectually. At this moment, the greater part of\ntheir officers waited on the duke to take leave of him, who, hearing\nthe earnest and affectionate manner in which he made so trifling a\nrequest, resolved to go back to their men and inform them of it, and\npromised to do every thing in their power in order that it should be\ncomplied with.\n\nOn their return to the tent of Ghent, where all their councils were\nheld, they assembled the leaders of the commonalty, and told them the\nrequest the duke their lord had made, namely, that they would stay with\nhim only eight days more, for that his adversaries were at hand with\na large army to offer him battle. This request having been stated,\nvarious were the opinions of the meeting: some were for staying, others\nnot, saying they had fulfilled the term required of them by their\nlord,--that winter was approaching, when, so numerous as they were,\nthey could not keep the field without great danger. Their opinions\nwere so discordant that no conclusion could be formed, to enable their\ncaptains to give any positive answer to the duke.\n\nThis council was held the 20th day of September, in the afternoon;\nand when it became dusk, these Flemings made very large fires in\ndifferent places, of the wood and timber of the houses which they\nhad pulled down and destroyed in Mondidier. They then began to load\ntheir baggage-waggons, and to arm themselves; and at midnight they all\nshouted from their quarters, in Flemish, _Vax, vax!_ which signifies,\n\u2018To arms, to arms!\u2019 and alarmed all the other parts of the army.\n\nThe duke of Burgundy was entirely ignorant of what they intended to do,\nand sent some flemish lords to know their intentions; but they would\nnot explain themselves to any one, and made answers contrary to the\nquestions asked. During this, the night passed away; and the moment day\nappeared, they harnessed their horses to the baggage-waggons, and set\nfire to all their lodgings, shouting, \u2018Gau, gau!\u2019 and departed, taking\nthe road to Flanders.\n\nThe attendants of the duke of Burgundy, hearing this cry and clamour,\nwent to inform him of it in his tent. Very much astonished thereat, he\ninstantly mounted his horse, and, accompanied by the duke of Brabant,\nrode after them. When he had overtaken them, with his head uncovered\nand his hands uplifted, he most humbly besought them to return,\nand stay with him four days only, calling them his most trusty and\nwell-beloved friends and companions, offering them great gifts, and\npromising to relieve the country of Flanders from taxes for ever, if\nthey would comply with his wishes.\n\nThe duke of Brabant also remonstrated with them on the advantages\noffered them by their lord, and, as he asked in return so very trifling\na favour, entreated them to pay due deference to his demand. But it was\nin vain: they turned a deaf ear to all that was said, and continued\ntheir march, only showing the written agreements they had made with\nthe duke, which were carried before them, and which they had fulfilled\non their part; but, as they were signed with his seal, he had not\nperformed his, in having them escorted beyond the river Somme to a\nplace of safety. Should he refuse to do this, they would send him his\nonly son, then at Ghent, cut into thousands of pieces.\n\nThe duke of Burgundy, noticing their rude manners, and perceiving that\nnothing was to be gained from them by fair means, began to appease them\nby ordering the trumpets to sound for decamping. This was not done\nwithout much loss,--for the duke, occupied solely with the attempt to\nmake the Flemings change their minds, had not ordered the tents to be\nstruck, nor the baggage loaded, so that the greater part of the tents\nwere burnt, with other things, from the fire of the houses caused\nby the Flemings on their departure. The flames spread from house to\nhouse, to the lodgings of the duke of Burgundy, who was troubled to the\nheart,--for he well knew that his adversaries were in high spirits, a\nshort day\u2019s march off, and he was anxious to give them battle; but from\nthis conduct of the Flemings his intentions would be frustrated,--and\nwhat was worse, he knew for certain, that the moment they should hear\nof it, they would publish that he had retreated, not daring to meet\nthem. He was, nevertheless, forced to submit to events which he could\nnot foresee nor prevent.\n\nThe Flemings had no sooner turned their faces homeward but they\nadvanced more in one day than in three before, and whatever they could\nlay hands on was pillaged and thrown into their baggage-carts: they\nhad, moreover, many quarrels with the Picards and English, and it often\nhappened that stragglers were wounded or put to death,--and when they\nwere superior in numbers, they failed not to retaliate.\n\nIt must be remembered, that this retreat took place in the month of\nSeptember, when the grapes in the vineyards were ripe; and they robbed\nevery vineyard they passed, devouring so many that numbers were found\ndead among the vines. On the other hand, they fed their horses and\ncattle so very abundantly on the immense pillage which they every where\nmade, that very many were bursten.\n\nThe duke of Burgundy, on his arrival at Peronne with his men at arms,\nwent personally to thank the Flemings, who were encamped on the river\nside, in the most humble manner for their services, and then had them\nescorted by his brother, the duke of Brabant, to Flanders, when every\nman returned to his home. The magistrates of the great towns were,\nhowever, very much displeased when they heard of their behaviour; but\nthey did not at the time notice it, for there were too many of them\nunder arms.\n\nThus did the Flemings retreat from Mondidier contrary to the will of\ntheir lord, the duke of Burgundy. On the same day, a knight of the\nparty of the duke of Orleans, called sir Peter de Quesnes, lord of\nGarois, at the head of full two hundred combatants, made an attack\non Mondidier, about four hours after they had marched away. He found\nthere many people, especially merchants, and inhabitants of the\nneighbourhood, whom he took prisoners: he slew many, and he and his men\nmade a very great booty.\n\nHe then returned to Clermont in Beauvoisis, whither the Armagnacs had\nmarched in pursuit of the count de Nevers. When they heard of this\nretreat of the duke of Burgundy and the Flemings, they held a council\nwhether or not they should follow them into their own country. It\nwas at length determined by the wisest to return toward Paris, and\nattempt to gain admittance by means of some connexions they had there,\nprincipally in order to have possession of the person of the king,\nwhich was their grand object.\n\nThey began their march, in consequence, towards Verberies, and crossed\nthe river Oise by a new bridge, which they erected, and thence advanced\nfor Paris. Those who had the guard of the king and the Parisians\nwere not well pleased to hear of their being so near, and made every\npreparation to oppose their entrance to Paris. The Armagnacs, finding\nit impossible to succeed, managed so well with the inhabitants of St\nDenis that they were there admitted; and the princes lodged in the\ntown, and the army in the adjacent fields and villages. From that\nsituation, they made a sharp war on the town of Paris, and on all those\nwho sided with the king and the duke of Burgundy.\n\nThey advanced daily from different parts to the very gates of\nParis,--when sallies were made against them, particularly by sir\nEnguerrand de Bournouville, who was one of the chiefs of the garrison\nunder the count Waleran de St Pol, the governor of the town. Severe\nskirmishes often took place, and many gallant deeds were done by the\nmen at arms of both sides.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XXXV.\n\n    THE DUKE OF BURGUNDY ASSEMBLES ANOTHER ARMY TO MARCH TO\n    PARIS.--EVENTS THAT HAPPENED DURING THAT TIME.\n\n\nWe will now return to the duke of Burgundy, who having, as I have said,\ndismissed his Flemings, under the escort of his brother the duke of\nBrabant, went from Peronne to Arras, where he met the earls of Pembroke\nand of Arundel, and sir William Baldock, who had accompanied him on his\nlate expedition. As these earls were lately come from England, he paid\nthem every respect, in compliment to the king of England who had sent\nthem. They had brought full twelve hundred combatants, as well horse as\nfoot, all men of courage.\n\nMuch intercourse took place at this time between the king of England\nand the duke of Burgundy, respecting a marriage between Henry prince of\nWales and one of the duke\u2019s daughters[73].--After he had magnificently\nfeasted these english captains in his town of Arras, and made them\nhandsome presents, he ordered them to march to Peronne, and hastily\nsummoned men at arms from all quarters to meet him personally at\nPeronne, where he had commanded the nobles of his estates to assemble.\n\nThe duke of Brabant did not meet him this time, being detained in the\ncounty of Luxembourg by affairs on behalf of his wife. The duke of\nBurgundy left Peronne with no more than six thousand combatants, and\nmarched to Roye,--thence, by Breteuil, to Beauvais, and from Beauvais,\nthrough Gisors, to Pontoise, where he halted for three weeks or\nthereabout. During this period, great numbers of men at arms came from\ndifferent countries to serve him.\n\nWhile these things were passing, it was ordered by the royal council,\nin the presence of the duke of Acquitaine, the count de Mortain,\nthe lord Gilles of Brittany, Waleran count de St Pol, governor of\nParis, the chancellor of France[74], the lord Charles de Savoisy,\nand other great nobles, that certain proclamations should be sent to\nall the bailiwicks and seneschalships of the kingdom, respecting the\nassembling of such large bodies of men at arms, daily done in defiance\nof the king\u2019s orders, by the duke of Orleans, his brothers, the duke\nof Bourbon, the counts d\u2019Alen\u00e7on and d\u2019Armagnac, and others of their\nparty, to the great mischief and tribulation of the kingdom at large,\nand highly displeasing to the king and disgraceful to his dignity.\n\nThis proclamation again prohibited any one from daring to join the\naforesaid nobles, or any of their party in arms, under pain of being\nreputed rebels and traitors to the king and his realm. It likewise\ncommanded all that had joined them to depart without delay, and return\npeaceably to their homes, without further living on or harrassing the\npeople, and ordered that no hindrance should be given to prevent this\nfrom being carried into effect. Such as should disobey these orders\nwould be most rigorously prosecuted without delay as rebels,--and from\nthat day forth no grace or favour would be shown them.\n\nThis proclamation was published in the usual places, and some few, but\nin no great number, privately quitted the party of the Armagnacs, and\nreturned to that of the king. Those that were disobedient, when taken\nby the royal officers, were in great danger of their lives. Several\nwere publicly executed; and among them a knight, called sir Binet\nd\u2019Espineuse, attached to the duke of Bourbon from being a native of\nthe county of Clermont, suffered at Paris. The cause of his death was\nhis having taken by force some flanders horses that were coming as a\npresent to the duke of Acquitaine from the duke of Burgundy. After he\nwas beheaded in the market-place, his body was suspended by the arms to\nthe gibbet at Montfaucon.\n\nThis punishment was inflicted by order of sir Peter des Essars, who, as\nhas been said, was lately re-established in his office of provost of\nParis, in the room of sir Brunelet de Sainct-Cler.\n\nThe duke of Orleans and his party were indignant at this execution, as\nwell as at the late royal proclamation; and the duke of Bourbon was\nparticularly angry at the disgraceful death of his knight.\n\nThus affairs went on from bad to worse. One day, the duke of Orleans\nfixed his quarters, with a large force, at the castle of St Ouen, which\nis a royal mansion, and thence made daily excursions to the gates of\nParis. He pressed the Parisians so hard that they were much straitened\nfor provisions; for they were not as yet accustomed to war, nor had\nthey provided any stores or assembled a force sufficient to repel the\nattacks of their adversaries.\n\nThe archbishop of Sens, brother to the late grand master Montagu, had\njoined the Armagnacs, but not in his pontifical robes; for instead\nof a mitre, he wore a helmet,--for a surplice, a coat of mail,--and\nfor a cope, a piece of steel,--for his croisier, a battle-axe. At this\nperiod, the duke of Orleans sent his heralds with letters to the king\nand the duke of Acquitaine, to inform them that the duke of Burgundy\nhad fled with his Flemings from Mondidier, not daring to wait his\nnearer approach. He took that opportunity of writing also to some\nof his friends in Paris, to know if through their means he could be\nadmitted into the town. It was lost labour, for those who governed for\nthe duke of Burgundy were too active and attentive in keeping the party\ntogether.\n\nBy some intrigues between those of the Orleans-party and one named\nColinet du Puiseur, who was governor for the king in the town of St\nCloud, this place was given up to them. The duke of Orleans instantly\nre-garrisoned it, and continually harrassed the Parisians; for now\nhe could at any time cross the Seine at the bridge of St Cloud, and\nattack both sides of Paris at once. Thus were the Parisians oppressed\non all sides by the Armagnacs,--on which account, another proclamation\nwas issued in the king\u2019s name throughout the realm, complaining of\nthe continued atrocious and rebellious acts, in spite of the positive\norders of the king to the contrary, committed by the duke of Orleans\nand his allies, to the great loss and destruction of his subjects\nand kingdom; that since such grievous complaints had been made on\nthe subject, and were continually made, he was resolved to have a\nstop put to such lawless proceedings. The king, therefore, with\nmature deliberation of council, now declares the aforesaid family of\nOrleans, and their allies, rebels, and traitors to himself and the\ncrown of France; and in order that henceforward no persons may dare\nto join them, he declares, all such to have forfeited their lives and\nestates, and by these presents gives power and authority to all his\nloyal subjects to arrest and imprison any of the aforesaid rebels, and\nto seize on their properties, moveable or immoveable, and to drive\nthem out of the kingdom, without let or hindrance from any of the\nking\u2019s officers. Given at Paris, the 3d day of October, 1411. Signed\nby the king, on the report from the great council specially called\nfor this purpose, at the h\u00f4tel de St Pol, when were present the duke\nof Acquitaine, the count de Mortain, the count de la Marche, Louis\nde Baviere, the lord Gilles of Brittany, the count de St Pol, the\nchancellor of France, with many other nobles of high rank.\n\nIn consequence of this proclamation, many of the captains and noblemen\nof the Armagnacs grew cold in their service, or delayed joining them\naccording to their former agreements; and fearing greater evils might\nbefal them by further incurring the indignation of the king, they\nwithdrew to the king\u2019s party, and excused themselves the best way they\ncould.\n\nWhile these affairs were going forward, the duke of Burgundy remained\nat Pontoise, as I have before said, and was there joined by numbers of\nmen at arms, as well vassals to the king as his own.\n\nDuring his stay at Pontoise, a man of a strong make entered his\napartment, with the intention to murder him, and had a knife hid in\nhis sleeve to accomplish his wicked purpose; but as he advanced to\nspeak with him, the duke, having no knowledge of his person, and always\nsuspicious of such attempts, placed a bench before him. Shortly after,\nsome of his attendants, perceiving his design, instantly arrested him,\nwhen, on confessing his intentions, he was beheaded in the town of\nPontoise.\n\nThe king, in order to strike more terror into the duke of Orleans\nand his allies, issued other proclamations throughout his kingdom.\nUnderneath is the tenour of the one which he sent to the bailiff of\nAmiens.\n\n\u2018Charles, by the grace of God, king of France, to the bailiff of\nAmiens, or to his lieutenant, sends health.\n\n\u2018It has lately come to our knowledge, by informations laid before\nour council, that John, our uncle of Berry, Charles our nephew, duke\nof Orleans, and his brothers, with John de Bourbon, John d\u2019Alen\u00e7on,\nCharles d\u2019Albreth, our cousin Bernard d\u2019Armagnac, in conjunction with\nothers, their aiders and abettors, moved by the wicked and damnable\ninstigations of their own minds, have for a long time plotted to depose\nand deprive us of our royal authority, and with their utmost power to\ndestroy our whole family, which God forbid! and to place another king\non the throne of France, which is most abominable to the hearing of\nevery heart in the breasts of our loyal subjects.\n\n\u2018We, therefore, by the mature deliberation of our council, do most\nsolemnly, in this public manner, divulge these abominable and\ntraitorous intentions of the aforesaid persons, and earnestly do call\nfor the assistance of all our loyal subjects, as well those bound to\nserve us by the tenure of their fiefs as the inhabitants of all our\ntowns, who have been accustomed to bear arms, to guard and defend our\nrights and lives against the traitors aforesaid, who have now too\nnearly approached our person, inasmuch as they have entered by force\nour town of St Denis, which contains not only many holy relics of the\nsaints but the sacred bodies of saints, our crown and royal standard,\nknown by the name of the Oriflamme, with several other precious and\nrare jewels.\n\n\u2018They have also gained forcible possession of the bridge of St Cloud,\nand have invaded our rights, (not to say any thing of our very dear\nand well-beloved cousin, the duke of Burgundy, to whom they have sent\nletters of defiance,) by setting fire to and despoiling our towns and\nvillages, robbing churches, ransoming or killing our people, forcing\nmarried women, and ravishing maidens, and committing every mischief\nwhich the bitterest enemy could do. We therefore do enjoin and command\nthee, under pain of incurring our heaviest displeasure, that thou\ninstantly cause this present ordinance to be proclaimed in the usual\nplaces in the town of Amiens, and in different parts within thy said\nbailiwick, so that no one may plead ignorance; and that thou do punish\ncorporally, and by confiscation of property, the aforesaid persons,\ntheir allies and confederates, whom thou mayest lay hands on, as guilty\nof the highest treason against our person and crown, that by so doing\nan example may be held forth to all others. We also command, under\nthe penalty aforesaid, all our vassals, and all those in general who\nare accustomed to carry arms, to repair to us as soon as possible. Be\ncareful to have the within ordinances strictly executed, so that we may\nnot have cause to be displeased with thee.\n\n\u2018Given at Paris, the 14th day of October, 1411, and in the 32d year of\nour reign.\u2019\n\nThis ordinance was signed by the king, on the report of his council,\nand thus dispatched to Amiens and other good towns, where it was\nproclaimed in the usual places, and with such effect on the vassals and\nloyal subjects of the king that they hastened in prodigious numbers to\nserve him.\n\nOn the other hand, very many of those who were of the Orleans-party\nwere arrested in divers parts of the realm,--some of whom were\nexecuted, and others confined in prison, or ransomed, as if they had\nbeen public enemies. It was pitiful to hear the many and grievous\ncomplaints which were made by the people of their sufferings, more\nespecially by those in the neighbourhood of Paris and in the isle of\nFrance.\n\nI must not forget, among other circumstances, to relate, that the\nParisians, to the amount of three thousand, as well those of the\ngarrison as others, sallied out of Paris, and went to the palace of\nWinchester (Bic\u00eatre), a very handsome mansion of the duke of Berry,\nwhere, from hatred to the duke, they destroyed and plundered the whole,\nleaving the walls only standing.--When they had done this, they went\nand destroyed another house, where the duke kept his horses, situated\non the river Seine, not far from the h\u00f4tel de Neelle.\n\nThe duke was much enraged when he was told of the insult and mischief\nthat had been done to him, and said aloud, that a time would come when\nthese Parisians should pay dearly for it.\n\nAffairs daily grew worse; and at length, the duke of Berry, the duke of\nOrleans and his brothers, the duke of Bourbon, the counts d\u2019Alen\u00e7on and\nd\u2019Armagnac, the lord d\u2019Albreth, were personally banished the realm by\nthe king, with all their adherents, of whatever rank they might be, by\nsound of trumpet in all the squares of Paris, and forbidden to remain\nor set foot within it until they should be recalled.\n\nThey were not only banished the kingdom of France, but, by virtue of\na bull of pope Urban V. of happy memory, (preserved in the Tr\u00e9sor des\nChartres of the king\u2019s privileges in the holy chapel at Paris), they\nwere publicly excommunicated and anathematised in all the churches of\nthe city of Paris, by bell, book, and candle. Many of their party were\nmuch troubled at these sentences, but, nevertheless, continued the same\nconduct, and made a more bitter war than before.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XXXVI.\n\n    THE DUKE OF BURGUNDY MARCHES A LARGE ARMY FROM PONTOISE TO\n    PARIS, THROUGH MELUN.--THE SITUATION AND CONDUCT OF THE DUKE OF\n    ORLEANS.\n\n\nI have mentioned, that during the stay of the duke of Burgundy at\nPontoise, he received great reinforcements of men at arms from all\nparts: among others, the count de Penthievre, his son-in-law, joined\nhim with a noble company. Having remained there for about fifteen days,\nand made diligent inquiry into the state of his adversaries, on the 22d\nday of October, he marched his whole army thence about two o\u2019clock in\nthe afternoon. As the royal road from that place to Paris was occupied\nby the enemy, he quitted it for that through Melun sur Seine, where\nhe crossed the river with full fifteen thousand horse, and, marching\nall night, arrived on the morrow morning at the gate of St Jacques at\nParis. Great multitudes went out of the town to meet him; among whom\nwere the butchers of Paris, well armed and arrayed, conducted by the\nprovosts of the Ch\u00e2telet and of the merchants, under the command of the\ncount de Nevers, brother to the duke of Burgundy, who was attended by\nseveral princes, noble lords and captains: even the great council of\nstate went out upwards of a league to meet him, and to do him honour.\nIndeed, they all showed him as much deference and respect as they could\nhave done to the king of France, on his return from a long journey.\n\nWith regard to the people of Paris, they made great rejoicings on his\narrival, and sang carols in all the streets through which he passed;\nand because his entry was made late in the day, and it was dusk, the\nstreets were illuminated with great quantities of torches, bonfires and\nlanthorns.\n\nOn his approach to the Louvre, the duke of Acquitaine, who had married\nhis daughter, advanced to meet him, and received him with joy and\nrespect. He led him into the Louvre, and presented him to the king and\nqueen, who received him most graciously.\n\nHaving paid his due respects, he withdrew, and went to lodge at\nthe h\u00f4tel de Bourbon. The earl of Arundel was quartered, with his\nattendants, at the priory of St Martin des Champs, and his Englishmen\nnear to him in the adjoining houses. The rest quartered themselves as\nwell as they could in the city.\n\nOn the morrow, which was a Sunday, Enguerrand de Bournouville, with\nmany valiant men at arms and archers, as well Picards as English, made\na sally as far as La Chapelle, which the Armagnacs had fortified, and\nquartered themselves within it. On seeing their adversaries advancing,\nthey mounted their horses, and a sharp skirmish ensued, in which\nmany were unhorsed. Among those who behaved well, sir Enguerrand was\npre-eminent. Near his side was John of Luxembourg, nephew to the count\nde St Pol, but very young. Many were wounded, but few killed. The\nEnglish, with their bows and arrows, were very active in this affair.\n\nWhile this action was fought, the Armagnacs quartered at St Denis,\nMontmartre, and other villages, hearing the bustle, mounted their\nhorses, and hastened to cut off the retreat of Enguerrand. He was\ninformed of this in time, and, collecting his men, retreated toward\nParis; but as the enemy were superior in numbers, they pressed hard on\nhis rear, and killed and made prisoners several of his men.\n\nThe duke of Orleans and the princes of his party, on hearing of the\narrival of the duke of Burgundy with so large an army in Paris, ordered\ntheir men at arms, and others that were lodged in the villages round,\nto unite and quarter themselves at St Denis. To provide forage, sir\nClugnet de Brabant was sent with a body of men at arms into the Valois\nand Soissonois, where there was abundance. Sir Clugnet acquitted\nhimself well of his command, and brought a sufficient quantity to\nSt Denis; for at this time there was great plenty of corn and other\nprovision in France.\n\nThe Armagnacs were, therefore, well supplied; and as they were the\nstrongest on that side of Paris, they daily made excursions of\ndifferent parties as far as the rivers Marne and Oise, and throughout\nthe isle of France. In like manner, the army of the king and the duke\nof Burgundy scoured the country on the other side of the Seine, as far\nas Montlehery, Meulan and Corbeil; and thus was the noble kingdom of\nFrance torn to pieces.\n\nThere were frequent and severe rencounters between the men at arms of\neach side; and a continued skirmish was going forward between those in\nParis and in St Denis, when the honour of the day was alternately won.\n\nAmong other places where these skirmishes took place was a mill,\nsituated on an eminence, and of some strength. In this mill, two or\nthree hundred of the Orleans-party sometimes posted themselves, when\nthe Parisians and Burgundians made an attack on them, which lasted even\nuntil night forced them to retreat.--At other times, the Burgundians\nposted themselves in the mill, to wait for the assault of their\nadversaries.\n\nThe duke of Orleans had with him an english knight, called the lord de\nClifford, who had, some time before, joined him with one hundred men\nat arms and two hundred archers, from the country of the Bourdelois.\nHaving heard that the king of England had sent the earl of Arundel,\nwith several other lords, to the duke of Burgundy, he waited on the\nduke of Orleans to request that he would permit him to depart, for that\nhe was afraid his sovereign would be displeased with him should he\nremain any longer. The duke of Orleans having for a while considered\nhis request granted it, but on condition that neither he himself nor\nhis men should bear arms against him during the war. The knight made\nhim this promise, and then returned to England.\n\nOn the 6th day of November, Troullart de Moncaurel, governor and\nbailiff of Senlis, having marched about six score combatants of his\ngarrison to the country of Valois, was met by seven score of the\nArmagnacs, who vigorously attacked him; but, after many gallant deeds\nwere done, Troullart remained victorious. From sixty to eighty of the\nArmagnacs were taken or slain; and among the prisoners was sir William\nde Saveuse, who had followed the Orleans-party, when his two brothers,\nHector and Philip, were in arms with the duke of Burgundy. Thus, in\nthis abominable warfare, were brothers engaged against brothers, and\nsons against fathers. After this defeat, Troullart de Moncaurel and\nPeter Quieriet, who had accompanied him, returned with their booty\nto Senlis, when, shortly after, by the exertions of the old lord de\nSaveuse and the two brothers, Hector and Philip, sir William obtained\nhis liberty.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XXXVII.\n\n    THE DUKE OF BURGUNDY LEADS A GREAT FORCE, WITH THE PARISIANS,\n    TO ST CLOUD, AGAINST THE ARMAGNACS.\n\n\nThe duke of Burgundy having remained some time at Paris with his army,\nand having held many councils with the princes and captains who were\nthere, marched out of the town about midnight, on the 9th of November,\nby the gate of St Jacques. He was magnificently accompanied by men at\narms and Parisians, among whom were the counts de Nevers, de la Marche,\nde Vaudemont, de Penthievre, de St Pol, the earl of Arundel, Boucicaut\nmarshal of France, the lord de Vergy marshal of Burgundy, the lord de\nHeilly, lately appointed marshal of Acquitaine, the lord de St George,\nsir John de Croy, Enguerrand de Bournouville, the lord de Fosseux, sir\nRegnier Pot governor of Dauphiny, the seneschal of Hainault sir John de\nGuistelle, the lord de Brimeu, the earl of Kent, an Englishman, with\nmany other nobles, as well from Burgundy as from Picardy and different\ncountries. They were estimated by good judges at six thousand\ncombatants, all accustomed to war, and four thousand infantry from the\ntown of Paris.\n\nWhen they had passed the suburbs, they advanced in good array, under\nthe direction of trusty guides, to within half a league of Saint Cloud,\nwhere the Armagnacs were quartered. It might be about eight o\u2019clock in\nthe morning when they came thither, and the weather was very cold and\nfrosty. Being thus arrived without the enemy knowing of it, the duke of\nBurgundy sent the marshal of Burgundy, sir Gaultier des Ruppes, sir Guy\nde la Trimouille, and le veau de Bar, with eight hundred men at arms,\nand four hundred archers, across the Seine, toward St Denis, to prevent\nthe enemy from there crossing the river by a new bridge which they had\nerected over it. These lords so well executed the above orders that\nthey broke down part of the bridge, and defended the passage.\n\nThe duke, in the mean time, ascended the hill of St Cloud in order of\nbattle, and at the spot where four roads met posted the seneschal of\nHainault, sir John de Guistelle, the lord de Brimeu, John Phillips and\nJohn Potter[75], english captains, at one of them, with about four\nhundred knights and esquires, and as many archers. At another road, he\nstationed the lords de Heilly and de Ront, Enguerrand de Bournouville,\nand Aym\u00e9 de Vitry, with as many men as the knights above-mentioned. The\nthird road was guarded by Neville earl of Kent[76], with some picard\ncaptains; and the Parisians and others, to a great amount, were ordered\nto Sevres, to defend that road.\n\nWhen these four divisions had arrived at their posts, they made\ntogether a general assault on the town of St Cloud, which the Armagnacs\nhad fortified with ditches and barriers to the utmost of their power.\nAt these barriers, a notable defence was made by those who had heard of\nthe arrival of the enemy, under the command of their captains, namely,\nsir James de Plachiel, governor of Angoul\u00eame, the lord de Cambour,\nWilliam Batillier, sir Mansart du Bos, the bastard Jacob, knight, and\nthree other knights from Gascony, who fought bravely for some time; but\nthe superiority of numbers, who attacked them vigorously on all sides,\nforced them to retreat from their outworks, when they were pursued,\nfighting, however, as they retreated, to the tower of the bridge and\nthe church, which had been fortified.\n\nThe whole of the burgundian force which had been ordered on this duty,\nexcepting the party who guarded the passage of the bridge, now bent all\ntheir efforts against the church. The attack was there renewed with\ngreater vigour than before, and, notwithstanding the gallant defence\nthat was made, the church was stormed, and many were slain in the\nchurch as well as at the barriers. Numbers also were drowned of the\ncrowd that was pressing to re-enter the tower of the bridge, by the\ndrawbridge breaking under their weight.\n\nIt was judged by those well acquainted with the loss of the Armagnacs,\nthat including the drowned, there were nine hundred killed and five\nhundred prisoners. Among these last were sir Mansart du Bos, the lord\nde Cambour, and William Batillier. In the town of St Cloud were found\nfrom twelve to sixteen hundred horses that had been gained by plunder,\nand a variety of other things.\n\nWhile this was passing, the duke of Burgundy was with the main army\ndrawn up in battle-array, on a plain above the town: he had with him\nthe greater part of the princes, and his spies were every where on the\nlook-out that the enemy might not surprise him by any unexpected attack.\n\nThe engagement at the tower of the bridge was still continued by the\nBurgundians, in the hope of taking it; but it was labour in vain, for\nthose within defended it manfully.\n\nSome of the garrison sallied out on the opposite side, and hastened\nto St Denis, to inform the duke of Orleans of the disaster that had\nbefallen them. He was sorely displeased thereat, and instantly mounted\nhis horse, accompanied by the duke of Bourbon, the counts d\u2019Alen\u00e7on\nand d\u2019Armagnac, the constable, the master of the cross-bows, the young\nBoucicaut, and about two thousand combatants, advanced toward St Cloud,\nand drew up in battle-array on the side of the river Seine, opposite to\nwhere the duke of Burgundy was posted, and made every preparation as\nif for an immediate combat. The duke of Burgundy and his men likewise\ndismounted, drew up in order of battle, and displayed his banner, which\nwas most rich and splendid. But notwithstanding the eager desire which\nthese princes showed for the combat, it was to no purpose,--for the\nriver was between them, so that no damage could accrue to either party,\nexcepting by some chance bolts from the cross-bows, who shot at random.\n\nWhen the Armagnacs had remained there for some time, seeing that\nnothing effectual could be done, they remounted their horses and\nreturned to St Denis, leaving, however, a reinforcement to defend the\ntower of St Cloud. On their departure, the duke of Burgundy held a\ncouncil, and it was determined to march the whole army back to Paris.\nThe duke lost this day, in slain, not more than from sixteen to twenty;\nbut there were many wounded, among whom were Enguerrand de Bournouville\nand Aym\u00e9 de Vitry, who had fought well, as did the lord of Heilly. In\nlike manner, the earl of Arundel and his men behaved gallantly; and it\nwas one of them who had made sir Mansart du Bos prisoner, but for a sum\nof money he resigned him to one of the king\u2019s officers.\n\nThe duke of Burgundy, on his return, was received by the Parisians with\ngreat acclamations; for they had heard of his brilliant success, and\nthey imagined that through his means they should shortly be delivered\nfrom their enemies, who oppressed them sorely. With regard to the king,\nthe duke of Acquitaine, and the members of the grand council, prelates\nas well as seculars, the reception which they gave him, the princes and\nthe captains of his army, is not to be described.\n\nThe duke of Orleans, learning that the duke of Burgundy had returned\nto Paris with his army, held a council with the heads of his party,\nwhen, having considered the severe loss they had suffered of the most\nexpert of their captains, and the great power and numbers of their\nopponents, whom they could not at this moment withstand with hopes of\nsuccess, they resolved to retire to their own countries, and collect a\nsufficient army to oppose any force the king and the duke of Burgundy\nshould bring against them. This was no sooner determined than executed;\nfor they instantly packed up their baggage, and, crossing the\nnewly-erected bridge over the Seine, which they had repaired, and the\nbridge of St Cloud, hastily marched all night toward Estampes, and then\ncontinued their route to Orleans, and to other towns and castles under\ntheir obedience.\n\nThus, therefore, the duke of Orleans, in seeking vengeance for the\ndeath of his father, gained only disgrace and great loss of men. Such\nof them as were slain in the field, at the battle of St Cloud, were\nthere inhumanly left without sepulture, as being excommunicated, a prey\nto dogs, birds, and wild beasts. Some lords of his party, such as sir\nClugnet de Brabant, sir Aym\u00e9 de Sarrebruche, the lord de Hufalize, and\nmany more, passed through the county of Valois to Champagne, and thence\nto their own homes.\n\nNews of this retreat was, very early on the morrow, carried to the\nduke of Burgundy and his captains at Paris. Some of them mounted their\nhorses, and went to St Denis, when all that the Armagnacs had left was\nseized on and pillaged: they even arrested and carried away, in the\nking\u2019s name, the abbot of St Denis, for having admitted his enemies\ninto that town. Many of the principal inhabitants were also fined,\nnotwithstanding the excuses they offered. Others of the duke\u2019s officers\nwent to the town of St Cloud, which they found abandoned.--Many pursued\nthe Armagnacs, but in vain; for they had marched all night, and were at\na considerable distance before the news of their decampment had reached\nParis.\n\nA few days after, the king, by the advice and entreaties of the duke\nof Burgundy, bought the greater part of the prisoners made at the late\nbattle, by paying their ransoms to those who had taken them. In the\nnumber was Colinet, thus surnamed by many, who had betrayed the bridge\nof St Cloud to the duke of Orleans; and on the 12th day of November, he\nand five of his accomplices were beheaded in the market-place at Paris:\nhis body was quartered, and the five others were hung up by the arms on\nthe gibbet at Montfaucon.\n\nOn the 13th of the same month, a sermon was preached in the\nchurch-square, before the porch of N\u00f4tre Dame in Paris, by a Friar\nMinor, in the presence of the duke of Burgundy, many princes, and a\ngreat concourse of people,--in which he said that the bulls given by\npope Urban V. had been of the utmost efficacy against the rebellious\nsubjects of the king, and publicly denounced the duke of Orleans and\nhis party as excommunicated. They were also thus denounced in many\nother succeeding sermons.\n\nThe ensuing day, the king heard mass in N\u00f4tre Dame, and returned to the\nLouvre to dinner, when he most graciously received the earl of Arundel,\nand caused him to be seated at his table next to the duke of Burgundy.\n\nMany councils were held at Paris respecting this war, and on the\nmeasures the king should now adopt. It was at length determined, that\non account of the winter, neither the king nor the princes should\nattempt any thing more until the ensuing summer, but only have some\nable captains with a sufficient force on the frontiers, to harrass\nand pursue the enemy, and keep him in check. In consequence, the lord\nBoucicaut marshal of France, the lord de Heilly marshal of Acquitaine,\nEnguerrand de Bournouville, Aym\u00e9 de Vitry, the lord de Miraumont and\nothers, were ordered on this service with a very considerable force.\nThey marched toward Estampes and Bonneval, and those parts, having with\nthem the lord de Ront.\n\nBonneval, on the first summons from the above captains, surrendered to\nthe king\u2019s obedience, and the greater part of them were lodged in the\ntown, and in an adjoining abbey of some strength. Those of Estampes\nrefused to surrender, for it was garrisoned by the duke of Berry, and\nbegan to make war on the troops of the king and the duke of Burgundy,\nby the instigation of the lord Louis de Bourbon, governor of Dourdan,\nwho resided there.\n\nAt this period, with the consent of the duke of Burgundy, sir John de\nCroy, eldest son to the lord de Croy, still detained prisoner by the\nduke of Orleans, marched from Paris, with eight hundred combatants, for\nthe castle of Monchas, in the county of Eu, in which were the duke of\nBourbon\u2019s children and his lady-duchess, namely, one son about three\nyears old, and a daughter by her first husband nine years old, with\ntheir nurses and other attendants. The son of sir Mansart du Bos, and\nthe lord de Foulleuses, knight, were also there. The castle and the\nwhole of its inhabitants were taken by sir John de Croy; and he carried\nthem, and all he found within it, to the castle of Renty, where he held\nthem prisoners, until his father, the lord de Croy, was released. When\nthis misfortune was told to the duke of Bourbon, he was much afflicted;\nbut the duchess took it so sensibly to heart that very soon after she\ndied of grief[77].\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XXXVIII.\n\n    THE KING OF FRANCE SENDS THE COUNT DE SAINT POL TO THE VALOIS,\n    AND TO COUCY, AND OTHER CAPTAINS TO DIFFERENT PARTS AGAINST THE\n    ARMAGNACS.\n\n\nConformable to the resolutions of the aforesaid council, count Waleran\nde St Pol was sent into the Valois, to reduce the whole of that country\nto the king\u2019s obedience, and then to march to Coucy with a large body\nof men at arms, archers, and cross-bows.\n\nSir Philip de Servolles, bailiff of Vitry en Pertois, was also ordered\ninto the country of Vertus, with a considerable force, to subdue the\nwhole of it. The vidame of Amiens was sent into the county of Clermont.\nFerry d\u2019Hangest, bailiff of Amiens, was ordered, for the above purpose,\ninto the counties of Boulogne, Eu, and Gamaches.\n\nThe inhabitants of Crespy, the principal town of the Valois, no sooner\nlearnt the intentions of the count de St Pol than they surrendered it\nto him, and received him handsomely. He thence advanced to the castle\nof Pierrefons, which was very strong, and well provided with all\nwarlike stores and provision. On coming before it, he held a parley\nwith the lord de Boquiaux the governor, who concluded a treaty with\nhim for its surrender, on condition that the count would pay him, in\nthe king\u2019s name, two thousand golden crowns for his expenses, and that\nthe garrison should carry away all they had with them. The lady of\nGaucourt, who was in the castle, retired to the castle of Coucy, where\nshe was honourably received by sir Robert d\u2019Esne, the governor.\n\nThe count de St Pol marched from Pierrefons to la Fert\u00e9-Milon, a very\nstrong castle, and to Villers-Cotter\u00eats, both belonging to the duke of\nOrleans; when not only these two but all the other places in Valois,\nhearing of the surrender of so strong a castle as Pierrefons without\nmaking any resistance, surrendered, and returned to their obedience to\nthe king. The Count placed good garrisons in each, and then marched\nfor Coucy, in the Soissonois, where, as I have before said, sir\nRobert d\u2019Esne was governor of the castle. He had with him Rigault des\nFontaines, and others attached to the party of the duke of Orleans.\nThe governor of the town of Coucy was sir Enguerrand des Fontaines,\nand within it were many noblemen, who, holding a council, resolved to\nsurrender the place, and to leave it with all their baggage.\n\nThe count quartered himself and his men at arms in the town and\nsuburbs, and then summoned sir Robert d\u2019Esne, in the king\u2019s name, to\nsurrender the castle. This sir Robert refused to do, saying, that the\nduke of Orleans had given him orders, when he appointed him governor,\nnever to surrender it without his consent or knowledge, and these\norders he had sworn to obey; that it was well provided with all kinds\nof stores, and plenty of provision, so that he did not fear its being\ntaken by force; and he hoped, that before he should be induced to\nyield it, means would be found to restore his lord and master to the\ngood graces of the king.----The count, on hearing this answer, ordered\nthe castle to be surrounded, and quartered his men as near to it as\npossible, keeping up at the same time a brisk cannonade. Among other\nexpedients, the count employed a body of miners, to undermine the gate\nof the lower court, called la Porte Maistre Odon, which was as handsome\nan edifice as could be seen for twenty leagues round; and he employed\ncompanies of miners to work at the other large towers, who were so\nsuccessful that, in a short time, the mines were ready to be set fire\nto.\n\nThe governor was again summoned to surrender, but again refused. Upon\nwhich, the count ordered his men under arms, to be prepared for the\nstorm should it be necessary; and when all was ready, fire was set to\nthe combustibles within the mines, so that when the supporters were\nburnt, the whole of the tower and gate fell flat down, but, fortunately\nfor the besieged, the inside wall remained entire, so that the\nbesiegers were not greatly benefited. Several were killed and wounded\non both sides by the fall of the towers: one of them at the corner was\nprevented from falling to the ground by the wall supporting it; and one\nof the men at arms remained on this inclined tower, where he had been\nposted to guard it, and was in great peril of his life, but was saved\nby the exertions of the garrison.\n\nAt length, when the count de St Pol had been before this castle of\nCoucy about three months, a treaty was entered into between him and sir\nRobert, that he would surrender the castle on condition that he and his\ngarrison should depart unmolested whither they pleased, with all they\ncould carry with them, and should receive, for their expenses, twelve\nhundred crowns, or thereabout. When this was concluded, the governor\nmarched off with about fifty combatants, the principal of whom were\nhis son, le Baudrain de Fur, knight, Rigault des Fontaines, before\nmentioned, and Gaucher de Baissu. The lady de Gaucourt departed also\nin their company. Sir Robert and the greater part of his men went and\nfixed their residence at Creve-coeur and in the castle of Cambresis.\n\nThe count de St Pol, on the surrender of the castle, appointed sir\nGerard de Herbannes governor, with a sufficient garrison. There were\nwith him on this expedition his nephew John of Luxembourg, the vidame\nof Amiens, the lord de Houcourt, and many other nobles and esquires\nfrom Picardy, especially such as were his vassals. Having finished\nthis business so successfully, he returned to the king at Paris, who,\nin consideration of his good qualities, and as a remuneration for his\nservices, nominated him constable of France. The sword of office was\ndelivered to him, and he took the usual oaths, in the room of the lord\nd\u2019Albreth, who had been dismissed therefrom, being judged unworthy to\nhold it any longer.\n\nIn like manner, the lord de Rambures was appointed master of the\ncross-bows of France, in the place of the lord de Hangest, who had been\ndismissed by the king. The lord de Longny, a native of Brittany, was\nmade marshal of France, on the resignation, and with the consent, of\nthe lord de Rieux[78], who was superannuated.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XXXIX.\n\n    SIR PHILIP DE SERVOLLES, BAILIFF OF VITRY, LAYS SIEGE TO THE\n    CASTLE OF MOYENNES.----OTHER PLACES ARE BY THE KING\u2019S OFFICERS\n    REDUCED TO HIS OBEDIENCE.\n\n\nIn regard to the county of Vertus, the moment sir Philip de Servolles\ncame before the town of that name, it surrendered to the king,--and in\nlike manner all the other places in that county, excepting the castle\nof Moyennes. In this castle were sir Clugnet de Brabant, his brother\nJohn of Brabant, sir Thomas de Lorsies, and many more, who would not on\nany account submit to the king.\n\nThe bailiff of Vitry consequently laid siege to it, and made every\npreparation to conquer it by force. It was, however, in vain; for the\ngarrison were well provided with provision, artillery and stores of all\nkinds, so that they little feared the besiegers, and very frequently\ncut off their detachments.\n\nThe siege lasted for upwards of three months; and at the end of this\ntime, sir Clugnet and sir Thomas de Lorsies, mounted on strong and\nactive coursers, followed by two pages, set out from the castle,--and,\ngalloping through the besieging army with their lances in their rests,\npassed safely, striking down all opposers, escaped to Luxembourg, and\nwent to sir Aym\u00e9 de Sarrebruche to seek for succour. But they did not\nreturn with any assistance; for a few days after, John of Brabant was\nmade prisoner in a sally from the castle, and, by order of the king and\ncouncil, beheaded in the town of Vitry. After this event, the remainder\nof the garrison surrendered themselves to the king\u2019s obedience, on\nstipulating with the bailiff that they were to have their lives and\nfortunes spared. He instantly new-garrisoned the castle.\n\nThus was that whole country reduced to the king\u2019s obedience; and that\nof Clermont followed the example, by surrendering to the vidame of\nAmiens without making any resistance. The garrisons in the different\ntowns and castles that had done great mischief to the surrounding\ncountry withdrew with all their baggage, under the protection of\npassports, to the Bourbonois, and were replaced by the king\u2019s troops.\n\nThe bailiff of Amiens was equally successful at Boulogne-sur-mer,\nwhich, with all the adjacent places, surrendered, excepting the castle\nof Boulogne,--the seneschal of which, by name sir Louis de Corail,\na native of Auvergne, would not yield it without the permission of\nhis lord, the duke of Berry, who had intrusted it to his guard. The\nbailiff, however, with his men, destroyed the drawbridge, and filled\nup the ditches, so that no one could enter or come out of the castle.\nA parley took place between the governor and bailiff, when the first\nwas allowed to send to his lord, the duke of Berry, to know if he would\nconsent that the castle should be given up to the king, and hold him\ndischarged for so doing.\n\nThe duke, in answer, bade him surrender the castle to the king\u2019s\nofficers, and come to him at Bourges, which was done. In like manner,\nall the places in the county of Eu, and in the territory of Gamaches,\nwere surrendered to the king; and the officers who had been placed in\nthem by their lords were dismissed, and others of the king\u2019s servants\nput in their room.\n\nDuring this time, very large sums of money were raised in Paris and\nelsewhere, to pay the english troops who had come to serve the duke\nof Burgundy by permission of the king of England. On receiving their\npayment, the earl of Arundel, with his men, returned to England by\nway of Calais; but the earl of Kent[79] and his troops remained in the\nservice of the duke of Burgundy.\n\nAt this moment, the Orleans-party were in great distress, and knew not\nwhere to save themselves; for the instant any of them were discovered,\nwhether secular or ecclesiastic, they were arrested and imprisoned, and\nsome executed,--others heavily fined. Two monks were arrested at this\ntime, namely, master Peter Fresnel, bishop of Noyon, who was taken by\nsir Anthony de Craon, and carried from Noyon to the castle of Crotoy;\nthe other, the abbot of Foresmoustier, was made prisoner by the lord\nde Dampierre, admiral of France. They were soon delivered on paying a\nlarge ransom, when each returned to his bishoprick and monastery.\n\nThe lord de Hangest, still calling himself grand master of the french\ncross-bows, being attached to the Orleans-party, had, after the retreat\nfrom St Denis, secretly retired to the castle of Soissons. Having a\ndesire to attempt regaining the king\u2019s favour, he sent a poursuivant\nto demand a safe conduct from Troullart de Moncaurel, bailiff and\ngovernor of Senlis, for him to come and reside in that town. The safe\nconduct was sent to him, and he came to Senlis; but, because there was\nno mention of his return in this permission, Troullart made him and\nfifteen other gentlemen prisoners in the king\u2019s name. Shortly after,\nthey were carried to the Ch\u00e2telet in Paris, to his great displeasure,\nbut he could not prevent it.\n\nThe count de Roussy also had retired, after the retreat from St Denis,\nto his castle of Pont \u00e1 Arsy sur Aine; but it was instantly surrounded\nby the peasants of the Laonnois, who increased to about fifteen\nhundred, and made most terrible assaults on the castle,--and, in spite\nof its deep moat and thick walls, they damaged it very much. These\npeasants called themselves the king\u2019s children. Sir Brun de Barins,\nknight, bailiff of the Vermandois, and the provost of Laon, came to\nassist and to command them,--when the count, perceiving the danger he\nwas in, to avoid falling into the hands of these peasants, surrendered\nhimself and his castle to the bailiff of the Vermandois, on condition\nthat his own life, and the lives of all within it, should be spared.\nThe bailiff accepted the terms, and, having re-garrisoned it with the\nking\u2019s troops, carried the count and his men prisoners to Laon, where\nthey remained a long time; but at length, on paying a heavy ransom,\nthey obtained their liberty.\n\nThe archdeacon of Brie was, in like manner, taken in the tower of\nAndely by these peasants. He was natural son to the king of Armenia.\nSir William de Coussy, who was of the Orleans-party, retired to his\nbrother in Lorraine, who was bishop of Metz.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XL.\n\n    THE DUKES OF ACQUITAINE AND BURGUNDY MARCH TO CONQUER ESTAMPES\n    AND DOURDAN.----THE EXECUTION OF SIR MANSART DU BOS AND OTHER\n    PRISONERS.\n\n\nDuring these tribulations, there were so many grievous complaints made\nto the king and the princes at Paris, of the mischiefs done to the\ncountry by the garrisons of Estampes and Dourdan, that notwithstanding\nit had been determined in council that neither the king nor the duke\nof Acquitaine should take the field until the winter should be passed,\nthis resolution was overruled by circumstances.\n\nOn the 23d day of November, the duke of Acquitaine, accompanied by the\nduke of Burgundy, the counts of Nevers, de la Marche, de Penthievre,\nde Vaudemont, and the marshal de Boucicaut, with others of rank, and a\ngreat multitude of the Parisians on foot, marched out of Paris, with\nthe intent to reduce to the king\u2019s obedience the garrisons of Estampes\nand Dourdan, and some others, who continued the war on the part of the\nduke of Orleans and his adherents.\n\nHe halted at Corbeil to wait for the whole of his forces,--and thence,\nwith an immense quantity of warlike stores and bombards, with other\nartillery, marched his army toward Estampes, wherein was sir Louis\nde Bourdon, who instantly withdrew into the castle. The townsmen\nimmediately returned to their former obedience, and were kindly\nreceived by the duke of Acquitaine, in consideration of his uncle the\nduke of Berry. Sir Louis de Bourdon, however, refused to surrender,\nalthough he was summoned many times, when the castle was besieged on\nall sides. The lord de Ront was at this time prisoner there,--for he\nhad been taken by sir Louis not long before the arrival of the duke of\nAcquitaine.\n\nMany engines were now pointed against the walls, which they damaged in\nseveral places; and in addition, miners were employed to underwork the\ntowers. The siege was carried on with such vigour that the garrison,\nthinking it probable they should be taken by storm, opened a parley,\nand, by means of the lord de Ront, surrendered themselves to the duke\nof Acquitaine. Sir Louis de Bourdon, with some other gentlemen, his\nconfederates, were sent to the Ch\u00e2telet at Paris. Great part of the\nwealth of Bourdon, with a most excellent courser of his, were given to\nthe lord de Ront, to make amends for the losses which he sustained when\nhe was made prisoner.\n\nThe dukes of Acquitaine and Burgundy re-garrisoned this place, and\nthen returned with their army to Paris; for in truth, they could not,\nfrom the severity of the winter, make any further progress. A few days\nafter, by order of the duke of Burgundy, many noble prisoners were\ncarried from Paris to the castle of Lille; among whom were the lord de\nHangest, sir Louis de Bourdon, the lords de Gerennes, des Fontaines,\nsir John d\u2019Amboise and others, who had been arrested for supporting the\nparty of the duke of Orleans. They suffered a long confinement, but\nwere set at liberty on paying a heavy fine.\n\nAt this period, sir Mansart du Bos was beheaded in the market-place\nof Paris, his body hung by the shoulders on the gibbet at Montfaucon,\nand his head affixed to the spike on the top of the market-house.\nThis execution took place at the instance of the duke of Burgundy,\nbecause sir Mansart was his liege man, nevertheless he had sent him his\nchallenge at the same time with the brothers of Orleans, as has been\nbefore noticed. Not all the solicitations of his friends could save\nhim, and he had many of weight with the duke, who endeavoured earnestly\nto obtain his pardon; but it was in vain, for the duke had resolved\nupon his death.\n\nThere were in the prisons of the Ch\u00e2telet, and in other prisons of\nParis, very many of the Orleans-party who perished miserably through\ncold, famine, and neglect. When dead, they were inhumanly dragged\nout of the town, and thrown into the ditches a prey to dogs, birds,\nand wild beasts. The reason of such cruel conduct was their having\nbeen several times denounced from the pulpits, and proclaimed from\nthe squares, as excommunicated persons. It seemed, however, to many\ndiscreet men, as well noble as of the church, that it was a great\nscandal thus to treat those who were Christians and acknowledged the\nlaws of JESUS CHRIST.\n\nThe same rigorous conduct being persevered in, a short time after,\na valiant knight, called sir Peter de Famechon, was beheaded in the\nmarket-place of Paris: he was of the household and family of the duke\nof Bourbon,--and his head was affixed to a lance like the others. The\nduke of Bourbon was much exasperated at his death, especially when he\nwas informed of the disgraceful circumstances that had attended it. At\nthis time, therefore, all who sided with the Armagnacs, and were taken,\nran great risk of their lives; for there were few that dared speak in\ntheir favour, however near their connexions might be.\n\n\nEND OF THE SECOND VOLUME.\n\n\n  AT THE HAFOD PRESS,\n  BY JA.

Q. Salines?\n\n[7] This battle was fought on the plains of Eichtfeld, near Tongres.\n\n[8] The lord d\u2019Agimont, son to the lord of Rochefort, and the lord de\nSaraing, according to Placentius.\n\n[9] There seems to have been some pretext, on the score of retaliation,\nfor the commission of these barbarities, the insurgents, during the\ntime of their power, having exercised many similar enormities against\nthose of the government faction.\n\n[10] John, third son of Louis I. and brother of Louis II. de Ch\u00e2lons,\ncounts of Auxerre.\n\n[11] Mentioned in p. 23.\n\n[12] Amblard I. lord of La Ba\u00fbme, had issue, Peter, Perceval, _John_,\nWilliam, and Louis. John was a monk at Ambronnai; but Perceval, who\ncontinued the line, had issue, Amblard II. and William, surnamed\nMorelet, who was grand butler of Burgundy in 1430. Perhaps he is the\n_great lord_ here meant.\n\n[13] Mentioned in vol. i. p. 135.\n\n[14] John III. lord of Crequy and Canaples, is mentioned by Froissart.\nHe had issue, John IV. lord of Crequy, &c. _Reginald_, killed at\nAgincourt, and others.\n\n[15] Escoquehen.

I do not find a queen of Portugal in the catalogue\nof her children; but this event seems to be here strangely misplaced.\nTurquet says, \u2018L\u2019an suyvant, 1418, d\u00e9c\u00e9da la royne D.

He married Philippa, daughter to king\nHenry of England by Eleanora his second wife.\n\n_Eric_ X. king of Denmark, &c. son of Wratislaus duke of Pomerania by\nMary of Mecklenburg, niece to Margaret, _the Semiramis of the north_.\nHis great aunt, Margaret, was still alive.\n\n[21] See before, vol. i. p. 57.\n\n[22] Margaret of Bavaria, sister to the emperor Robert, married Charles\nthe bold, duke of Lorraine.\n\n[23] Margaret, heiress of Vaudemont, married Frederick, brother of\nCharles duke of Lorraine.\n\n[24] Q. Who was this?\n\n[25] John le Maingre, second of the name, count of Beaufort and\nviscount of Turenne. He was the son of mareschal Boucicaut the elder,\nmentioned by Froissart, who died in 1371. He was himself made a\nmareschal of France in 1391, having been knighted, nine years before,\nat the battle of Rosebec in Flanders. He went into Hungary and was\npresent at the battle of Nicopolis, and made prisoner with John count\nof Nevers. He was again appointed to the relief of the emperor of\nConstantinople in 1399. In 1401, he was made governor of Genoa,--and\nhe took the city of Famagousta in Cyprus for the Genoese. He was made\nprisoner at Agincourt, and died in England 1421. He was a poet as well\nas warrior, and composed many rondeaux and virelays. In his epitaph, he\nis called Constable to the emperor of Constantinople.\n\n[26] See Shepherd\u2019s Life of Poggio, p. 42.\n\n[27] Robert Hallam, cardinal, and chancellor of the university of\nOxford.\n\n[28] Brandac.

See vol i. p. 63.\n\n[30] Ladislaus, or Lancelot, son of Charles of Durazzo, and brother to\nJoan II. who succeeded to the crown of Naples on his death in 1412.\n\nHe took up arms on behalf of Gregory, and invaded the florentine\nterritories in the year 1409, at the head of a large body of forces.\nThe proceedings of the council were in fact detrimental to him, as\nby its decree he was deposed, and the neapolitan crown vested in his\ncompetitor, the duke of Anjou. He had also seized many towns in the\npatrimony of St Peter, and among the rest on Rome itself.--See _Poggio_\n_Hist. Florent._ p. 178. et seq.\n\n[31] Flisque. Q. Fiesco?\n\n[32] Elizabeth, daughter of John duke of Luxembourg, brother of\nWenceslaus king of Bohemia, and _ci-devant_ emperor. See vol. i. p. 63.\n\n[33] John lord of Puisaye, fifth son to the duke of Bar.\n\n[34] Bona, third daughter of the duke of Bar, married to Waleran count\nof St Pol.\n\n[35] Charles de Montagu, to whom the confiscated honours of the vidame\ndu Laonnois and lord of Marcoussy were restored after the death of his\nfather. There was no issue of this marriage with Catherine d\u2019Albret.\n\n[36] Margaret de Clisson, widow of John de Blois and mother of Oliver,\ncounts of Penthievre.\n\n[37] John Maria and Philip Maria, sons of John Galeas, and successively\ndukes of Milan.\n\n[38] Theodore Pal\u00e6ologus, second marquis of Montferrat. He married,\nfirst, a daughter of the duke of Bar, and, secondly, a princess of\nthe house of Savoy. His daughter Sophia was married to Philip Maria\nVisconti, then count of Pavia, afterwards duke of Milan.\n\n[39] Facino Cane, a captain of great reputation, and partisan of John\nMaria Visconti, duke of Milan.\n\n[40] Gaing. Q. Gavi?\n\n[41] Noefville. Q. Novara, or Novi?\n\n[42] Q. Louis king of Sicily? or Charles king of Navarre? Probably the\nlatter.\n\n[43] John VI. count of Roucy and Braine, son of Hugh count de Roucy\nand Blanche of Coucy. He married Isabel de Montagu, and was killed at\nAgincourt.\n\n[44] The lords of Antoing and princes of Espinoy were a younger branch\nof the house of Melun, counts of Tancarville. John I. viscount of\nMelun, was grandfather both to the count of Tancarville and the lord\nd\u2019Antoing, mentioned in this volume.\n\n[45] Guichard Dauphin, descended from the old counts de Clermont,\ndauphins of Auvergne, grand master from 1409 to 1413. He was son to\nGuichard Dauphin I. grand master of the cross-bows.\n\n[46] Amadeus VIII. the first duke of Savoy, son of Amadeus VII. and\nBona daughter to the duke of Berry.\n\n[47] Bernard VII. brother of John III. count of Armagnac, killed at\nAlexandria della Paglia, as related by Froissart. This count was a\nman of the most unbounded ambition, and had already, in the forcible\nseizure of the county of Fesenzaguet, (the appanage of a younger branch\nof Armagnac) and the murder of its count, Geraud III. and his two sons,\ndiscovered an unprincipled cruelty of disposition, remarkable even at\nthis calamitous period of history. He married Bona of Berry, the widow\nof Amadeus VII. and mother of Amadeus VIII. above mentioned.\n\n[48] Martin king of Sicily, by whose death without issue the king of\nArragon was deprived of male heirs. The island of Sardinia was at this\ntime divided between the genoese and arragonian factions. The chief of\nthe former was Brancaleon d\u2019Oria, whose sister was married to William\ncount of Narbonne. Turquet calls him Aimery,--and says that the king\nof Sicily was not killed, but died a natural death at Cagliari, after\nobtaining a victory over the confederates.\n\n[49] Q. Angennes? John d\u2019Angennes, lord de la Louppe, was governor of\nDauphin\u00e8 and afterwards of the Louvre, and enjoyed great credit at\ncourt.\n\n[50] This Yvain Graindos is a strange corruption, if any corruption\nin the french nomenclature can be strange to a practised ear, of Owen\nGlendower, who, as Rapin says, \u2018upon the Welch unanimously renouncing\ntheir allegiance to the crown of England, and acknowledging him for\nsovereign, from thenceforward always styled himself Prince of Wales, as\nappears from several acts.\u2019\n\n[51] In a battle fought May 14. 1405. See Rapin\u2019s History of England\n_in loco_.\n\n[52] De Dolhaing. Q. D\u2019Olhaing?\n\n[53] I suppose Monstrelet must mean Jagellon, grand duke of Lithuania,\nwho was called to the throne of Poland in 1386, on condition that\nhe would become a Christian, marry the daughter of the late king,\nand annex Lithuania to Poland. This last condition, however, was not\ncompletely fulfilled until the reign of Sigismond Augustus in 1569.\n\n  _Baudran._\n\nJagellon took the name of Uladislaus V. on his baptism; but Hedwige,\ndaughter to the king of Poland, reigned two years before she married\nUladislaus.\n\n  _Anderson._\n\n\n[54] Sigismond was king of Hungary in 1387,--roman emperor 1411,--king\nof Bohemia 1419,--died 1437, aged 70. He married for his second wife\nBarbara, daughter to Hermannus II. count of Cilly in Crain.\n\n  _Anderson._\n\n\n[55] Of the half blood. See p. 138.\n\n[56] _I. e._ Bari.\n\n[57] Probably Nicholas d\u2019Este, connected by marriage with the house of\nMalatesta.\n\n[58] Probably Pandulph Malatesta, lord of Rimini, a captain of great\nreputation and adherent of king Ladislaus.\n\n[59] Sir Raoul de Gaucourt, successively promoted to the posts of\nchamberlain, governor of Dauphin\u00e8, and grand master of the household,\nbecame a distinguished actor in the wars with the English, from 1427 to\n1437 particularly.\n\nThere was also a sir Eustace de Gaucourt, lord of Vicy, who was grand\nfalconer in 1406 and 1412.\n\n[60] Count de Hembe. Q.\n\n[61] Charles de Mouroufle. Q.\n\n[62] The author of \u2018An Account of Livonia, with a Relation of the Rise,\nProgress and Decay of the Marian Teutonic Order,\u2019 London, 1701, relates\nthese transactions in the manner following:\n\n\u2018The order was now on the highest pinnacle of prosperity and honour,\nexceeding great kings and potentates of Europe in extent of dominions,\npower and riches, when Ulricus \u00e0 Jungingen was chosen great master; but\nhe being of a boisterous, fiery temper, soon broke the peace concluded\nbetween Poland with his brother Conradus \u00e0 Jungingen, whereupon\nking Uladislaus Jagellon joining forces with his father Witoldas of\nLithuania, formed an army of 150,000 fighting men and marched into\nPrussia. To stop the progress of this formidable army, the great master\ndrew up as many forces as he could, and, after the Livonians had\njoined him, found his army consisted, in a general muster, of 83,000\nwell armed stout combatants; and thus, with an undaunted spirit, he\nmarched forth to meet his enemy. Such a battle as this was never heard\nof before in these parts, and was given the 15th day of July 1410 in\nPrussia, near the town Gilgenbourg, between the two villages Tannenberg\nand Grunwald, on a large plain, with such obstinacy that, according\nto an exact computation, there were actually killed, on both sides,\n100,000 on the spot. The Poles got the victory, but lost 60,000 men.\nThe order lost 40,000,--but among them almost all their generals and\ncommanders. The great master himself, and the chief of the order, with\n600 noble german marian knights, were there slain. There is still\nkept every year a day of devotion upon that plain, in a chapel built\nto the remembrance of this battle, marked with the date of the year\nit happened, and this inscription, _Centum mille occisi_. The king of\nPoland was so weakened by this dear-bought victory that he very readily\nagreed to a peace. This memorable battle is called The Battle of\nTannenberg.\u2019\n\n[63] Moreri says, that the good duke Louis died at Monbucan on the 19th\nof August 1410. By his wife Anne, dauphiness of Auvergne and countess\nof Forez, he left John count of Clermont, his son and successor:\nhis other children, Louis and two daughters, died without issue and\nunmarried. He left also a natural son, named Hector, who was killed at\nthe siege of Soissons in 1414.\n\n[64] Boulogne, the property of the duke of Berry, by marriage with\nJane, heiress of Auvergne and Boulogne.\n\n    The county of Estampes belonged to the duke of Berry,\n    Valois, I believe, to the count d\u2019Alen\u00e7on,\n    Beaumont to the duke of Orleans,--and\n    Clermont to the duke of Bourbon.\n\n\n[65] Vinchestre, or rather Winchester,--now called Bic\u00eatre, was a\npalace built by a bishop of Winchester 1290. For further particulars,\nsee \u2018Sauval Antiquit\u00e8s de Paris\u2019, vol. ii. book vii.\n\n[66] I hardly know whether this can be the celebrated archbishop of\nRheims, and historian of the reign of Charles VI. who was one of the\nmost learned men of his time, and died at an advanced age, in 1474.\nHe had two brothers older than himself, William des Ursins, baron\nof Treynel, chancellor of France in 1445, and again in 1464,--and\nJames Juvenal des Ursins, who was archbishop of Rheims before him.\nThe history written by Juvenal des Ursins occupies the space from\n1380 to 1422, and throws great light, by comparison, on Froissart and\nMonstrelet.\n\n[67] Q. De Nesle?\n\nGuy III. de Nesle, lord of Offemont and Mello, was grand master of the\nhousehold to queen Isabella, and was killed at Agincourt. His two sons,\n_John_ III. and Guy IV. followed him in succession. He had a third son,\nwho died with him at Agincourt.\n\n[68] Monstrelet apparently mistakes. According to Moreri, _Robert_ duke\nof Bar died this year, leaving issue by his wife Mary (daughter to John\nking of France),\n\n    1. Henry lord d\u2019Ossy, who died in Hungary, 1396, leaving by his\n    wife Mary de Coucy, countess of Soissons, one son, Robert count\n    of Marle and Soissons, killed at Agincourt.\n\n    2. Philip, died in Hungary 1396.\n\n    3. Edward III. marquis du Pont, and duke of Bar after his\n    father\u2019s death.\n\n    4. Louis cardinal of Bar.\n\n    5. Charles lord of Nogent.\n\n    6. John lord of Puisaye. (Both Edward and John were killed at\n    Agincourt.)\n\n    7. Yoland, queen of Arragon.\n\n    8. Mary, countess of Namur.\n\n    9. Bona, countess of St Pol.\n\nOne striking peculiarity is discernible in this table, viz. the\npreference shown in the succession to Edward the third son, over\nRobert, son of the eldest son of the deceased duke; but this was\naccording to the law of many feudal tenures, which took no notice of\nour universally-established doctrine of _representation_ in descents.\nThe same law prevailed in Artois, and was the ground of that famous\ndecision by which Robert d\u2019Artois was ejected in the middle of the\nfourteenth century, and in consequence of which he retired in disgust\nto the court of our Edward III. who asserted the justice of his\npretensions.\n\n[69] He was a peer as duke of Burgundy, and again a peer as\ncount-palatine of Burgundy.\n\n[70] John, called count de Ligny, third son of John count of Brienne,\nbrother to the count de St Pol.\n\n[71] James de Ch\u00e2tillon was appointed admiral in 1408, in the room\nof Clugnet de Breban. He was lord of Dampierre, and son of Hugh de\nCh\u00e2tillon, formerly master of the cross-bows.\n\n[72] Nephew of duke Edward. See p. 232.\n\n[73] The advice which, according to Stowe, king Henry gave to the duke\nof Burgundy on this occasion was deserving of more attention than he\nwas disposed to pay to it. \u2018The duke of Burgoyne, desiring the king\u2019s\naid against the duke of Orliance, promised many things,--amongst the\nwhich he promised his daughter in marriage to the prince, and a great\nsum of gold with her. To whom the king answered: \u2018We advertise you not\nto fight with your enemie in this case, who justly seemeth to vexe\nyou, for the death of his father by you procured, but as much as in\nyou lyeth endeavor yourself to mitigate the young man\u2019s wrath, and\npromise to make him reasonable satisfaction, according to the advice\nof your friends; and if then he will not cease from persecuting you,\nget you into the strongest place of your dominion, and there gather\nsuch power as may be able to put off his force. If then, after this,\nhe will make war against you, you shall have the juster occasion to\nfight with him,--and in such case we will shew you such favour as yee\nhave demaunded.\u2019 Thus there were sent over to his ayde Thomas earl of\nArundell, Gilbert Umfreville earl of Angus, or earl of Kyme, sir Robert\nUmfreville, sir John Oldcastle, lord Cobham, sir John Grey and William\nPorter, with twelve hundred archers,\u2019 &c. &c.\n\n[74] According to the catalogue in Moreri, Arnauld de Corbie, lord of\nJoigny, was at this time chancellor.\n\n[75] Called William Porter by Stowe.\n\n[76] Q. If this is not _Umfreville_ earl of Angus and _Kyme_ (as Stowe\ncalls him)? There was at this period no Neville earl of Kent. The\nonly earl of Kent of that family was William Nevil lord Falconbridge,\ncreated 1461. I find this conjecture somewhat confirmed by the\noriginal, which is, \u2018Ousieville comte de Kam.\u2019 It is true, that\nHolinshed mentions the earls of Pembroke and of _Kent_ as being of the\nexpedition: but he cites Monstrelet as his authority, and is therefore\nlikely to be mistaken.\n\n[77] \u2018Que _\u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s_ elle _ne_ mourast de deuil.\u2019 \u2018That she was\nwithin a little of dying with grief.\u2019 Mary of Berry, daughter of John\nduke of Berry, and wife to John duke of Bourbon (her third husband, she\nhaving been before twice a widow, first of Louis de Ch\u00e2tillon count\nof Dunois, and, secondly, of the constable d\u2019Eu), lived till the year\n1434, when she died at Lyons. See Morery. Her children by the duke of\nBourbon were Charles, duke of Bourbon after his father,--Louis, who\ndied young,--and another Louis, founder of the line of Montpensier.\n\n[78] John II. lord of Rieux and Rochefort. According to Morery\u2019s\ncatalogue, two mareschals were created this year,--Louis lord of\nLoigny, and James lord of Heilly, commonly called Mareschal of\nAcquitaine.\n\n[79] See p. 328.\n\n\n[Transcriber's Note:\n\nInconsistent spelling and hyphenation are as in the original.\n\nSeven instances of \u201cPier-vves\u201d changed to read \u201cPier-Yves\u201d; and one\ninstance of \u201cPierre-vves\u201d changed to read \u201cPierre-Yves.\u201d]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Chronicles of Enguerrand de\nMonstrelet, Volume 2 (of 13), by Enguerrand de Monstrelet\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK CHRONICLES--ENGUERRAND MONSTRELET, VOL 2 ***\n\n***** This file should be named 52607-0.txt or 52607-0.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/5/2/6/0/52607/\n\nProduced by Wayne Hammond and The Online Distributed\nProofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net (This file was\nproduced from images generously made available by The\nInternet Archive)\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will\nbe renamed.\n\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United\nStates without permission and without paying copyright\nroyalties.

I.\n\n    THE CONCLUSION OF THE DUCHESS OF ORLEANS\u2019 ADVOCATE AGAINST THE\n    DUKE OF BURGUNDY, AND THE REPLY FROM THE CHANCELLOR.\n\n\nThe chancellor of France, in the king\u2019s name, ordered the duchess\u2019s\nadvocate, master William Cousinot, to draw up such conclusions as\nshould be satisfactory to the duchess and her son, the duke of Orleans.\nThe advocate, after many excuses, began by showing how pitiable their\nstate was, and took for his theme part of the 7th chapter of the gospel\nof St Luke, \u2018H\u00e6c vidua erat quam cum vidisset Dominus misericordia\nmotus est super eam.\u2019\n\n\u2018Most noble prince, when our Lord entered a city called Nain, he met\nthe corpse of a young man, which his friends were carrying to the\ngrave; and when he noticed that the mother of the young man was a\nwidow, he was on this account moved with compassion toward her, and\nrestored her son to life. I may most truly apply these words to my\nlady of Orleans, for she is a widow who bewails the death of her lord\nand husband, and our lord will have compassion on her; for the king\nis our lord, in respect of terrestrial jurisdiction; and not only the\nking, but thou, lord of Acquitaine, and all other princes of this world\nhaving territorial powers, seeing my lady of Orleans thus disconsolate,\nought to feel compassion for her, and give her aid and support in\nprocuring strict justice to be done for the cruel death of her husband.\n\n\u2018In every case, and at all times, full justice should be administered\nto all; for, according to the words of the Psalmist, it is a good and\nmeritorious act,--\u2018Beati qui custodiunt judicium et faciunt justitiam\nin omni tempore.\u2019 Psalm cv.\n\n\u2018But justice should always be more rigorously observed in regard\nto widows and orphans, who have been deprived of their fathers or\nhusbands, than in any other case; for the divine, canon and civil\nlaws urge the necessity of succouring the widow and orphan. We have\nthe first instance of this in the 22d chapter of Jeremiah,--\u2018Facite\njudicium et justitiam, et liberate vi oppressum de manu calumniatoris,\npupillum et viduam,\u2019 &c.\n\n\u2018In regard to the canon law, the decrees declare, that it is very\nproper for kings to do justice and execute judgment, and deliver from\nthe hands of the oppressors widows and orphans who are injuriously used\nby them.\n\n\u2018As for the civil law, it is very clear, that widows and orphans are\nparticularly privileged in many cases, as may be seen in different law\nwritings.\n\n\u2018My lady of Orleans has lost her husband: her children have lost their\nfather, certainly one of the handsomest and most accomplished princes\nin Christendom. But let us see how they have lost him: had he been\ntaken from them by a natural death, their case would not have been so\nmuch to be pitied; but he is cut off violently in the flower of his\nyouth. In truth, this is such an outrage that every law and customary\nproceeding should bend in their favour against the malignant author of\nthe deed.\n\n\u2018In the first place, our king and sovereign lord is bounden\nparticularly by the commands of God, to whom he cannot be disobedient\nwithout sinning, to execute judgment, according to the words of\nJeremiah in the chapter before mentioned,--\u2018In memetipso juravi, dicit\nDominus, quia in solitudine erit domus vestra.\u2019 And this is conformable\nto the reply made by St Remy to king Clovis when he baptised him. The\nking asked him how long the kingdom of France would endure. The saint\nanswered, that it would last so long as justice should reign there. The\nconverse of which is, that when justice shall cease to be administered,\nthe kingdom will fall. To the king therefore may be applied what is\nwritten in the canon law, \u2018Quod justitia est illud quod suum firmat\nimperium.\u2019\n\n\u2018O, duke of Acquitaine! thou art he who, after the king, art bound\nto do justice according to the words of the Psalmist, \u2018Deus judicium\ntuum regi da et justitiam tuam filio regis.\u2019 Thou art the eldest son\nto the king, to whom, by the grace of God, thou wilt succeed, and be\nour lord: attend to our case for the love of God, for to thee more\nparticularly does it belong; and if thou dost not lay thy hand on it,\nwhen thou shalt come to reign, thou mayest find thy kingdom desolate\nand destroyed,--for each will in his turn seize parts of it, and be the\nmaster, should this atrocious crime remain unpunished.\n\n\u2018Ye also, my lords, princes, dukes and counts of the royal blood,\nrelations of the late duke, and ye other nobles, who have an affection\nfor the king\u2019s crown and honour, what ought to be your conduct on\nthis occasion? Why, certainly, if the king will not interfere in this\nmatter, ye ought to take up the business and execute judgment; for ye\nare bound by oath to guard and defend the king\u2019s honour against all who\nmay infringe upon it. This ye have done in former times, through God\u2019s\ngrace, and for which this kingdom has gained greater glory than any\nother realm in Christendom: insomuch that the English, the Germans, and\nother foreigners, have come hither to seek for justice.\n\n\u2018My lords, for the love of God, let your loyalty burst forth, according\nto your oaths, in behalf of my lady of Orleans, as she has the fullest\nconfidence it will; for, after God and the king, you are her only\nrefuge. Let no one fear to do justice, from the scandal or persecution\nthat may ensue, for it is a maxim of law, \u2018Utilius est scandalum nasci\nac permitti, quam ut veritas relinquatur,\u2019--although it were certain\nthe doing justice in this case would cause much grievous persecution\nto ensue. Yet for all this justice should not be neglected; for in\nthat case you would be indeed reproachable, if, through fear of the\noffender, you shall not dare to decree justice. On no occasion should\njustice be neglected: therefore, my lords, act according to what the\nprophet says, \u2018Viriliter agite, et confortetur cor vestrum et sustinete\nDominum.\u2019\n\n\u2018In truth, if ye do not act with courage, for one inconvenience that\nmay happen, by executing judgment, one hundred would ensue from default\nof justice. Therefore, my lords, do not hesitate to do justice to my\nlady of Orleans and her children from any dread of inconveniences\nthat may happen, but follow the dictates of our Lord,--\u2018Judicare\npupillo et humili ut non apponat magnificare se homo super terram.\u2019\nLet the punishment be so exemplary that none other may henceforth\ncommit so great or so disgraceful a crime, and that it may be held\nin perpetual memory and abhorrence. This is the object of my lady of\nOrleans and her children, namely, that the crime may be atoned for as\nheavily as possible in this world. In order that this atonement may\nbe made, my lady of Orleans and her children would willingly take the\nlegal steps for the infliction of capital punishment, if this could\nregularly be done; but as these steps, according to the customary\nusage of France, belong to the king\u2019s attorney-general alone, they\npropose that the offender shall be punished in manner following,--that\nis to say, by sentence of the king and of the court, be it ordered\nthat our adversary, the duke of Burgundy, be brought to the castle of\nthe Louvre, or elsewhere, according to the king\u2019s pleasure and that\nof my clients, and there, in the presence of the king, of my lord of\nAcquitaine, and the other princes of the blood, as well as of the\ncouncil and people, the duke of Burgundy, without hood or girdle,\nshall, on his knees, publicly confess, with a loud voice, before my\nlady of Orleans, her children, and as many other persons as she may\nplease, that maliciously and treacherously he has had my lord of\nOrleans assassinated, through hatred, envy and ambition, and for no\nother cause, notwithstanding all the charges made against him, and\nother imputations thrown on his character, to justify and exculpate\nhimself from so base a deed; and shall demand pardon from my lady of\nOrleans and her children, most humbly supplicating them to forgive his\noffences, declaring that he knows of nothing prejudicial to the honour\nand reputation of the said duke of Orleans deceased, and recals all he\nmay have said or published to the contrary.\n\n\u2018In this state he shall be carried to the court of the palace, and to\nthe h\u00f4tel de Saint Pol, the residence of the king, and to the spot\nwhere the murder was committed, and there, on high stages erected for\nthe purpose, he shall repeat the above words before such commissioners\nas my lady of Orleans and her son may please to appoint. He shall\nremain on his knees, at the last place, until priests nominated for\nthe purpose shall have recited the seven penitential psalms, said the\nlitany, and the other parts of the burial service, for the soul of the\ndeceased, after which he shall kiss the earth, and ask pardon of God,\nof my lady of Orleans, and of her children, for the offences he has\ncommitted against them.\n\n\u2018The manner and form of this recantation, and begging pardon, shall be\nwritten out, and copies sent to all the different towns in the kingdom\nwith orders for the magistrates to have them proclaimed by sound of\ntrumpet, that it may be notorious to all within and without the realm.\n\n\u2018And as additional reparations for such offences, and that they may\nremain in perpetual remembrance, all the houses belonging to the duke\nof Burgundy in Paris shall be razed to the ground, and remain in ruins\nfor ever. On the places where any of his houses shall have stood, there\nshall be erected handsome crosses of stone, having large and strong\ntablets, on which shall be written a full account of the murder of my\nlate lord, the duke of Orleans, and the cause of these houses being\ndestroyed.\n\n\u2018On the spot where my late lord was murdered shall be erected a similar\ncross; and the house wherein the murderers hid themselves shall be\npulled down. This spot, and the adjoining houses, the duke of Burgundy\nshall be forced to purchase, and to build thereon a handsome college\nfor six canons, six vicars, and six chaplains, whose nominations shall\nremain with my lady of Orleans and her heirs. In this college six\nmasses shall be said every day for the soul of the deceased duke of\nOrleans, and high mass at the usual time of canonical hours. For the\nsupport of this college there shall be a mortmain rent of one thousand\nlivres parisis; and the whole shall be well furnished with dresses,\nbooks, chalices, ornaments, and all other necessaries, at the sole\nexpense of the duke of Burgundy; and over the entrance shall be written\nin large letters the cause of its foundation.\n\n\u2018The duke of Burgundy shall, beside, be constrained to found a college\nfor the salvation of the soul of the deceased, in the town of Orleans,\nconsisting of twelve canons, twelve vicars, and twelve clerks, which\ncollege shall bear the name of the defunct; and the nominations to\nit shall belong to my lady of Orleans, and to the heirs of the late\nduke of Orleans. It shall be situated in whatever part of the late\nduke\u2019s possessions in Orleans the duchess shall please, and shall be\nhandsomely constructed, furnished with books and all other necessaries,\nwith an income of two thousand livres parisis; and a similar\ninscription to the one before mentioned shall be placed over the gate.\n\n\u2018For the greater perpetuity of this event, and that it may be made\nknown to all foreign nations, the duke of Burgundy shall be enjoined to\nerect two chapels; the one near the holy sepulchre at Jerusalem, and\nthe other at Rome, and assign to each the annual value of one hundred\nlivres in the coin of those countries, and to provide them with all\nnecessary furniture. In each of these chapels shall a daily mass be\nsaid for the soul of the deceased, and over the doors shall be placed\nthe same inscriptions as over the colleges.\n\n\u2018The duke of Burgundy shall also be constrained to pay the sum of\none million in gold, not to the profit of my lady of Orleans or her\nchildren, but to found and endow hospitals and monasteries, and to\ndistribute in alms and other works of piety for the salvation of the\nsoul of the defunct.\n\n\u2018That this sentence may be carried into due effect, all the lands\nwhich the duke of Burgundy possesses in this kingdom shall be placed\nin the hands of the king, that they may be sold for the accomplishment\nof the above works. The duke of Burgundy shall also be condemned to\nclose imprisonment in whatever place it may please the king, until\nthe above sentence be carried into execution. After which, he shall\nbe banished for ever beyond sea, or at least for the space of twenty\nyears, to bewail and repent of his crime, or until it shall be thought\nhe may have sufficiently done it. On his return, he shall be ordered,\nunder severe penalties, never to approach within one hundred leagues of\nthe queen or the children of the late duke of Orleans, without being\ncondemned to such heavy damages, and other penalties suited to the\nenormity of the case, as shall be held in perpetual remembrance. He\nshall also be condemned to pay whatever costs my lady of Orleans and\nher children may have occurred on this present occasion.\n\n\u2018I say, therefore, that such ought to be the judgment given for them,\nand without delay, considering the notoriety and enormity of the\noffence of our adversary; for it is publicly known, that the duke of\nBurgundy has confessed himself guilty of it. He first made a confession\nof his guilt to my lord of Berry and to the king of Sicily, giving no\nreason for it but that he was urged on by the devil: he then did the\nsame before several noblemen. This ought therefore to weigh against\nhim, and convict him of the crime, without further trial: nor ought\nyou to suffer any sort of colouring to be admitted in palliation of\nhis guilt. He ought not to be heard otherwise than he has been, for\nhe varied not in his confessions to the different persons; and pope\nInnocent approves of this, in his chapter on Free Will, and Guillermus\nde Montleon, in his chapter on Clerical Constitutions. Pope Nicholas\nheld king Lothaire, in like manner, convicted to his prejudice in a\ncertain case, about which he had written to the pope, as appears in\nthe above chapter. This confession of king Lothaire had been made in\na letter, previously to any trial. The duke of Burgundy, therefore,\nought to be condemned from this public confession of his crime in the\npresence of different persons. He has beside made a similar confession\nwhen he appeared publicly before thee, lord of Acquitaine, when thou\ndidst sit in judgment representing the person of the king, and before\nthe princes of the blood and all the council of state. He cannot,\ntherefore, deny his having made such confession before competent\njudges. It follows then, that no further trial is necessary, but that\nsentence should immediately be passed; for confession of guilt should\nbe judged the fullest evidence.\n\n\u2018The law says, \u2018In confitentem null\u00e6 sunt partes judicantis.\u2019 And\nsupposing, that according to some, a sentence is requisite, at least\nit is certain that no trial or examination of the cause is necessary,\nsince this present case is extremely notorious. So has it formerly been\ndetermined by the sentence and judgment of the kings in times past,\nagainst several great lords of their day,--to wit, that when the facts\nwere notorious, no other process or inquisition was required. And so\nshall it be determined, by the grace of God, in the present case,--for\nso reason demands.\n\n\u2018Should it, however, be thought necessary to go into another trial,\nwhich, from all I have said, I cannot suppose, my lady of Orleans\nis ready prepared to bring forward the fullest proof of what I have\nadvanced, and such as must convince all reasonable persons. But as my\nlady can now only offer civil conclusions, and would willingly propose\ncriminal ones, but that it belongs to the king\u2019s attorney-general\naccording to the usage in France,--my lady, therefore, most earnestly\nsupplicates the king\u2019s attorney to join with her, and propose such\nsentence as the law in this case requires.\u2019\n\nThese were the conclusions of my lady of Orleans and her sons,--after\nwhich, the council of the princes of the blood, and others of the\nking\u2019s council, with the approbation of the duke of Acquitaine, made\nthe chancellor reply to the duchess of Orleans, that the duke of\nAcquitaine, as lieutenant for the king, and representing his person,\nand the princes of the blood-royal were well satisfied with her\nconduct respecting her late lord the duke of Orleans: that they held\nhim perfectly exculpated from all the charges that had been brought\nagainst him; and that, in regard to her requests, speedy and good\njustice should be done her, so that she should be reasonably contented\ntherewith.\n\nA few days after, the young duke of Orleans, Charles, did homage for\nthe duchy of Orleans, and all his other possessions, to his uncle\nCharles king of France: then, taking leave of the queen and dauphin,\nand the princes of the blood who were in Paris, he departed with his\nmen at arms for Blois, whence he had come. The duchess-dowager of\nOrleans remained in Paris.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. II.\n\n    GUYE DE ROVE, ARCHBISHOP OF RHEIMS, APPEALS FROM THE\n    CONSTITUTIONS DRAWN UP BY THE UNIVERSITY OF PARIS, WHICH ANGERS\n    THAT BODY, AND THEY IMPRISON HIS COMMISSARY.\n\n\nAt this period, Guy de Roye[1], archbishop of Rheims, who had been\nsummoned specially by the king to attend the meeting of the prelates at\nParis, assembled to consider on the means of uniting the whole church,\nneither came himself nor sent any one in his behalf. He refused to\nagree to the decisions of this council, and sent a chaplain as his\ncommissary, with letters signed with his name and seal, to confirm his\nopposition to all the statutes they had drawn up, as well for himself\nand his diocese as for all his subjects within the province.\n\nThe king and the clergy were much displeased at this conduct; and the\nuniversity of Paris requested that the commissary should be confined in\nclose imprisonment, where he remained for a long time.\n\nThe cardinal of Bordeaux came at this time to Paris, partly for the\nunion of the church; and then also returned thither master Peter Paoul,\nand the patriarch of Alexandria, named master Symon Cramant, who\nhad been sent by the king of France and the university of Paris, as\nambassadors to the two rival popes.\n\nThe assembled prelates were very anxious for their arrival, that they\nmight be better acquainted with the business they had to manage, and on\nwhat grounds they should proceed. Master Peter Paoul frequently rode\nthrough the streets of Paris in his doctor\u2019s dress, accompanied by the\ncardinal riding on one side of his horse as women do. In the presence\nof this cardinal and doctor, the abbot of Caudebec, of the order of\nCistercians, and doctor in theology, proposed, on the part of the\nuniversity, an union of the church. The abbot of St Denis, with other\ndoctors in theology, declared for an union of the universal church;\nand, shortly after, the cardinal departed from Paris for Boulogne, and\nthence went to Calais.\n\nThe abbot of St Denis and another doctor of theology, who had been, by\nthe king\u2019s orders, confined in the prison of the Louvre, were released,\nat the request of the cardinal de Bar, and set at liberty, contrary to\nthe will of the university of Paris. In like manner did the bishop of\nCambray, master Peter d\u2019Ailly, an excellent doctor of theology, gain\nhis liberty. He had been confined at the instance of the university,\nbecause he was not favourable to their sentiments, and was delivered\nat the entreaties of count Waleran de St Pol, and the great council of\nthe king. All Christendom was now divided in religious opinions, as\nto the head of the church, by the contentions of the two rival popes,\nwho could not be brought to agree on the means to put an end to this\ndisgraceful schism.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. III.\n\n    THE DUKE OF BURGUNDY ASSEMBLES A LARGE BODY OF MEN AT ARMS TO\n    SUCCOUR JOHN OF BAVARIA AGAINST THE LIEGEOIS, AND COMBATS THEM.\n\n\nAbout this time, John duke of Burgundy was busily employed in\ncollecting a body of men at arms to aid his brother-in-law, the bishop\nof Liege, whom, as has been said, the Liegeois had driven out of their\ncountry, and besieged in the town of Maestricht. He sent for succour\namong his friends and allies, namely, to Burgundy, Flanders, Artois,\nand the borders of Picardy, whence came very many, and several from\nSavoy.\n\nThe earl of Mar, also, a Scotsman, then at Bruges, with about four\nscore combatants, ready to embark for Scotland, advanced into the\nTournesis, whither the duke came, and had a conference with their\nprincipal captains in the town of Tournay.\n\nOn the eleventh day of September, he marched thence with a\nnumerous body of men at arms, and a great train of artillery and\nbaggage-waggons to Enghien, where he was gladly received by the lord\nof the place. On the morrow, he advanced to Nivelle in Brabant, within\na league of Salmes. He marched next to Flourines, where he met sir\nRichard[2] Daulphin, sir William de Tignonville, lately provost of\nParis, and master William Bouratier, one of the king\u2019s secretaries,\nambassadors to him from the king of France. Having obtained an\naudience, they said they had been sent to him from the king and the\ngreat council on two objects; first, to know whether the Liegeois and\ntheir bishop were willing to submit their differences to the king and\nthe great council; secondly, to inform him of the suit urged against\nhim by the duchess-dowager of Orleans and her children, for the death\nof the late duke of Orleans, his brother, of the replies they had made\nto the charges he had brought against the late duke, and that they\ndemanded instant justice on him the duke of Burgundy, and that neither\nlaw nor reason ought to prevent sentence being passed by the king\naccording to the conclusions that had been drawn up against him.\n\nThe duke of Burgundy shortly answered, that in regard to the first\npoint, he was willing, as was right for him to do, to obey the king\u2019s\norders, but that his brother-in-law, John of Bavaria, who had married\nhis sister, had most earnestly solicited his assistance against the\ncommonalty and his subjects of Liege, who had rebelled, and even held\nhim besieged. Similar requests had been made to duke William, count\nof Hainault, his brother in law, and also brother-in-law to John of\nBavaria: wherefore the armaments could not now be broken up, since\nduring the time the ambassadors would be negotiating between the two\nparties, John of Bavaria, their bishop and lord, might be in great\ndanger from his rebellious subjects, and their success might serve for\nan example and inducement for other subjects to resist their lords, and\ngive rise to an universal rebellion. He added, that the king and his\ncouncil might, without any prejudice to themselves, have refrained from\nso readily listening to such requests, as none of the aforesaid parties\nwere subjects to the kingdom of France.\n\nIn regard to the second point, he, John duke of Burgundy, made answer,\nthat instantly on his return from this expedition he would wait on\nthe king of France, and act towards him, and all others, in a manner\nbecoming a good subject, and the near relationship in which he stood to\nthe king.\n\nThe ambassadors, finding they could not obtain more satisfactory\nanswers to the points on which they were sent, were obliged to be\ncontented. They resolved, however, to wait the event of this expedition\nagainst the Liegeois; and during that time there came to the duke\nof Burgundy, from the country of Hainault, his brother-in-law duke\nWilliam, accompanied by the counts de Conversan, de Namur, and de\nSalines, in Ardennes, with many notable lords, as well knights as\nesquires, from Hainault, Holland, Zealand, Ostrevant, and other\nplaces, to the number of twelve hundred helmets[3], or thereabout, and\ntwo thousand infantry well equipped, with from five to six hundred\ncarriages laden with provision and military stores.\n\nMany councils were held at Flourines, and in that neighbourhood, as\nto their future conduct, and whither they might march their army\nwith the greatest probability of success. It was determined that duke\nWilliam should command the van, and, as he advanced, destroy the whole\ncountry with fire and sword; that the duke of Burgundy, with the earl\nof Mar and the main body, should direct their march along the causeway\nof Branchaut, which leads strait to Tongres and Maestricht. In the\nlast place, the lord de Pier-Yves[4] and the Liegeois had, as has been\nbefore said, besieged their bishop and lord, John of Bavaria.\n\nIn consequence of this resolution, the two dukes began their march\nby different roads, and destroyed all the country on the Tuesday,\nWednesday and Thursday, and met on the Saturday evening, about vespers,\nin the town of Montenach, situated on the above causeway. In this\nplace and neighbourhood was the whole army lodged, forming but one\nbody; and two marshals were appointed to command and find quarters for\nit;--on the part of the duke of Burgundy, the lord de Vergy[5],--and\non that of duke William, the lord de Jeumont. They had under their\nimmediate orders five hundred helmets, seven hundred cross-bows, and\nfifteen hundred archers, all men of tried courage, with sixteen hundred\ncarriages, as well carts as waggons, laden with arms, ammunition and\nprovision, and all other necessaries for such an expedition.\n\nOn this Saturday, the lord de Pier-Yves, and his son the newly-elected\nbishop of Liege, as they were besieging Maestricht, learnt from their\nspies, that the two before-mentioned dukes were rapidly advancing\nagainst them, and burning the country on their line of march. They\ninstantly raised the siege, and retreated to the city of Liege with\nfull forty thousand combatants, where they fixed their quarters, Liege\nbeing only five leagues distant from Maestricht. The commanders there\nheld a council, with such of the inhabitants as had not been at the\nsiege; and at its close it was proclaimed through different parts of\nthe town, by orders of the governor and his son, the bishop, that every\nman capable of bearing arms should, on the morrow-morning, at the sound\nof a bell, be ready equipped to follow their commanders out of the town\nwhithersoever they might lead them.\n\nIn consequence of this order, on the morrow, the 22d day of September\n1408, there issued out of Liege, according to computation, about fifty\nthousand armed men. In this number were from five to six hundred well\narmed, in the french manner, on horseback, and from one hundred to six\nscore english archers, in their pay. They were followed by infinite\nnumbers of carts and other carriages, and a mob of people dressed in\nvarious manners, according to their own fancies.\n\nThe bell tolled at break of day, and they then sallied forth in good\narray, following their governor and bishop, very eager to offer combat\nto the enemy. Their governor had frequently warned them of the dangers\nthat might ensue from a battle, as their enemies were, for the greater\npart, nobles or gentlemen accustomed to war and obedience to their\ncommanders, which was not the case with them; and that it would be more\nto their advantage to remain within well-inclosed towns and castles\nharrassing the enemy by various means, and so tiring him out that he\nshould be forced to quit their country.\n\nThis advice, however, was not agreeable to the Liegeois, for it seemed\nto them that their numbers were so great that the enemy could not\nresist them; and they were not well pleased with what their governor\nhad told them. The governor, perceiving the Liegeois determined on\nbattle, led them into the plain, and drew them up in handsome array. He\nfrequently exhorted them to behave themselves valiantly, and with one\naccord, this day against the enemy, who was marching to attack them,\nand to defend with courage their lives and liberties.\n\nThey marched near to Tongres, which is five leagues distant from Liege,\nwhither the two dukes had advanced on the Saturday; for they had\nalready heard the siege of Maestricht was broken up, and that the men\nof Liege were intending to offer them battle. After some councils had\nbeen holden with the captains and the most experienced in their army,\nthey sent off, very early on the Sunday morning, two hundred light\ntroops, under the command of Robert le Roux and some other noblemen\nof the country, to inquire into the truth of what they had heard, and\nto see what the enemy was about. They shortly returned, and told the\ndukes, that the intelligence they had received was true, for that they\nhad seen the Liegeois in great numbers marching in battle-array. The\ndukes, on hearing this, commanded their men to arm, and to draw up in\norder of battle. When this was done, they marched to meet the Liegeois,\nand scarcely had they advanced half a league when they appeared in\nsight.\n\nThe Liegeois also saw them, for they were near to Tongres. Both armies\nadvancing, the dukes then posted themselves and all their infantry\non a very advantageous spot; and thinking the enemy would attempt to\ndislodge them, they formed their army into one battalion, the better to\nsupport the attack, and placed their baggage in their rear. They posted\nthe greater part of their archers and cross-bows on their right and\nleft as wings. The lord de Miraumont this day commanded the archers, by\norders of the duke of Burgundy, and with great credit to himself. The\nduke of Burgundy was on the right, and duke William on the left of the\narmy, each attended by his own people.\n\nAfter the proper orders had been given, and every arrangement made\naccording to the advice of the most experienced officers, very many\nnew knights were created. The men of Liege, swelled with pride, and\narrogantly considering the army of their opponents as infinitely\ninferior to them, marched on the right for an eminence called the\nheights of Hasbane, where they halted in handsome array. They had with\nthem the standard of St Lambert, and those of their different guilds;\nand the reason why they had halted on this spot was, that some of their\nold men had told them that it was there their ancestors had gained a\nvictory, and they flattered themselves with similar success.\n\nThey then formed their army in handsome order, and played off many\ncannons against their enemies, which annoyed them very much. It should\nbe known, that between the two armies was a narrow valley, at the\nbottom of which was a ditch to carry off the water in times of rain.\n\nThe two dukes having with their army remained stationary, observing\nthat the Liegeois did not seem inclined to quit their position, and\nbegin the battle, held a short council with their ablest officers,\nand thinking success was more likely to follow the most courageous,\ndetermined to advance slowly toward them in battle-array, on account of\nthe weight of their arms, and attack them where they were, before they\ncould fortify themselves, or increase their numbers by reinforcements.\n\nIn consequence, five hundred men at arms, on horseback, were ordered to\nattack the army of Liege on its rear, and about a thousand infantry,\nunder the command of the lords de Croy, de Helly, de Neufville and de\nRaise, knights, with Enguerrand de Bournouville, esquire, on the part\nof the duke of Burgundy; and by the lords de Hamette and de Ligne,\nknights, with Robert le Roux, esquire, who instantly advanced into the\nplain according to their orders.\n\nThe Liegeois, observing so large a detachment quit the duke\u2019s army,\nand march away, as it were, thought they were running off from fear\nof their great numbers, and began shouting, in their language, \u2018Fuyo,\nfuyo!\u2019 and repeating this word many times. The lord de Pier-Yves, the\ngovernor, like an able man, well versed in war, frequently, but gently,\nchecked them for making this noise, saying, \u2018My very dear friends,\nthat troop on horseback which you see, are not running away, as you\nsuppose; but when that other body of infantry, much greater, as you\nmay observe, shall be advanced near enough to begin the attack, those\non horseback will instantly wheel about, like skilful soldiers, and\ncharge your rear, with a design to divide your army, while the others\nshall attack you in front. Notwithstanding we have every appearance\nof a successful issue to our battle, I have always advised you to the\ncontrary; and though your hearts are set upon it, as if already sure\nof victory, I remain still in the same opinion,--because you are not\nso well used to warfare, nor armed like to your adversaries, who have\nlearnt all military exercises from their childhood. This was the reason\nwhy I proposed avoiding a battle; for it would have been more to your\nadvantage to have defended your towns and fortresses, and whenever a\nfavourable opportunity offered, to have fallen on your enemies, so that\nthey would have been forced to have quitted your country. However, the\nday you have so ardently wished for is now come; and I beg of you to\nput your hopes in God, and boldly and steadily exert yourselves in the\ndefence of your country against the enemy now marching to attack you.\u2019\n\nHaving finished this speech, he wanted to mount some of his most\ndetermined men on horseback to oppose the detachment then on the\nplain; but in truth the commonalty would not suffer it to be done, and\nuttered against him many reproaches, calling him a traitor.\n\nHe patiently suffered their rude ignorance, and hastily commanded the\narmy to be formed into a square, in the front of which was a body drawn\nup in the form of a triangle,--and the carts and baggage were towards\nthe rear, on the right and left of his army, handsomely arranged: their\nhorses were in the rear, on one of the wings, intermixed with their\narchers and cross-bows,--but they were of little value, except the\nenglish archers, who were better disposed of in other places.\n\nThe lord de Pier-Yves, accompanied by his son the bishop and some of\nhis best companions in arms, like a good commander, posted himself at\nthe head of his army, fronting the enemy.\n\nDuring this time, the two dukes began their march, gaily exhorting\ntheir men to behave themselves gallantly against the enemy, a rude\nand ignorant people, who had rebelled against their lord, and who\nconfidently trusted in their superior numbers for success,--telling\ntheir men, that if they acted as they expected they would, victory\nwould infallibly be theirs, and they would gain everlasting honour.\n\nWhen the dukes had made such like speeches, they retired to their\nposts, and under their banners, and advanced slowly toward the enemy,\nwho kept up a heavy fire against them with their cannons.\n\nThe banner-bearer of the duke of Burgundy was a very valiant knight,\ncalled sir James de Courtjambe, who, accidentally falling on his knees\nas he marched, alarmed many, who thought it was an unfavourable omen\nof their success; but he was soon raised by the help of those of his\nguard, and behaved himself honourably the whole day. This knight was a\nnative of Burgundy. The banner of duke William was that day borne by\na gallant knight, called sir Hoste d\u2019Escaussines, who behaved himself\nright well.\n\nWhen the two armies met, the conflict became very severe on each side,\nand lasted for upwards of an hour, when many deadly blows were given\nby both parties. At this moment, the detachment on horseback, with\nthe infantry, according to their orders, advanced to the rear of the\nLiegeois; but from the position of their baggage-waggons, they had\nmuch difficulty to force their way. At length, by dint of courage, they\nsucceeded, and, having gained an entrance, began to lay about them so\nvigorously that the army of the enemy was divided,--and they saw full\nsix thousand Liegeois quit their ranks, with their guns and the banners\nof their guilds, and take flight with all speed towards a village half\na league from the field of battle.\n\nWhen the detachment perceived this, they left off the attack they had\nbegun, and pursued the runaways, whom they charged, not once, but\nseveral times, beating down and slaying them without mercy,--and, in\nshort, routed them so effectually that, through fear of death, they\nfled here and there, into woods and other places, to hide themselves.\n\nThis party of the Liegeois being either killed, dispersed, or taken\nprisoners, the horsemen returned to their main body, gallantly fighting\nthe enemy, who, it must be said, defended themselves courageously. In\ntruth, the event of this battle was some time doubtful,--for, during\none half hour, it could not be known which side would be victorious.\nThe noise of their war-cries was frightful:--the Burgundians and\nHainaulters shouted under their banners, \u2018Our Lady for Burgundy! Our\nLady for Hainault!\u2019 and the Liegeois, in their turn, shouted, \u2018St\nLambert for Pier-Yves!\u2019\n\nThe men of Liege would perhaps have conquered, if this detachment on\nhorseback, when returned from the defeat of the runaways, had not again\nfallen on their rear, and behaved so marvellously well that those who\nopposed them were pierced through, and all attempts to check them were\nvain. A great slaughter was made by them in a short time, for none were\nadmitted to ransom; and by their vigour whole ranks fell one over the\nother, for now all the weight and power of the infantry were brought\nagainst them.\n\nThe defeat once begun, there were such heaps of dead and wounded that\nit was melancholy to behold, for they were thicker in many places than\nstooks of corn in harvest. This ought not to occasion surprise; for\nwhen the common people are assembled, badly armed, and puffed up with\ntheir extravagant desires, although they be in great numbers, yet shall\nthey hardly be able to resist an army composed of noblemen well tried\nin arms, even when God shall permit it so to be. At this period of\nthe battle, and near to the banner of the duke of Burgundy, where the\nconflict was the strongest, fell the lord de Pierre-Yves and his two\nsons,--namely, the one who had been elected bishop of Liege and his\nbrother: they were instantly put to death.\n\nThe heir of Salmes[6], who bore the standard of St Lambert, namely,\nthe eldest son to the count de Salmes[6], who was in the army of the\ntwo dukes; sir John Collet, and many other knights and esquires to\nthe amount of upwards of five hundred; all the english archers, and\nabout twenty-eight thousand of the commonalty, were left dead on the\nfield,--and more perished by arrow-shots than by any other weapon.\n\nSir Baldwin de Montgardin, knight, to save his life, surrendered\nhimself to the duke of Burgundy:--he was led out of the engagement, and\nafterward given by the duke to sir Wicart de Bours.\n\nI have no need to particularise the great courage and coolness of the\nduke of Burgundy, nor how he galloped to different parts of the army,\nexhorting them to act well,--nor how, until the end of the battle,\nhe most gallantly behaved himself,--for in truth, his conduct was\nsuch that he was praised and spoken of by all knights and others;\nand although he was frequently covered with arrows and other missile\nweapons, he did not on that day lose one drop of blood.\n\nWhen he was asked after the defeat, if they should cease from slaying\nthe Liegeois, he replied, \u2018Let them all die together! for I will not\nthat any prisoners be made, nor that any be ransomed!!\u2019\n\nIn the like gallant manner did duke William, the other princes, and in\ngeneral the whole body of the chivalry and nobility of the two dukes\nbehave themselves. There were slain from five to six hundred of their\nmen; and among the number were, John de la Chapelle, knight to the\nabove duke,--sir Flourimont de Brimeu, John de la Trimouille, who on\nthis day had been made a knight,--Hugotin de Nambon, John de Theune,\nviscount de Brimequet, a native of Hainault,--Rollant de la Mote, and\nothers, to the amount of one hundred and six score gentlemen: the rest\nwere varlets[7].\n\nJust as the dukes had gained the victory, about two thousand men made\na sally from Tongres, to assist the Liegemen. When they saw they were\ndefeated, they retreated to their town, but were so closely pursued by\nthe body of horse that had done such essential service that very many\nof them were killed.\n\nThe two dukes, seeing their victory was now complete, met, and returned\nthanks to the Creator, congratulating with one another for their\nsuccess. They had tents pitched on the field of battle, and remained\nthere for three days and three nights.\n\nThe french ambassadors, having now taken their leave, departed for\nTournay, and continued their road to Paris to the king and his council;\nbut prior to their departure, the duke of Burgundy had dispatched a\nmessenger to the king of France, with letters to inform him and his\ngood friends in Paris of the fortunate event of the battle. This news\nwas not very agreeable to many who were intending to urge the king\nto prosecute the duke of Burgundy for the murder of the late duke of\nOrleans,--and on the contrary, it gave great joy to his friends.\n\nOn Monday, the morrow of the battle, about the hour of twelve, John\nof Bavaria, bishop of Liege, attended by the heir of Heinseberg, and\nseveral others, nobles and not nobles, to the number of six hundred\nhelmets, or thereabout, came from the town of Maestricht, wherein\nthey had been besieged, to the camp of the two dukes, and most humbly\nthanked them for the succour they had afforded him. He and his party\nwere received with much joy; and, on his arrival, he was presented with\nthe head of the lord de Pier-Yves, which had been found among the dead,\nwith his two sons, and was fixed to the top of a lance, that all who\npleased might see it!\n\nOn the following Tuesday, the feast of St Fremin, a martyr, the\ninhabitants of Liege, Huy, Dinant and Tongres, and of all the other\ngood towns in the bishoprick of Liege, excepting the castle of\nBouillon, hearing of the great destruction of their countrymen, and the\npower of their enemies, were panic-struck, and, seeing no probability\nof any assistance, surrendered themselves to the obedience of the dukes\nof Burgundy and of Holland. They sent to them ambassadors to this\neffect, and also to supplicate John of Bavaria, their bishop and lord,\nthat he would graciously have pity upon them, and grant them his pardon.\n\nThe bishop, through the intercession of the two dukes, complied with\ntheir request, on condition that such as had been most active in\npromoting the rebellion, many of whom were still alive, whose names\nthey would set down, should be given up to the two dukes, to do by them\nas they in their justice should think right; and each of the towns gave\nsufficient hostages for the due performance of the terms.\n\nOn the ensuing Thursday, the two dukes and the bishop, with the whole\narmy, broke up the camp, and advanced toward the town of Liege. The\nduke of Burgundy was quartered in the town of Flauye, on the river\nMeuse, one league distant from Liege, and duke William among the\nmountains.\n\nOn the following Sunday, the dukes and the bishop held a full council,\nto which all their ministers were admitted, on the present state of\naffairs. Other councils were continued until the Tuesday, when the\nbishop made his entry into Liege, and was received with great humility\nby the remnant of its inhabitants. The most culpable in the late\nrebellion had been before arrested and thrown into prison in this and\nin all the other towns.\n\nThe bishop went first to the cathedral church of St Lambert to offer\nhis prayers, and reconcile himself with the chapter: after this he went\nto his palace, when he was most humbly entreated by the people to have\nmercy on them, which he granted; and, shortly after, he returned to the\ncamp of the two dukes.\n\nAbout two o\u2019clock in the afternoon, on the morrow, the dukes and the\nbishop, with several nobles of the army, assembled on an elevated spot\nnear the camp, whither sir John de Jeumont, marshal to duke William,\nby the commands of the two dukes and the bishop, had ordered the heir\nof Rochefort, a rich nobleman, John de Saramie[8], knight, and fifteen\nother citizens, to be brought from the town, and had their heads cut\noff, one after another, by the executioner. Many churchmen, and some\nwomen, were also drowned in the Meuse for having been concerned in the\nrebellion!\n\nOn the morrow, the dukes and the bishop moved with the army to a town\nthree leagues distant, called Beaucloquet, where many conferences\nwere held, on the state of the country. The count de Nevers joined\nhis brother, the duke of Burgundy, at this place, with four hundred\ncombatants. Hither also sir John de Jeumont ordered nineteen citizens\nfrom the town of Huy to be brought, who underwent a similar punishment\nto those of Liege, and for the same cause; and, as before, many\nchurchmen and women were drowned[9].\n\nAm\u00e9 de Viry, a Savoyard, a nobleman well experienced in war, came\nhither also to aid the duke of Burgundy, and accompanied by three\nhundred helmets from that country. When the dukes and the bishop had\nfor several days consulted together on the affairs of Liege, it was at\nlength concluded, with the approbation of John of Bavaria, now surnamed\nJohn the Pitiless, that they should all meet again in the city of\nTournay, on St Luke\u2019s day next ensuing, to determine finally on the\nmeasures to be pursued touching these matters.\n\nAfter many executions had taken place in the bishoprick of Liege\non those who had been concerned in the rebellion, and when the\nfortifications of the towns of Huy, Dinant and others, had been\ndestroyed, the two dukes began their march homeward, taking with them\na number of persons from Liege, who had been given as hostages for the\nobservance of all the articles of the treaty that should be made with\nthem. Some of them were sent by duke William to Mons and Valenciennes,\nand some to Lille, Arras, and other places belonging to the duke of\nBurgundy, who went to his county of Flanders, and duke William to\nHainault, after they had disbanded their men at arms. The greater part\nreturned to their homes much enriched by the plunder of the Liegeois,\nwho, thunderstruck by the misfortune that had befallen them, became\nstupified and indolent.\n\nMany great lords attended the duke of Burgundy on this expedition:\namong them were, from Burgundy, sir John de Ch\u00e2lons[10], sir Gaultier\nde Ruples, the lord de Vergy[11], marshal of Burgundy, the lord de St\nGeorge, sir John de la Balme[12], sir William de Champ-divers, sir\nJames de Courtjambe, the lord de Montagu, and many more. From Picardy,\nthe lords de Croy[13], de Heilly, de Fosseux, de Vaurin, sir Bort\nGuieret and his brothers, the lord of Inchy, the lord of Raisse, the\nlord de Brimeu, sir Regnault de Crequy lord of Comtes[14], Enguerrand\nde Bournouville, the lord de Ront, sir Raoul de Flandres, the lord de\nPoix, sir Wincart de Bours, the lord d\u2019Auxy, the lord de Mailly, the\nlord de Thiennes and the lord d\u2019Azincourt. From Flanders, sir John and\nsir Louis de Guystelle, the lord de Hames, sir John de Bailleul, sir\nCollart de Fosseux, and others, the principal nobles of the country.\n\nIn like manner, duke William had assembled his nobles, with many\nothers, his allies; among whom was sir John de Bethune, brother to the\nviscount de Meaux. Common report said, that Anthony duke of Brabant,\nbrother to the duke of Burgundy, and Waleran de Luxembourg count\nde St Pol, had refused their assistance, because they had not been\nmade acquainted with the terms and agreements entered into by John\nof Bavaria on the one part, and the lord de Pier-Yves on the other,\nfor the resignation of the bishoprick of Liege. They also made other\nexcuses.\n\nWhen the day appointed for the meeting of the duke of Burgundy, duke\nWilliam and the bishop of Liege, in the town of Tournay, for the final\nsettlement of the affairs of Liege drew near, the inhabitants of\nthat town sent them a petition, by ambassadors chosen from among the\nprincipal citizens, to request they would fix on some other town, as\nthe numbers of their attendants would greatly harrass and impoverish\nthem, considering the very small stock of provision that was in\nTournay. Their request was granted,--and the town of Lille was chosen\nfor their meeting on the day that had before been fixed on.\n\nThither all the hostages from Liege were conducted, and brought into\nthe presence of the aforesaid dukes and bishop, with several more that\nhad been deputed to hear what judgment should be given, which was as\nfollows:\n\n\u2018The dukes of Burgundy and Holland declare, that this their judgment\nshall be punctually fulfilled in every respect, with regard to the\npresent time, reserving to themselves the power of making any future\nalterations in it as often as, and in what manner, they shall please.\n\n\u2018First, They consent that the inhabitants of Liege, of the towns and\ncountry of that bishoprick, situated within the district of Liege,\nthe country of Los, the countries of Hasbane, St Tron, the territory\nof Bouillon, shall enjoy their customary franchises and privileges.\nThey order, that the citizens of Liege, and of the other towns above\nnamed, do bring to the monastery des Escolliers, in the town of Mons\nin Hainault, on the morrow of Martinmas-day next ensuing, all the\nletters patent and charters of their laws and privileges, which they\npossess,--which they will deliver into the hands of such as may be\ncommissioned by the said dukes to receive them. Those who bring them\nshall make oath, on the salvation of their own souls, and of the souls\nof them who sent them, that they have not fraudulently left behind any\ncharters of their laws and privileges.\n\n\u2018Item, the dukes aforesaid declare, that should the city of Liege, or\nany other town, neglect to send, or fraudulently retain, any of their\ncharters, that town so retaining them shall be for ever deprived of its\nprivileges and particular laws.\n\n\u2018Item, the lords aforesaid will, that these charters and letters\npatent be delivered to the commissioners punctually on the morrow of\nMartinmas-day.\n\n\u2018Item, they likewise ordain, that when these charters and privileges\nshall have been duly examined, and new ones drawn up and delivered,\nneither the bishop of Liege nor his chapter shall grant any new\nprivileges to the inhabitants, without the consent of the two dukes or\ntheir successors.\n\n\u2018Item, they also ordain, that henceforward the commonalty shall not\nappoint or nominate, in the aforesaid towns and bishoprick, any\nofficers, such as governors, masters of trades, doctors of arts,--but\nthat from this day all such offices be annulled.\n\n\u2018Item, they ordain, that all bailiffs, provosts, mayors, and others\nbearing similar titles, shall be nominated by the bishop of Liege\nand the count de Los;--and also, that the sheriffs in such towns as\nclaim the right of shrievalty shall be renewed yearly, and a certain\nnumber appointed according to the exigency of the case and size of the\ntowns. In no large town shall father and son, two brothers-in-law, two\ncousins-german, the uncle and nephew, nor anyone who has married the\nmother of another, be appointed sheriffs at the same time, in order\nthat no improper favours be shewn from partiality of kindred. All\nofficers shall swear solemnly on their creation, to preserve and abide\nby every article and point contained in the constitution delivered to\nthem.\n\n\u2018Item, they ordain, that the bishop of Liege may, each year, at the\nexpiration of the shrievalty, appoint such sheriffs as he shall please,\nor re-appoint those of the preceding year, or others according to his\ngood pleasure, provided they are not any way connected by blood, as\nhas been before mentioned. All disputes respecting the persons or\nfortunes of the inhabitants of the different towns having sheriffs,\nshall be brought before their jurisdictions,--and at the end of the\nyear, the sheriffs shall be bound to render an account of their\nadministration before their lord, the bishop of Liege, or his deputies,\nand before one commissary deputed by the chapter, and another on the\npart of the different churches.\n\n\u2018Item, they ordain, that all guilds and fraternities in the city of\nLiege, and in all the other towns, shall henceforth cease and be\nannulled; and that the banners of the above guilds in Liege shall be\ndelivered up to commissaries, on an appointed day that shall be made\nknown to them; and the banners of the other towns shall be brought\nby the inhabitants to a certain place on an appointed day, to the\ncommissioners named to receive them, and who shall do with them as they\nmay judge expedient.\n\n\u2018Item, they also ordain, that in the above city, and in the towns\nwithin the said bishoprick, no one shall be reputed a citizen unless\nhe shall have really resided within such town in which he shall claim\nhis right of citizenship. And all such rights of citizenship are for\nthe present annulled; for although there may be resident citizens in\nthe aforesaid towns, they cannot, in such right, claim any moveables by\nreason of inheritance, without the cognizance of the lords under whom\nsuch persons have lived, and in whose territory such inheritances are\nsituated.\n\n\u2018Item, they ordain, that from this moment, and in times to come, the\ntowns of Huy, Dinant, and others within the territory of Liege, the\ncountry of Los, the country of Hasbane, and all within the jurisdiction\nof Liege, shall no longer call together any assembly, or congregation\nof people, under pretence of holding councils or otherwise, without the\nconsent of their aforesaid bishop and lord, or of the chapter of Liege,\nshould the bishoprick at the time be vacant.\n\n\u2018Item, they ordain, that the bishop of Liege, or any others having the\ngovernment of the said territory and its dependancies, shall never bear\narms against the king or kings of France, their successors; nor against\nthe two said dukes, their successors in the said duchies and counties;\nnor against the count de Namur for the time being, or his successors;\nnor against any of the countries, of the aforesaid, except when ordered\nby the emperor, and only when the emperor shall be himself present:\nprovided, nevertheless, that the king of France and the above-mentioned\npersons do not invade the territories of the bishop and chapter of\nLiege.\n\n\u2018Item, they likewise ordain, that in perpetual remembrance of this\nvictory, and the conquest made over them by the above two dukes, they\nand their successors shall have a free passage, whenever they may\nchoose to cross the river Meuse, through all towns in the territory of\nLiege, fortified or not, and with a body of men at arms or with few\nattendants according to their pleasure,--provided they do not permit\nany of the inhabitants of the said towns, villages, or country through\nwhich they shall pass, to be any way molested by their men,--and\nprovisions shall be found them for their money, without demanding\nhigher prices for the articles than they are usually sold for.\n\n\u2018Item, they ordain, that the coin of the aforesaid dukes and their\nsuccessors shall have free currency throughout the territories and\ndependancies of the bishop and chapter of Liege.\n\n\u2018Item, they ordain, that a chapel shall be erected on the spot where\nthe last victory was gained, and funds allotted for the support of four\nchaplains and two priests; and the said chapels shall be furnished\nwith chasubles, chalices, and other ornaments for celebrating mass\nand such other divine services as shall be thought advisable for the\neternal welfare of the souls of those who were slain in that battle.\nThe nomination to the above benefices shall remain with the two dukes,\naccording to regulations which they shall hereafter make between\nthemselves,--the Liegeois only to be once at the expense of providing\nthis chapel with sacred vessels and ornaments. The bishop of Liege\nshall allot from his revenues two hundred golden crowns of annual rent\nfor the support of the four chaplains and two priests; that is to say,\nfor each chaplain forty crowns, for each priest ten crowns, and for the\nrepairs of the chapel twenty crowns.\n\n\u2018Item, the said dukes will, that on the twenty-third day of every month\nof September, on which day the battle took place, a mass shall be\ncelebrated to the blessed Virgin, with great solemnity, by the provost\nor dean of the church of St Lambert, in Liege, who shall chaunt it in\nthe choir and at the grand altar, in commemoration of this victory,\nand for the welfare of the souls of those who fell in battle. The same\nshall be required of all the churches and chapels to monasteries, as\nwell for men as women, within the said town of Liege, as of all others\nwithin its jurisdiction.\n\n\u2018Item, the said dukes require from the bishop of Liege and the chapter,\nthat they strictly enjoin such services to be regularly performed on\nevery twenty-third day of September throughout the diocese; and that\nall priests, after the performing of this service, shall be suffered\npeaceably to return to their homes.\n\n\u2018Item, they ordain, that the bishop of Liege and his successors, and\nsuch as may have the government of the country in times of a vacancy\nin the see, and the members of the chapter of Liege, shall appoint\nsuch governor of the castle of Huy as they shall approve of: in which\ncastle, likewise, they shall not place a greater garrison, nor more\nstores of provision, than they shall judge expedient, like as an\nupright lord shall determine. They also insist on having a free ingress\nand regress into and from the town of Huy and the adjacent country.\nThey likewise ordain the same regulations respecting the castles of\nEscoquehen[15] and Bouillon, as to their governors, garrisons and\nstores.\n\n\u2018Item, the aforesaid dukes ordain, that should any one, however\nhigh his rank, attempt, by force, or otherwise, to deprive those of\nsuch gifts and preferments in the church, or any other offices for\nlife, as have been usually granted by the bishops of Liege and their\npredecessors, the members of the chapter of Liege shall be bound to\nrestore, and defend them in, their possessions to the utmost of their\npower, without any fraud whatever.\n\n\u2018Item, as there are still living many perverse conspirators, who are\nnow fugitives from the territories of Liege and county of Los, and\nhave retired into the neighbouring countries, where they have been\nreceived, the dukes aforesaid will appoint proper commissioners to\nmake inquiry whither such wicked persons have gone, and publish their\nnames. On the discovery of the places to which they have withdrawn,\napplications shall be made to the princes and lords thereof, that they\nmay be surrendered to the bishop of Liege, for him to inflict on them\nthe punishments due to their deserts, or at least that such princes\nand lords may drive them out of their respective countries. But should\nthese lords refuse to comply, or to do justice on such conspirators,\nthey shall be for ever banished from the bishoprick of Liege, the\ncounty of Los, and their dependancies, as conspirators and movers of\nsedition; and it shall be proclaimed throughout the above countries,\nthat no one receive them within their houses, but deliver them up\nto justice, should any attempt to return, demanding assistance from\ntheir lord, should there be a necessity for it. Should they be unable\nto arrest them, they shall denounce them to the nearest officers of\njustice, under pain of suffering corporal punishment, and having their\nfortunes confiscated, as would have been done to such conspirators\nand rebels. While exerting themselves in the performance of this\nduty, should they accidentally put to death any of such rebels, no\nconsequences shall ensue to their loss.\n\n\u2018Item, they ordain that the walls of the castle of Thuin, with its\ngates and towers, be razed, as well the part toward the town as that\ntoward the mountain, and the ditches filled up.\n\n\u2018Item, the same to be done to the town of Fosse and to the town\nand castle of Commun,--which towns shall not be repaired. And in\nlike manner shall all the posts on the river Sambre be destroyed,\nthe ditches filled, and neither they nor the towns shall be ever\nagain repaired, so that they may serve for places of defence to the\ninhabitants, on any pretence, in future times.\n\n\u2018Item, the gates, walls and towers of Dinant shall be pulled down, as\nwell on the opposite side of the Meuse as on this; and the inhabitants\nshall never rebuild them again.\n\n\u2018Item, the inhabitants of the said towns of Thuin, Fosse, Commun and\nDinant, or any persons from other towns, shall not rebuild or repair\nthe fortified places between or on the two rivers Sambre and Meuse, on\nthe road to Namur.\n\n\u2018Item, one of the gates of Tongres shall also be razed, namely, that\nwhich leads to Maestricht, with forty feet of wall on each side of the\nsaid gate, without a possibility of its ever being re-erected. The town\nof Tongres shall likewise, at its own expense, cause to be filled up\nthe trenches they had opened before the said town, when they besieged\ntheir lord within it, because they had put the country of Liege under\nheavy taxes, and had subjugated it.\n\n\u2018And whereas it is notorious, that very great losses have attended this\nsubjugation, the aforesaid dukes will, that an aid be levied on this\ncity, and the towns before mentioned, to the amount of two hundred and\ntwenty thousand golden crowns, which shall be raised as soon as may be,\nbeing levied in proportion to the comparative riches of each inhabitant.\n\n\u2018Item, in case any of the hostages shall die before all the articles\nof this treaty are completed, the aforesaid lords will, that the town\nor district whence such hostage or hostages shall have been sent, do\ninstantly furnish others of the same rank and property as those who\nhave died.\n\n\u2018Item, they ordain, that when this treaty shall be properly engrossed,\nthe bishop of Liege, his chapter, and the principal inhabitants, shall\ncome to sign it, and engage, that should any articles of it be not\ncompleted according to the exact tenor of the terms, then for each\nomission or neglect the bishop, his successors, the chapter and chief\ntowns shall forfeit two hundred thousand golden crowns of the coin of\nthe king of France, or other florins of gold of France, of the value\nof the aforesaid crowns. That is to say, fifty thousand to the then\nemperor or king of the Romans; to the king of France fifty thousand;\nand to each of the said dukes the like sum;--the whole to be levied on\nthe lands and moveables of the said Liegeois, by seizure of their goods\nand bodies wherever they may be.\n\n\u2018They are likewise to signify their consent, that should obstacles be\nthrown in the way by any of the said towns to prevent the articles\nof the said treaty from being carried into effect, the bishop of\nLiege, and the archbishop of Cologne for the time being, shall be the\narbitrators between such towns,--and their decision shall be final.\n\n\u2018When a legal pope shall be elected, and his authority over the whole\nchurch of God be acknowledged, then such as make opposition to the\nexecution of the above treaty shall be laid under an interdict, which\nshall not be taken off, until sufficient reparation be made, and the\naforesaid pecuniary forfeitures be paid.\n\n\u2018Should any of the towns, or their inhabitants, offer any insult, in\ncontradiction to the above treaty, to either of the said dukes or\ntheir successors, the bishop of Liege, or his vicar in his absence,\nthe chapter and citizens shall be required to constrain the offenders\nto make full reparation within one month from the time of complaint\nbeing made. And should such reparation not be made within the month,\nas aforesaid, after the summons to that effect has been delivered, the\ncountry shall be liable to the same fines as before mentioned.\n\n\u2018The dukes of Burgundy and of Holland order, that all these articles be\nfairly engrossed, and then sealed with their seals, and then given to\nthe lord bishop of Liege, or to his chapter, with a copy for the city\nof Liege and one for each principal town. In return, the bishop and the\ntowns shall give to the dukes aforesaid letters signed with their great\nseals acknowledging the receipt of the above treaty, and promising\nobedience to all the articles of it, and binding themselves to the\nfines therein mentioned.\n\n\u2018As many noble persons and others, as well secular as ecclesiastic,\nhave presented many petitions to complain of the great losses they have\nsuffered during the late rebellion, and specifying their particular\ngrievances,--the dukes aforesaid, not having had time to examine them\nwith the attention they deserve, will have them examined with all\npossible speed, and will attend to each of them.\u2019\n\nThe whole of the above, having been written out fair, was, by the\ncommand of the two dukes aforesaid, publicly proclaimed in the great\nhall at Lille, and in their presence, the 24th day of October, in the\nyear 1408.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. IV.\n\n    THE KING OF FRANCE HOLDS A GRAND COUNCIL AT PARIS, TO CONSIDER\n    ON THE MANNER OF PROCEEDING AGAINST THE DUKE OF BURGUNDY FOR\n    THE MURDER OF THE DUKE OF ORLEANS.\n\n\nDuring the expedition of the duke of Burgundy against the Liegeois, a\ngreat many of the principal lords were, by the king\u2019s orders, assembled\nat Paris. Among them were, Louis king of Sicily, Charles king of\nNavarre, the duke of Brittany, the duke of Bourbon, and several others,\nthe greater part of whom were friendly to the duchess-dowager of\nOrleans and her children in their prosecution of the duke of Burgundy.\nMany councils were held as to the manner in which the king should\nproceed against the duke of Burgundy, who was the principal actor in\nthis murder, as has been before explained.\n\nIt was at length determined in these councils, that a most rigorous\nprosecution, in conformity to the laws, should be carried on against\nhim; and should he refuse to obey, the king, with all his subjects\nand vassals, should march, with as great a force as could be raised,\nagainst him, to bring him and his abettors to due obedience.\n\nAt the same time, at the solicitations of the duchess of Orleans\nand her children, the king annulled all his letters of pardon which\nhe had formerly granted to the duke of Burgundy, and declared them\nof no weight, in the presence of the queen, the duke of Acquitaine,\nthe princes of the blood, and the whole of the council. The duchess\ndemanded and obtained letters, confirming this renunciation of the\npardon; after which, she and her daughter-in-law, wife to the young\nduke of Orleans, left Paris, and returned to Blois.\n\nNot long after this, news came to Paris of the great victory which\nthe duke of Burgundy had gained over the Liegeois. This was confirmed\nby the return of the king\u2019s ambassadors, sir Guichard Daulphin and\nsir William de Tignonville, who, as has been related, were present at\nthe battle, and gave to the king and the lords then in Paris a most\ncircumstantial account of it. On hearing this, several who had been\nmost violent against the duke of Burgundy, now hung their heads, and\nbegan to be of a contrary opinion to what they had before held, fearing\nthe steadiness, boldness and power of the duke, who was said to have a\nmind equal to the support of any misfortunes that should happen to him,\nand which would encourage him to oppose and conquer all attempts of his\nadversaries. In short, all the measures that had been adopted against\nhim were dropped, and the men at arms were ordered to return to the\nplaces whence they had come.\n\nAmbassadors had arrived from England to treat of a peace, or a truce\nfor one year, between the kings of England and of France, which having\nobtained, they set out on their return, through Amiens and Boulogne,\nto Calais. On the road, they heard of the grand victory of the duke\nof Burgundy, which surprised them very much,--and they gave him the\nsurname of \u2018Jean sans peur.\u2019\n\nThe duke of Burgundy was very active in attaching to his party noblemen\nand warriors from all countries, to strengthen himself against his\nenemies, of whom he was given to understand that he had many. He\nheld on this subject several consultations with his two brothers and\nbrothers-in-law, namely, duke William of Holland and John of Bavaria,\nto which were admitted his most trusty friends; and they deliberated\nlong on the manner in which he should now carry himself. It was at\nlength finally concluded, that he should openly oppose all, excepting\nthe king of France and the duke of Acquitaine; and those present\npromised him aid and support with all the power of their vassals, on\nthese terms.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. V.\n\n    THE KING OF FRANCE IS CARRIED, BY THE PRINCES OF THE BLOOD,\n    TO TOURS IN TOURAINE.----PEACE IS MADE IN THE TOWN OF\n    CHARTRES.--THE DEATH OF THE DOWAGER DUCHESS OF ORLEANS.\n\n\nThe king of France left Paris, accompanied by the kings of Sicily and\nNavarre, the queen, the duke of Acquitaine, the dukes of Berry and\nBourbon, who, with others of the blood-royal, conducted him, under\nthe escort of a large body of men at arms, to Tours in Touraine, as\nhis place of residence,--to the great displeasure of the inhabitants\nof Paris, who were so much troubled thereat that they barricadoed the\nstreets with chains. They hastily sent to inform the duke of Burgundy,\nat Lille, of the king\u2019s departure, giving him to understand that the\ngreater part of those who had carried him away from Paris were not well\ninclined towards him.\n\nThis intelligence was not very agreeable to the duke, for he suspected\nthat the king had only been conducted to Tours that his enemies might\ncarry their measures against him more securely; for the lords who had\nthe government knew well that the Parisians loved the duke of Burgundy,\nand would not that any other should have the government of the kingdom,\nbelieving, from the hints he had thrown out, that when in power he\nwould abolish all gabelles and other taxes which oppressed the people.\n\nThe duke of Burgundy first consulted the dukes of Brabant and of\nHolland, and other steady friends, and then remanded his men at arms\nfrom Burgundy, who were on their march to their own country from Liege,\nand assembled another body from various parts. He advanced to Roye, in\nthe Vermandois, where he mustered his men, and then marched them toward\nParis. He quartered himself, on the 23d day of November, in the town of\nSt Denis, and his forces in the adjacent country. On the morrow, as he\nwas advancing with his men at arms in array toward Paris, two thousand\nor more combatants sallied out thence, and conducted him, with every\nmark of honour, to his h\u00f4tel of Artois.\n\nMany of the Parisians sung carols in the squares, although all\nrejoicings had been strictly forbidden on his arrival, to avoid\nincreasing the envy of the princes of the blood. Some of the king\u2019s\nservants said to those who were singing carols, \u2018You may otherwise\nshow your joy for his arrival, but you ought not thus to sing.\u2019\nNotwithstanding this, all the principal citizens, and those in\nauthority, showed him as much honour and respect as if he had been king\nhimself.\n\nA few days afterward, duke William, count of Hainault, arrived at\nParis, well accompanied by unarmed men, and, at the request of the\nduke of Burgundy, set out for Tours, attended by the lords de Croy,\nde St George, de la Viefville, d\u2019Olhaz, and others of the council of\nthe duke, to negotiate his peace with the king, and the lords who had\ncarried him from Paris. The count of Hainault was most honourably\nreceived at Tours by the king, the queen, and the other great lords;\nfor the marriage had taken place between John duke of Touraine, second\nson to the king, and the daughter of the duke of Burgundy: he was also\nnearly related to the queen.\n\nOn the conclusion of the feasts made on his arrival, the count of\nHainault and those who had accompanied him opened, in full council,\nthe business of their mission, namely, to make peace for the duke\nof Burgundy. After many discussions, it was resolved, that the king\nshould send certain persons, selected by him, to hold a conference with\nthe duke of Burgundy at Paris, and point out to him the means of his\nregaining the good graces of the king.\n\nDuke Louis of Bavaria, brother to the queen, Montagu grand master of\nthe king\u2019s household, and other experienced counsellors, were nominated\nfor this purpose; and they returned with the count de Hainault to\nParis, when what had passed was told to the duke of Burgundy.\n\nAs all the circumstances of this treaty were not agreeable to the duke,\nand as he had many suspicions respecting Montagu, he was not disposed\nto receive the negotiators in the way they were sent to him. He even\npersonally made many reproaches to Montagu, who bore them patiently,\nexcusing himself for any thing that had passed. The treaty, however,\nhaving been altered and corrected, was sent back to the king at Tours,\nand in the end agreed to in the manner you shall hear.\n\nWhile these negotiations were going forward, and before their\nconclusion, the duchess-dowager of Orleans, daughter to Galeazzo duke\nof Milan, died in the town of Blois, broken-hearted at not having been\nable to obtain justice from the king and council against the duke of\nBurgundy for the murder of her late lord and husband, Louis duke of\nOrleans. The duke of Burgundy was much rejoiced at this event, for the\nduchess had bitterly carried on her prosecution against him.\n\nHer heart was buried at Paris, near that of her husband, and her body\nin the church of the canons at Blois. After her death, Charles, her\neldest son, was duke of Orleans and of Valois, count of Blois and of\nBeaumont, lord of Coni and of Ast, with many other lordships:--Philip,\nthe second son, was count of Vertus,--and John, the youngest, was named\ncount of Angoul\u00eame. These three brothers, and one sister, thus became\norphans, but they had been very well educated; yet, by the deaths of\nthe duke and duchess of Orleans, they were much weakened in support\nand advice,--and several of the king\u2019s ministers were not so zealous\nto prosecute the duke of Burgundy as they had been. This was very\napparent in the negotiations which took place some little time after\nthe death of the duchess, between the duke of Burgundy and the children\nof Orleans; for although the treaty sent by the king was not wholly to\nthe liking of the duke, as has been said, yet it was so corrected that\nthe parties accepted of it, in the following terms:\n\nFirst, it was ordered by the king and his great council, that the duke\nof Burgundy should depart from Paris with his men at arms, and return\nto his own country, where he was to remain until a certain day, namely,\nthe first Wednesday in February, when he was to meet the king at the\ntown of Chartres, accompanied only by one hundred gentlemen at arms,\nand the children of Orleans with fifty. It was also ordered, that duke\nWilliam, count of Hainault, should have under his command four hundred\nof the king\u2019s men at arms, to preserve the peace. It was also ordered,\nthat the duke of Burgundy, when he appeared before the king, should be\nattended by one of his council, who should repeat the words he was to\nsay; and the duke, in confirmation of them, was to add, \u2018We will and\nagree that it should be thus.\u2019\n\nAfterward, according to the tenor of the treaty, the king was to say to\nthe duke of Burgundy, \u2018We will, that the count de Vertus, our nephew,\nhave one of your daughters in marriage.\u2019 The duke was by this treaty to\nassign over to his daughter three thousand livres parisis yearly, and\ngive her one hundred and fifty thousand golden francs.\n\nWhen this treaty had been concluded, duke William set out from Paris\nfor Hainault; and shortly after, the duke of Burgundy disbanded his men\nat arms, and left Paris to go to Lille, whither he had summoned the\nduke of Brabant his brother, duke William and the bishop of Liege, his\nbrothers-in-law, and many other great lords.\n\nAt this period, there was a great quarrel between the duke of Brabant\nand duke William. It was caused by the father of duke William having\nborrowed in former times from the late duchess of Brabant one hundred\nand fifty thousand florins to carry on a war against some of his\nrebellious subjects in Holland, which sum the duke of Brabant had\nclaimed as belonging to him. He had in consequence, by the advice\nof his Brabanters, taken possession of a castle called Heusden[16],\nsituated between Brabant and Holland.\n\nThe duke of Burgundy took great pains to make up the quarrel between\nthese two princes, that they might the more effectually assist him in\nhis plans, which were very extensive. After this business had been\nsettled, and the parties had separated, duke William assembled in\nHainault, according to the king of France\u2019s orders, four hundred men\nat arms and as many archers. The principal lords among them were, the\ncounts de Namur, de Conversant and de Salmes. The duke of Burgundy,\nconformably to the treaty, set out, the day after Ash-Wednesday,\nattended by his son-in-law the count de Penthievre[17], and lay at\nBapaume. Thence he went to Paris, with duke William, the above-named\nlords, the count de St Pol, the count de Vaudemont[18], and several\nothers of the nobility.\n\nOn Saturday, the 2d day of March, they arrived all together at the\ntown of Gallardon, four leagues distant from Chartres. The Wednesday\nfollowing, duke William of Holland advanced with his body of forces to\nChartres, where the king then was. On the ensuing Saturday, the duke\nof Burgundy set out from Gallardon, to wait on the king, escorted by\nsix hundred men at arms; but when he approached Chartres, he dismissed\nthem all, excepting one hundred light horsemen, in compliance with the\ntreaty, and thus entered Chartres about ten o\u2019clock in the morning,\nriding strait to the church as far as the cloisters of the canons,\nwhere he was lodged.\n\nAt this same time, the duke of Orleans, in company with his brother the\ncount de Vertus, and, according to the treaty, attended by only fifty\nmen at arms, entered the church of our Lady at Chartres, with the king\ntheir uncle, the queen, the duke of Acquitaine, and several princes of\nthe blood.\n\nThat the king and lords might not be pressed upon by the spectators,\nand that all might plainly see the ceremony, a scaffolding was erected\nin the church, on which the king was seated near the crucifix. Round\nhim were placed the queen, the dauphin and dauphiness, daughter to the\nduke of Burgundy, the kings of Sicily and Navarre, the dukes of Berry\nand Bourbon; the cardinal de Bar, the marquis du Pont his brother, the\narchbishop of Sens, and the bishop of Chartres, with other counts,\nprelates, and the family of Orleans were behind the king. At the\nentrance of the church, by the king\u2019s orders, were a body of men at\narms drawn up in battle-array.\n\nIt was not long before the duke of Burgundy entered the church, and on\nhis advancing toward the king, all the lords, excepting the king, queen\nand dauphin, rose up from their seats. The duke, on his approach to the\nking, kneeled down with his advocate the lord d\u2019Ollehaing, who repeated\nto the king the following words:\n\n\u2018Sire, behold here my lord of Burgundy, your subject and cousin, who\nis thus come before you, because he has heard you are angry with him,\nfor the action he has committed against the person of the late duke of\nOrleans your brother, for the good of yourself and your kingdom,--the\ntruth of which he is ready to declare and prove to you, whenever you\nshall please. My lord, therefore, entreats of you, in the most humble\nmanner possible, that you would be pleased to withdraw from him your\nanger, and restore him to your good graces.\u2019 When the lord d\u2019Ollehaing\nhad said this, the duke of Burgundy himself addressed the king, saying,\n\u2018Sire, I entreat this of you:\u2019--when instantly the duke of Berry,\nseeing the king made no reply, bade the duke of Burgundy retire some\npaces behind,--which being done, the duke of Berry, kneeling before\nthe king, said something to him in a low voice,--and immediately the\ndauphin, the kings of Sicily and Navarre, with the duke of Berry, knelt\ndown to the king, and said, \u2018Sire, we supplicate that you would be\npleased to listen to the prayer of your cousin the duke of Burgundy.\u2019\nThe king answered them, \u2018We will that it be so,--and we grant it from\nour love to you.\u2019\n\nThe duke of Burgundy then approached the king, who said to him,--\u2018Fair\ncousin, we grant your request, and pardon you fully for what you have\ndone.\u2019 After this, he advanced, with the lord d\u2019Ollehaing, toward the\nchildren of Orleans, who, as I have said, were behind the king weeping\nmuch.\n\nThe lord d\u2019Ollehaing addressed them, saying, \u2018My lords, behold the\nduke of Burgundy, who entreats of you to withdraw from your hearts\nwhatever hatred or revenge you may harbour within them, for the act\nperpetrated against the person of my lord of Orleans, your father, and\nthat henceforward ye may remain good friends.\u2019 The duke of Burgundy\nthen added, \u2018And I beg this of you.\u2019 No answer being made, the king\ncommanded them to accede to the request of his fair cousin the duke\nof Burgundy. Upon which they replied, \u2018Sire, since you are pleased to\ncommand us, we grant him his request, and shall extinguish all the\nhatred we bore him; for we should be sorry to disobey you in any thing\nthat may give you pleasure.\u2019\n\nThe cardinal de Bar then, by the king\u2019s orders, brought an open Bible,\non which the two parties, namely, the two sons of the late duke of\nOrleans and the duke of Burgundy swore on the holy evangelists,\ntouching them with their hands, that they would mutually preserve a\nfirm peace towards each other, without any open or secret attempts\ncontrary to the full meaning of their oaths. When this was done, the\nking said, \u2018We will that henceforth ye be good friends; and I most\nstrictly enjoin, that neither of you attempt any thing to the loss or\nhurt of the other, nor against any persons who are attached to you,\nor who may have given you advice or assistance; and that you show\nno hatred against any one on this occasion, under pain of offending\nagainst our royal authority,--excepting, however, those who actually\ncommitted this murder, who shall be for ever banished from our kingdom.\u2019\n\nAfter this speech of the king, these princes again swore they would\nfaithfully abide by their treaty. The duke of Burgundy then advanced\nto salute the wife of the dauphin, the duke of Acquitaine; and about\nan hour after this ceremony had taken place the duke took his leave\nof the king, queen, and the lords present, and set out from Chartres\nfor Gallardon, where he dined. Many who were there were very much\nrejoiced that matters had gone off so well; but others were displeased,\nand murmured, saying, that henceforward it would be no great offence\nto murder a prince of the blood, since those who had done so were so\neasily acquitted, without making any reparation, or even begging pardon.\n\nThe duke of Orleans and his brother shortly after took leave of the\nking, queen, dauphin, and the lords of the court, and returned, with\ntheir attendants, to Blois, whence they had come, not well satisfied,\nany more than their council, with the peace that had been made.\n\nThe marquis du Pont, son to the duke of Bar, and cousin to the duke of\nBurgundy, who before this day was not beloved by him, on account of\nthe murder of the duke of Orleans, followed him to Gallardon, where\nthey dined publicly together in great friendship and concord. About two\no\u2019clock in the afternoon duke William, the count de St Pol, and other\ngreat lords, visited the duke of Burgundy at his lodgings in Gallardon,\nand then returned together toward Paris.\n\nThe king, the queen, the dauphin, and the other kings, princes and\ncardinals, arrived at Paris on Mid-Lent Sunday; and the dukes of\nBurgundy and of Holland, with the cardinal de Bordeaux, who was at that\ntime in Paris, on his way to the council of Pisa, went out to meet\nthem, followed by upwards of two hundred thousand Parisians of both\nsexes, eager to receive the king, singing carols, as he entered the\ngates, and conducting him with great rejoicings to his palace.\n\nThey were very happy that the king was returned to Paris, and also that\na peace had been concluded respecting the death of the late duke of\nOrleans. They attributed the whole to the great mercy of God, who had\npermitted that such strong symptoms of a civil war should be so readily\nextinguished; but they did not foresee or consider the consequences\nthat ensued.\n\nThe greater part of the Parisians were obstinately attached to the\nduke of Burgundy, through the hope that by his means all the most\noppressive taxes would be abolished; but they did not see clearly all\nthe mischiefs that afterward befel the kingdom and themselves,--for in\na very short time, as you shall hear, a most cruel contention broke out\nbetween the families of Orleans and Burgundy.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. VI.\n\n    THE QUEEN OF SPAIN DIES DURING THE SITTING OF THE COUNCIL AT\n    PISA.--THE MARRIAGE OF THE KING OF DENMARK, NORWAY AND SWEDEN.\n\n\nIn this year died the queen of Spain[19], sister to Henry king of\nEngland, and mother to the young king of Spain and queen of Portugal.\nThe Spaniards after her death sent home all the english servants, male\nand female, belonging to the late queen, who returned to England in\nmuch grief and sorrow at heart.\n\nAt this same season, great numbers of prelates, archbishops, bishops\nand abbots, set out from various countries of Christendom to attend the\ncouncil at Pisa which was assembling to restore union to the church,\nwhich had for a long time suffered a schism, to the great displeasure\nof many princes and well-inclined persons.\n\nAbout this same period, Henry[20] king of Denmark, Norway and Sweden,\ntook to wife the daughter of Henry king of England. These kingdoms were\nput into the hands of the king of Denmark by their queen, who divested\nherself of all power and profit over them in favour of king Henry.\n\n\n\n\n[A. D. 1409.]\n\nCHAP. VII.\n\n    THE KING OF FRANCE HAS A SEVERE RETURN OF HIS DISORDER.--THE\n    MARRIAGE OF THE COUNT DE NEVERS WITH THE DAMSEL OF COUCY.--THE\n    WAR OF AM\u00c9 DE VIRY, A SAVOYARD, WITH THE DUKE OF BOURBON.\n\n\nAt the beginning of this year, Charles king of France was much\noppressed with his usual disorder. On this account, when the kings of\nNavarre and Sicily, and the duke of Berry, had properly provided, in\nconjunction with the duke of Burgundy, for the state of the king, and\nthe government of the realm, they went to visit their own territories.\nIn like manner, the duke of Burgundy, went to the marriage of his\nbrother Philip count of Nevers, who took to wife the damsel of Coucy,\ndaughter to sir Enguerrand de Coucy[21], formerly lord and count of\nSoissons, and niece by the mother\u2019s side to the duke of Lorraine and to\nthe count de Vaudemont; which marriage was celebrated in the town of\nSoissons.\n\nThis ceremony was performed on Saint George\u2019s day, and the feasts and\nentertainments lasted for three days afterward. There were present the\nduchess of Lorraine[22] and the countess of Vaudemont[23], who had come\nexpressly thither to do honour to the lady of Coucy and her daughter.\n\nWhen these feasts were over, the duke of Burgundy, attended by his\nson-in-law the count de Penthievre, set out for Burgundy; and shortly\nafter, the count de Nevers conducted his wife, and the duchess of\nLorraine and the countess of Vaudemont, to his county of Rethel, where\nshe was received with every token of joy.\n\nDuring this time, the duke of Bourbon was challenged by Am\u00e9 de Viry,\na Savoyard, and a poor blade in comparison with the duke of Bourbon;\nnevertheless, he committed much damage by fire and sword in the\ncountries of Bresse and Beaujolois. The duke was very indignant at\nthis, and assembled a large body of men at arms and archers to punish\nand conquer him. He ordered his son, the count de Clermont, to lead on\nthe van, and he speedily followed in person.\n\nIn his company were the counts de la Marche and de Vend\u00f4me, the lord\nd\u2019Albret, constable of France, Louis de Baviere, brother to the queen,\nMontagu, grand master of the king\u2019s household, the lord de la Heuse and\nmany more great lords, who advanced with a numerous body of men to the\ncounty of Beaujolois.\n\nAm\u00e9 de Viry was informed of the great force which the duke of Bourbon\nwas marching against him, and dared not wait his arrival; for he had\nnot strength enough to garrison the forts he had taken. On his retreat,\nhe marched to a town called Bourg-en-Bresse, which belonged to the earl\nof Savoy, his lord. The earl, however, would not support him against\nhis great uncle, the duke of Bourbon, but gave him up, on condition\nthat Am\u00e9 should make every amends in his power for the mischiefs he had\ndone, and should surrender himself to one of the prisons of the duke,\nuntil he should have completely made him satisfaction, but that no harm\nof any sort should be done to his person.\n\nThe duke of Bourbon gladly received him, and thanked his nephew for his\nfriendship.--This caused a quarrel of some standing to be made up; for\nthe earl of Savoy had declared his great uncle owed him homage for his\nlands of Beaujolois, which he would not pay,--but now the dispute was\nmutually referred by them to the duke of Berry.\n\nWhen these matters were concluded, the duke of Bourbon returned to\nFrance, and disbanded his forces. Some time after, by means which Viry\nmade use of with the duke, he obtained his liberty. Waleran count de\nSt Pol intended being of this expedition with the duke of Bourbon, and\nraised a large force; but on marching near Paris, he was ordered not to\nproceed further, and to return to the frontiers of the Boulonois, where\nhe had been specially commissioned by the king.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. VIII.\n\n    TWO COMBATS TAKE PLACE AT PARIS IN THE PRESENCE OF THE\n    KING.----THE DEATH OF THE ARCHBISHOP OF RHEIMS.----THE COUNCIL\n    AT PISA.\n\n\nAbout Ascension-day, the king of France, who had been grievously ill,\nwas restored to health,--and in consequence, the dukes of Berry,\nBurgundy, and Bourbon, with many other lords, instantly returned to\nParis. Two combats were ordained to be fought in the square behind St\nMartin des Champs, in the presence of the king and the aforesaid lords.\nOne was between a breton knight, called sir William Batailler, and an\nEnglishman, named sir John Carmien, for a breach of faith.\n\nWhen they were met, and Montjoye king at arms had proclaimed their\nchallenges and the causes of them, in the accustomed manner, he bade\nthem do their duty. Sir William, who was the appellant, issued first\nout of his pavilion, and marched proudly toward his adversary, who was\nadvancing to meet him. They threw their lances without effect, and\nthen made use of their swords: but in this last combat the Englishman\nwas slightly wounded below his armour, when the king instantly put an\nend to the fight. They were both very honourably led out of the lists,\nand conducted to their lodgings.\n\nThe other combat was between the seneschal of Hainault and sir John\nCornwall, an english knight of great renown, and who had married a\nsister to the king of England[24]. This combat was undertaken by the\ntwo knights at the desire of the duke of Burgundy, when at Lille, to\nshow their prowess in running a few courses with the lance and giving\nsome strokes with the battle-axe: but when the duke had caused the\nlists to be prepared, the two champions were ordered by the king to\nrepair to Paris, and to perform their deeds of arms in his presence.\n\nAccording to these orders, and on the appointed day, sir John Cornwall\nentered the lists first, very grandly equipped, and, galloping his\nhorse around, came before the king, whom he gallantly saluted. He was\nfollowed by six little pages mounted on as many war-horses, the two\nfirst of which were covered with furniture of ermines, and the other\nfour with cloth of gold. When he had made his obeisances, the pages\nretired without the lists.\n\nShortly after, the seneschal arrived, attended by the duke of Brabant\nand his brother, the count de Nevers, each holding a rein of his horse,\non his right and left. The count de Clermont bore his battle-axe, and\nthe count de Penthievre his lance. When he had made the circuit of the\nlists, and had saluted the king, as sir John Cornwall had done, they\nprepared to tilt with their lances; but as they were on the point of so\ndoing, the king caused it to be proclaimed that they should not proceed\nin this matter, which was very displeasing to both of them, and forced\nthem to return to their h\u00f4tels.\n\nIt was again proclaimed, by the king\u2019s orders, that this deed of arms\nshould not be carried further,--and that in future no one, under pain\nof capital punishment, should, throughout his realm, challenge another\nto a duel without a substantial cause.\n\nWhen the king had magnificently feasted these two knights, and shown\nthem much honour at his court, they departed, as it was said, for\nEngland, with the intention of completing their deed of arms.\n\nDuring this time, the cardinal de Bar, son to the duke of Bar, and\nGuye de Roye, archbishop of Rheims, in company with master Peter\nd\u2019Ailly, bishop of Cambray, and several other prelates and churchmen,\nwere journeying to the general council which was to be held at Pisa,\nand took up their lodgings one night at a town called Voltri, on the\nsea-coast, about four leagues from Genoa. At this place the blacksmith\nof the archbishop had a quarrel with a blacksmith of the town, about\nthe price of shoeing a horse, which proceeded from words to blows, and\nthe archbishop\u2019s blacksmith killed the other, and fled instantly for\nsafety to the lodgings of his master.\n\nThe townsmen immediately rose,--and a great number of them came to\nrevenge the death of their countryman. The archbishop, hearing of the\ncause of this tumult, left his chamber, and kindly addressed them,\npromising to have the injury immediately repaired, according to their\nwishes; and, the more to appease them, he delivered up his blacksmith\ninto the hands of the magistrate of the place, who was a lieutenant of\nBoucicaut marshal of France, then governor of Genoa.\n\nBut this was of no avail,--for as the archbishop was speaking to them,\nwithout the door of his house, one of the mob thrust his javelin right\nthrough his body to the heart, so that he dropped down dead without\nuttering another word. It was a great pity, for he was a religious\nprelate, and of a noble family.\n\nThis deed, however, did not satisfy them; for instantly after they\nmurdered the magistrate and the aforesaid blacksmith, and also\nendeavoured to force their way into the house, whither the cardinal de\nBar and the greater part of the others had retired, in order to put\nthem likewise to death.\n\nThey were, however, at length appeased by the principal inhabitants,\nand it was concluded that the cardinal should grant them his pardon for\nwhat they had done against him,--to which, indeed, he was induced by\nhis attendants, from their fears of being all destroyed.\n\nThey never told him of the murder of the archbishop until he was gone\ntwo leagues from the town: on the hearing of it, he was so troubled,\nand sick at heart, that he was near falling off his mule. His\nattendants, notwithstanding, made him hasten his pace as much as they\ncould; for they were alarmed for their lives, after the instances they\nhad seen, and from the numbers of people they perceived descending\nthe hills, and the accustomed signs they saw when a town is under any\napprehension of danger, and the ringing of bells in the manner usual on\nthese occasions.\n\nThese signals were sounded throughout the country, and the peasants\nwere seen running down the hills to overtake them; but when they were\narrived within a league of Genoa, the marshal Boucicaut[25] came out\nwith a handsome company to meet him. The cardinal made loud complaints\nto him of the outrages that had been committed on his people at the\ntown of Voltri, and demanded that he would judicially inquire into it.\nThe marshal replied, that he would make so severe an example of that\ntown that all others should take warning from it.\n\nThe cardinal was then conducted into the city of Genoa, where he was\nmade welcome by the churchmen and other inhabitants; and this same\nday the body of the archbishop of Rheims was brought thither, and\nhonourably interred,--and his obsequies were performed in the principal\nchurch of Genoa.\n\nShortly after, the marshal Boucicaut punished most severely all whom\nhe could apprehend that had committed these outrages, with their\naccomplices: they were put to death in various ways, and their houses\nalso were razed to the ground, that these executions might serve for\nwarnings to others never to commit such cruel murders.\n\nThe cardinal de Bar, with his companions, now set out from Genoa, and\ntravelled, by easy day\u2019s journies, to Pisa, where were assembled a\nprodigious number of cardinals, doctors in theology, and graduates in\ncivil law and other sciences, ambassadors and prelates, in obedience\nto the two popes, from different kingdoms, and from all parts of\nChristendom.\n\nAfter many councils had been held on the schism in the church, they\ncame at last to this conclusion: they unanimously condemned the\ntwo rival popes as heretics, schismatics, obstinate in evil, and\nperturbators of the peace of our holy mother the church. This sentence\nwas passed in the presence of twenty-four cardinals, at the gates\nof Pisa, before all the people, the 15th day of June, in the year\naforesaid.\n\nThe same cardinals, after invoking the grace and assistance of the\nholy Spirit, entered into conclave, where they remained until the 16th\nday of the same month, when they finished their election. They chose\nPeter of Candia, so named from being a native of that island: he was\nof the order of Friars Minors, created a doctor in theology at Paris,\narchbishop of Milan and cardinal; and, when consecrated sovereign of\nthe true and holy catholic church, he took the name of Pope Alexander V.\n\nO, most powerful God! how great was the joy thus caused, through thy\nnever-failing grace; for it is impossible to relate the shoutings and\nacclamations that resounded for more than a league round the city of\nPisa. But what shall we say of the city of Paris? Why, when this joyful\nnews was brought thither, on the 8th of July, they incessantly shouted,\nnight and day, \u2018Long live Alexander V. our pope!\u2019 in all the squares\nand streets, and entertained all passengers with meat and drink, from\ntheir heartfelt happiness. When the ceremony of consecrating the pope\nwas over, letters were sent to different persons, the more fully to\nexplain the proceedings of the council. I shall insert the one written\nby the abbot of Saint Maixence to the bishop of Poitiers, the tenor of\nwhich was as follows.\n\n\u2018Reverend father, and my redoubted lord, after my humble respects being\naccepted, I know that your reverence would gladly be informed of the\nproceedings of the council, which has been held in the city of Pisa,\nand any intelligence concerning it; and it is for this reason I have\nindited the following lines to your reverence.\n\n\u2018First, then, on the 25th day of March all the cardinals, who had been\ncreated by both popes, and all the prelates then in Pisa, assembled\nin the church of St Martin, which is situated beyond the river, on the\nroad leading to Florence, and thence being dressed in their robes, with\nmitres on their heads, they made a grand procession to the cathedral\nchurch, which is as distant from that of Saint Martin as our church of\nN\u00f4tre Dame at Paris is from that of St Martin des Champs. There the\ncouncil always afterward assembled; and on this first day, mass was\ncelebrated with great solemnity: the sermon was preached by my lord\ncardinal of Milan, of the order of Friars Minors, a great theologian.\nWhen the service was over, the morrow was fixed on to open the council,\nand the two popes were summoned to attend on that day at the gates of\nthe church by two cardinals; but neither of them appeared, nor any one\nfor them.\n\n\u2018The council continued to sit till the latter end of March, when the\npopes were again summoned to appear, but neither of them obeyed. The\ncouncil therefore having required the two rival popes to come before\nthem, on account of the schism that has reigned in the church, and\nneither of them appearing, or sending any one to make satisfactory\nanswers for them, and the term allotted for their appearing being\nelapsed, declared them both guilty of the schism that distresses the\nchurch, and of contumacy, by their conduct, toward the council.\n\n\u2018The council ordered prosecutions to be carried on against both of the\npopes, on the Monday after Quasimodo-Sunday, the 15th of April, when\nmy lords cardinals celebrated together the service of the holy week.\nOn Good Friday, my lord cardinal d\u2019Orsini celebrated divine service in\nSaint Martin\u2019s church; and a secular doctor of divinity, from Bologna\nla Grassa, preached an excellent sermon.\n\n\u2018My lords cardinals were all present at the ceremonies of Easter\nSunday. During the ensuing week they assembled in council, sometimes\nalone, at others they called in the prelates, to deliberate on the\nstate of affairs, and what line of conduct should be pursued; and every\nthing was carried on with mutual good will on all sides. This week the\nambassadors from the king of the Romans arrived at Pisa.\n\n\u2018On the Sunday of Quasimodo, an italian bishop said mass before the\ncardinals; and a cordelier from Languedoc, a doctor in divinity\npreached the sermon, in which he greatly praised my lords cardinals\nfrom France, and such as were seeking to restore peace to the\nchurch,--but very harshly treated the two contending popes, calling\nthem schismatics, heretics, and traitorous enemies to God and to his\nchurch. He chose for his text, \u2018Jesus dixit, Pax vobis,\u2019 which he\nhandled extraordinarily well.\n\n\u2018The following Monday, the cardinals, prelates, ambassadors, and\nprocurators then present, made oath to obey the decisions of the\ncouncil. Mass was then chaunted, and succeeded by many prayers; then\nthe litany was sung, at which all the cardinals and prelates, dressed\nin their robes and mitres, attended, and so continued as long as the\nsittings of the council lasted, which made it a handsome sight to see.\n\n\u2018This same day, the council gave audience to the ambassadors from\nRobert king of the Romans; and the bishop of Verdun, on the part of\nRobert, who favoured pope Gregory as much as he could, began his\nharangue, taking for his theme, \u2018Pax vobis.\u2019 He made many mischievous\npropositions, to divide and distract the council, in obedience to\nhis master, and to serve the false pope Gregory. There were with\nthis bishop an archbishop of a foreign order, and a numerous body of\nattendants. When the bishop had made his propositions, the ambassadors\nwere required to deliver the same in writing, and to show their\nprocurations from their lord. A day was then fixed to hear the answer\nof the council to their propositions; but before this day arrived, the\nambassadors went away without taking leave of their host.\n\n\u2018This week of Quasimodo, the lord Malatesta came to Pisa in great\nstate: he had given to pope Gregory one of his castles called\nRimini[26], and made the following request to the cardinals assembled,\nas well on the part of pope Gregory as on his own,--namely, that it\nwould please the members of the council to adjourn its sittings, and\nchange the place of its meeting; that if they would so do, pope Gregory\nwould attend personally, provided the situation were in a place of\nsafety, and that he might have security for his coming to and going\nfrom it.\n\n\u2018In consequence of this request, the cardinals summoned the prelates to\nnotify it to them; but they unanimously declared, they would neither\nconsent that the place of holding the council should be changed nor\nthat the meetings of it should be adjourned. This answer was very\nagreeable to the cardinals. The lord Malatesta, therefore, returned\nwithout having succeeded in his object; but his anger was appeased by\nsome of the cardinals, his friends and acquaintance.\n\n\u2018From the 15th of April, the council continued sitting to the 23d\nof the said month,--when, after the solemnity of the mass, the\nadvocate-fiscal demanded, that the council should declare, that the\nconjunction of the two colleges of cardinals of the holy church of Rome\nhad been, and was, lawful and canonical at the time it was formed.\n\n\u2018Item, that it should declare, that this holy council is duly\ncanonical, by the cardinals of both colleges assembling for so\nexcellent a purpose.\n\n\u2018Item, that this holy council has been called together by the cardinals\nof both colleges with a good intent.\n\n\u2018Item, that it has been assembled at a convenient opportunity.\n\n\u2018Item, that it should declare, that this holy council, as representing\nthe universal church of God, has a right to take cognizance of the\nmerits of the two competitors for the papacy.\n\n\u2018Item, that a narrative should this day be read of the introduction and\ncommencement of the schism that took place from the time of the death\nof pope Gregory X. until the convention of this holy general council.\n\n\u2018In this narrative were displayed all the tricks and deceits that had\nbeen made use of, either individually or conjunctively by the two rival\npopes.\n\n\u2018After it had been read, the advocate fiscal drew several conclusions\nagainst the said rivals and their pretensions to the papacy, and ended\nhis harangue by demanding that they should be deposed and punished\ncorporally, and that the council should proceed to the election of a\ntrue and holy pope.\n\n\u2018The sittings were prolonged to Saturday the 27th day of the same\nmonth, when the ambassadors from the king of England entered the\ncouncil with a most magnificent state.--The bishop of Salisbury[27],\nin the diocese of Canterbury, made a handsome speech, urging the\nnecessity of peace and union in the church.\n\n\u2018When he had finished, the advocate-fiscal made an interesting oration,\nand concluded by demanding, through the procurator of the holy council,\nthat it would please to appoint a commission of certain wise, discreet,\nand experienced persons to examine witnesses as to the notorious sins\ncharged on the two competitors for the papacy, and his request was\ngranted.\n\n\u2018The second Sunday after Easter, mass was celebrated before the\ncardinals, and the sermon was preached by the bishop of Digne in\nProvence: he was of the order of Friars Minors, a learned doctor in\ndivinity, and had ever been a great friend to Pietro della Luna, and\nwas well acquainted with the tricks and cavils of both popes. This\nbishop delivered a good sermon from his text of \u2018Mercenarius fugit,\u2019 in\nwhich he discovered many deceptions of the two rivals, in descanting on\nthe words of his text.\n\n\u2018The sittings were continued from this Sunday to the 2d day of May,\nwhen mass was said before the cardinals; and the sermon was preached\nby the cardinal Prenestin, more commonly called the cardinal of\nPoitiers.--He delivered a good discourse, and chose for his text,\n\u2018Libera Deus Israel ex omnibus tribulationibus suis.\u2019 He urged in his\nsermon eleven conclusive arguments against the two popes, for refusing\nto give peace to the church, and ended by requiring the council, in\nconsideration of their obstinate contumacy, to proceed against them and\nprovide a pastor for the flock of God.\n\n\u2018On the 2d day of May, there was a general meeting of the council,\nwhen, after the usual solemnities, a very renowned doctor of Bologna\nmade a reply to the insidious propositions of the bishop of Verdun, on\nthe part of the emperor Robert. He condemned, by arguments drawn from\ndivine, canon, and civil law, all that had been advanced by the bishop;\nand his reasoning was so just and clear that the council were much\nsatisfied and comforted.\n\n\u2018The ensuing Sunday, mass was said before the cardinals, and the sermon\nwas preached by the general of the order of Augustins. He was a great\ndoctor in divinity, and a native of Italy. He chose for his text, \u2018Cum\nvenerit ille arguet mundum de peccato, et de justitia, et de judicio.\u2019\nHe discussed this subject very well, and with a good intent.\n\n\u2018The sittings were prolonged from this 2d of May to the 10th.--The\npatriarch of Alexandria celebrated mass before the cardinals on the\nfeast of the revelation of St Michael, the 8th of May; and he likewise\npreached a sermon, taking for his text, \u2018Congregata est ecclesia ex\nfiliis Israel et omnes qui fugiebant a malis additi sunt, et facti\nsunt illis ad firmamentum.\u2019 These words are written in the 2nd and 5th\nchapters of the first book of Machabees. In the course of this sermon,\nhe pressed six arguments against the two rival popes.\n\n\u2018On Friday, the 10th of May, the council, after the usual solemnities,\nresumed its sittings, when the advocate-fiscal made the following\nrequisitions: that the holy council would be pleased to confirm and\napprove the demands he had before made, namely, that it should declare\nthat the union of the two colleges of cardinals has been and is legal;\nand that the council should pronounce definitively on the other demands\nhe had made. The procurator fiscal made a request to the council, that\neight days should be allowed for the production of witnesses; and the\ncouncil was adjourned to the 16th of May.\n\n\u2018On the Sunday preceding that day, mass was said before the cardinals\nby the bishop of Faenza; and the sermon preached by a native of\nArragon, a learned doctor in divinity, who had always been of the party\nof Pietro della Luna. He chose his text from one of St Paul\u2019s epistles,\n\u2018Expurgate vetus fermentum ut sitis nova conspersio.\u2019 He expatiated on\nthis with such ability that all the doctors wondered. Drawing from it\ncertain conclusions, he said that the two rivals were as much popes\nas his old shoes, calling them worse than Annas and Caiaphas, and\ncomparing them to the devils in hell.\n\n\u2018Such things passed in the council to the 23d day of this present\nmonth, as I have briefly related, on which day the ambassadors from the\nking of Spain were to come to Pisa. The number of prelates that were\npresent cannot be estimated, for they were daily increased by new ones,\nwho came from all parts of Christendom. I should suppose that at the\nlast sitting of the council there were present of cardinals, bishops,\narchbishops, and abbots, wearing mitres, one hundred and forty, without\ncounting the non-mitred members.\n\n\u2018There were also ambassadors from the kings of France, England,\nJerusalem, Sicily, Cyprus, and Poland; from the dukes of Brabant,\nAustria, Stephen of Bavaria, William of Bavaria; from the counts of\nCleves and of Brandac[28]; from the marquis of Brandenbourg and de\nMoraine[29]; from the archbishops of Cologne, Mentz and Saltzbourg, and\nfrom the bishop of Maestricht; from the grand master of the Teutonic\norder; from the patriarch of Aquileia, and from many princes in Italy.\nNumbers of doctors in divinity, and in the canon and civil law, were\npresent, as well from France as from other countries, and very many\nprocurators from divers parts of the world, who, by the grace of God,\nhave held instructive and charitable conversations together from the\ncommencement of the council until this moment.\n\n\u2018In the city of Pisa are abundance of all sorts of provisions, which\nare sold at reasonable prices; but they would be much cheaper, were\nit not for the gabelles and taxes that are levied in these countries.\nIn my mind, Pisa is one of the handsomest cities existing: it has a\nnavigable river, within a league distant, running into the sea,--and\nwhich river brings large vessels, laden with different merchandise, to\nthe town. Around the city are vineyards of white grapes and many fine\nmeadows.\n\n\u2018We are very well lodged, considering the great number of men at\narms quartered in it for its guard. The town has been conquered by\nthe Florentines, who have banished many of the Pisans to prevent any\ntreasons, and sent them to Florence, to the amount of two thousand; and\nthey are obliged to show themselves twice every day to the governor at\nan appointed place, under pain of death.\n\n\u2018Four or five thousand of the Pisans went to ask succour from king\nLancelot[30], who, in compliance with their request, advanced within\nfive leagues of Pisa, with a force of twenty-three thousand combatants,\nas well horse as foot; but the Florentines, through the grace of God,\nare well able to resist all his power, and guard us. True it is, that\nthis king Lancelot ran a risk of losing his kingdom by the union of\nthe holy church, for he had tyrannically seized on a large part of the\npatrimony of St Peter.\n\n\u2018It was said that there were certain ambassadors from Pietro della Luna\nat the council, not with the intent of forwarding the union, but of\nthrowing every obstacle in its way.\n\n\u2018There were nineteen cardinals of both colleges, at this council\nat Pisa, including the cardinal de Challan, whose attendants were\narrived,--and the cardinal was to follow with the ambassadors from\nSavoy.\n\n\u2018My lords the cardinals are much displeased with those bishops,\nabbots, and chapters of cathedral churches, who have neglected to send\nprocurators to this general council. I have nothing more to send to\nyou at present.--Written at Pisa the 15th day of May, by your humble\nmonk and servant, the abbot of St Maxence.\u2019\n\nThe direction was, \u2018To the reverend father in JESUS CHRIST, and by the\ngrace of God, lord bishop of Poitiers, and chancellor to my lord the\nduke of Berry.\u2019\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. IX.\n\n    THE AMBASSADORS TO THE COUNCIL FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF PARIS\n    WRITE LETTERS, TO INFORM THOSE WHO HAD SENT THEM OF WHAT\n    HAD PASSED AT THIS COUNCIL.--PIETRO DELLA LUNA AND GREGORY\n    ARE DEPRIVED OF THE PAPACY, AND ALL PERSONS FORBIDDEN BY\n    THE HOLY COUNCIL FROM OBEYING EITHER IN ANY MANNER.--PETER\n    OF CANDIA, A CORDELIER, IS ELECTED BISHOP OF ROME BY THE\n    CARDINALS.--REGULATIONS FOR THE APPROBATION OF THE GENERAL\n    COUNCIL.\n\n\nI shall now transcribe the letters written by the ambassadors from the\nuniversity of Paris to the council at Pisa, the contents of which are\nas follows.\n\n\u2018Reverend fathers, lords and masters, after offering you our humble\nrecommendation, may it please you to know, that we write to inform you\nof the conclusions entered into by the council-general, which has held\nthirteen sittings.\n\n\u2018The two rival popes, having for some time been waited for in vain,\nnotwithstanding the summons sent them, have been declared contumacious\nin respect to schism and the faith. Many decrees were passed against\nthem for their contumacy, and commissioners were appointed to examine\nwitnesses against them.\n\n\u2018Item, the council-general approved of the union of the colleges of\ncardinals, the citations served on the contending popes, and the place\nof meeting of the council, as being perfectly convenient and secure.\nThe council declared, that it was supreme on earth to take cognizance\nand judge of the charges brought against the contenders for the papacy.\nIt was also declared by the council, that it had been lawful for any\none to quit his obedience to either of the popes, from the moment they\nhad promised to abdicate the papacy; and that all suits and processes,\ncarried on against such as had quitted their obedience to either, were\nannulled and of no weight.\n\n\u2018Public charges were then made against them, and an interlocutory\nsentence passed on the notorious sins of the two competitors. This\nday, doctor Peter Paoul declared, in full council, your opinions,\nand took for his text, \u2018Congregabuntur filii Jud\u00e6 et filii Israel et\nfacient sibimet caput unum.\u2019 That is to say, Those who are come to\nthis council, and such as shall hereafter come, will choose from among\nthemselves a head to the church. A little before this, doctor Dominic\nle Petit had made a solemn harangue before all the cardinals, taking\nfor his text, \u2018Principes populorum congregati sunt cum Deo Abraham.\u2019\nThe cardinals and prelates of the holy church are styled princes of\nthe people. On this day also, the theologians, to the number of six\nscore and three, delivered their opinions, and eighty of them are your\nfriends and supporters.\n\n\u2018Item, this day it has been ordered that the two rival popes be\nsummoned to appear at the doors of the church on Wednesday the 5th of\nJuly, to hear their definitive sentence.\n\n\u2018Gregory has sent a bull to the English to entreat they would be of his\nparty, with Robert king of the Romans, to change the place of holding\nthe council, and that they would please to be of his council; but\nhe labours in vain, for the English, Germans, Bohemians, Polanders,\nFrench, those from Cyprus, Rhodes and Italy, are all unanimous,\nexcepting Robert, whose ambassadors have gone away.\n\n\u2018Few prelates have come to this council from the kingdom of Hungary.\nKing Ladislaus wrote that he intended being here in person, but he is\nfully occupied in his war against the infidels.\n\n\u2018Pietro Mastin, called della Luna, has issued a most thundering bull,\nin which he admonishes the cardinals to return to their duty toward\nhim; and should they refuse, he prohibits them from attempting to\nmake another election, menacing them, in case of disobedience, with\nexcommunication and other penalties against them and their supporters.\n\n\u2018Reverend fathers, and redoubted masters, we have nothing more for the\npresent to write to you, except that all nations seem inclined to a\nreformation in the church, which the new pope, whom it shall please\nGod to elect, will be forced to comply with. Should you have any orders\nto send us, we are ready to obey them to the utmost of our power.\nBeseeching you humbly to keep all our concerns in your consideration,\nmay the Sovereign Lord have you under his guard!\n\n\u2018Written at Pisa the 29th day of May.\u2019 Underneath were signed the\nnames of Dominic le Petit, Pierre Paoul de Quesnoy, Jean Pere Ponce,\nVincent, Eustace de Faquemberge, Arnoul Vibrant, Jean Bourlet, dit\nFran\u00e7ois.--Master Pierre de Poingny and master Guillaume le Charpentier\ndid not sign the above, because they were absent.\n\nHere follows the sentence on the two contending popes.\n\n\u2018This present holy council, assembled in the name of JESUS CHRIST,\nwithdraws itself from the obedience to Pietro della Luna, called Pope\nBenedict XIII. and from Angelo Corrario, called Pope Gregory XII.; and\nthe holy council decrees and declares, that all true Catholics ought to\ndo the same.\n\n\u2018Item, the same holy synod, as representative and judge of the\nuniversal church, after mature consideration and examination of\nwitnesses concerning the horrible sins of the two contending popes,\npronounces, in the church of Pisa, this its definitive sentence, that\nboth popes be deprived of every honour and dignity, especially that of\nthe papacy. It also pronounces, that they be separated from the holy\nchurch, in conformity to the sacred canons, and by the above sentence,\nforbidding all persons to have the boldness ever to defend or obey\neither of them as pope.\n\n\u2018The council forbids any Christians from obeying or showing favour\nto either, notwithstanding any oath or promise they may have made or\nentered into, under pain of excommunication,--and decrees, that whoever\nshall disobey this sentence shall be delivered into the hands of\nsecular justice, and condemned as one who favours heretics, and that he\nshall be punished according to the divine commandments, and the decrees\nof the holy canons.\n\n\u2018The council also declares and pronounces, that all promotions of\ncardinals made by the two rival popes, namely, those made by Angelo\nCorrario since the 3d day of May, and by Pietra della Luna since the\n15th day of June, of the year 1408, have been and are of no effect,\nand are annulled by this definitive sentence. It also declares, that\nevery judgment given by the aforesaid competitors for the papacy, to\nthe prejudice of the holy church, against any kings, princes, lords,\npatriarchs, archbishops, bishops, prelates of the church, or other\nprivate persons, are of no effect; and the holy synod has ordained that\nproceedings to the contrary, and to the welfare of the holy church\nshall commence on the ensuing Monday, the 10th day of June.\u2019\n\nThe above sentences and declarations were passed in the general council\nof Pisa, the 5th day of June, in the year 1409.\n\nThe 26th day of June, in the year 1409, Peter of Candia, a Cordelier\nand native of Greece, doctor of divinity, and usually called the\nCardinal of Milan, was unanimously chosen pope by the cardinals at\nPisa, with the approbation of the general council, and called Alexander\nV. who, immediately after his election, published the following bull.\n\n\u2018Alexander, bishop and servant to the servants of God, to the bishop\nof Paris, health and apostolical benediction. Praise and glory be to\nthe God of heaven for having instilled into the minds of men a desire\nof peace on earth, and who, through his benign grace and mercy, has\nbrought about an union of his Christian people, hitherto long disturbed\nby a dangerous schism.\n\n\u2018Who is there among mankind that will not most heartily rejoice at\nthis happy event, on considering the perils souls must run when such\ndivisions take place in the holy church, and which have for so long a\ntime been encouraged by sacrilegious schismatics?\n\n\u2018Our blessed God, taking pity on his people, who had long suffered\nfrom this division, opened and illuminated the minds of the holy\ngeneral council, who have justly condemned the two popes, according\nto the sacred canons, as enemies to God and his holy church, by their\nenormous, horrible, and notorious sins.\n\n\u2018When our brethren, the venerable Cardinals of the holy roman church,\nof whom we were one, were desirous of finding a proper pastor for the\nChristian flock, after the usual ceremonies and solemnities, with the\nconsent of the council-general, they entered into conclave, where,\nafter long discussions, they unanimously selected our humble self, then\ncardinal-priest of the church of the Twelve Apostles, and chose us\nbishop of Rome. Although we knew our unworthiness of so great a charge,\nconsidering our weakness, yet, always confiding in the aid of God, we\nhave accepted of it.\n\n\u2018Venerable brother, these things we notify to thee, as one loving and\ndesirous of the peace of the church, as we have been well informed;\nand we exhort thee and thy flock to render thanks to the all-powerful\nGod for this most gracious gift which he has granted to us. We have so\ngreat an affection for thy worthy person, that we inform thee, that we\nare ready to serve thee and thine to the utmost of our power.--This\npresent letter we have intrusted to be delivered to thee by our\nwell-beloved son, that notable man Paulin d\u2019Arc\u00e9, esquire of honour,\nchamberlain, and our loyal servant.--Given at Pisa the 8th day of July,\nin the first year of our papacy.\u2019\n\nIt is the good pleasure of our very sacred lord Alexander V. by divine\nProvidence, pope, that all promotions, translations, confirmations and\ncollations whatever, and all consecrations of bishops and others, that\nhave been granted or performed by the two competitors for the papacy,\nshall be considered as strictly legal, provided they were effected\nprior to passing of the definitive sentence, and done according to the\nregulations of the canon law.\n\nItem, it is also the pleasure of the general council, that our\naforesaid lord shall give his orders concerning the archbishop of Genoa.\n\nItem, the benefices in the church, that had been given by ordinary\njudges, have the approbation of the holy council to continue to them to\nwhom they have been given.\n\nItem, the holy council approves of proceedings being instituted against\nall who shall obstinately obey or favour either of the late competitors\nfor the papacy, Pietro della Luna or Angelo Corrario,--and the council\ncondemns such, as guilty of schism and notorious heresy, and ordains\nthat they be punished according to the regulations of the sacred canons.\n\nItem, it is ordered, that should the cardinal de Flisque[31] be willing\nto return to his duty, and appear personally within two months, he\nshall be kindly received, and enjoy all his honours and benefices,\nwhich he obtained in the year 1408.\n\nItem, all dispensations given by bishops of dioceses in those parts\nnot obedient to the two competitors, in the cases of persons not being\nof sufficient age to obtain dignities in the church or benefices,--and\nall absolutions, and acts of penitence, ordained by the competitors\nduring the schism, shall be reserved to the determination of the holy\napostolic see. All of which has been approved of and certified by the\nholy council.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. X.\n\n    THE DEATH OF THE BISHOP OF PARIS.----THE MARRIAGES, OF THE\n    DUKE OF BRABANT WITH THE NIECE OF THE KING OF BOHEMIA,--OF THE\n    CONSTABLE OF FRANCE\u2019S DAUGHTER WITH THE SON OF MONTAGU, GRAND\n    MASTER OF THE HOUSEHOLD,--OF THE KING OF CYPRUS WITH CHARLOTTE\n    DE BOURBON.\n\n\nIn these days, the lord John d\u2019Orgemont, bishop of Paris, departed this\nlife, in his episcopal palace, about the end of June. He was succeeded\nin his bishoprick by the lord Gerard de Montagu, bishop of Poitiers,\nchancellor to the duke of Berry, and brother to the grand master of\nthe king\u2019s household and to the archbishop of Sens. He was honourably\nreceived in the cathedral church of N\u00f4tre Dame in Paris, the 22d day of\nSeptember following.\n\nThe king of France, the dukes of Berry, Burgundy, and Bourbon, the king\nof Navarre, and several other princes, with prelates and churchmen\nwithout number, were present at his consecration. With the aid of the\ngrand master, his brother, the feast he gave on the occasion was the\nmost magnificent ever seen, in regard to the quantity of gold and\nsilver plate, and the diversity and abundance of meats and liquors.\nFrom this grand display, the princes observed that the grand master\ngoverned the king as he pleased; and they began to form suspicions as\nto the uprightness of his conduct.\n\nOn the 16th day of July following, duke Anthony of Brabant married, at\nBrussels, the niece of the king of Bohemia[32], heiress to the duchy\nof Luxembourg in right of her father. This marriage had been concluded\nby the mediation of the bishop of Ch\u00e2lons and sir Regnier Pot.\n\nSeveral knights, esquires, ladies and damsels of high rank, had\naccompanied the lady to Brussels, according to the orders of the king\nof Bohemia, her uncle. There were present at these nuptials the two\nbrothers of the duke of Brabant, the duke of Burgundy and the count de\nNevers, with their sister, wife to duke William count de Hainault; the\ncount de Charolois and the countess of Cleves, children to the duke of\nBurgundy; the marquis du Pont, his brother John[33] and their sister,\nthe countess de St Pol[34], all three children to the duke de Bar; the\ncounts de Namur and de Conversant, with their ladies, with many more of\nthe great nobility of both sexes.\n\nThe count de Clermont, son to the duke de Bourbon, was also there,--and\nwhen he tilted was attended by the duke of Burgundy and count de\nNevers. The duke bore his shield and the count his lance, to the\nsurprise of many present, on account of the great hatred that had so\nlately subsisted between them for the murder of the duke of Orleans:\nhowever, they seemed then to be in perfect concord. This feast was\nabundantly served with all sorts of provisions and wines,--and when it\nwas ended, the different guests retired to their respective countries.\n\nOn the last day but one of the same month of July, the marriage of the\ndaughter of the lord d\u2019Albret, constable of France, with the eldest\nson of Montagu[35], grand master of the king\u2019s household, was solemnly\ncelebrated. The queen of France and numbers of the great nobles were\npresent,--and the whole of the expense was paid by the king, which\ncreated much anger and envy in several of the princes of the blood\nagainst Montagu.\n\nAt this time, the truces were broken between the kings of France and of\nEngland, but only at sea; and a bitter naval war ensued, to the great\nloss of many merchants in each country.\n\nOn the 2d day of August, John de Lusignan, king of Cyprus, espoused by\nproxy, Charlotte de Bourbon, sister-german to the count de la Marche.\nThe ceremony was performed in the castle of Melun, in the presence of\nthe queen of France, the duke of Acquitaine and her other children,\nthe king of Navarre, the dukes of Berry and of Bourbon, the counts de\nla Marche and de Clermont, the lord Louis de Baviere, brother to the\nqueen, and many ladies and damsels, who greatly amused themselves in\ntournaments, dances, in feastings and other pastimes.\n\nThe lady Charlotte, queen of Cyprus, was very handsome, and well\nendowed with noble and gracious manners. On the conclusion of these\nfeasts, she departed for Cyprus, most honourably accompanied by the\nnobles so ordered by her brother, and also by those who had been sent\nto her from the king of Cyprus. She landed at the port of Chermes,\nwhither the king came to meet her, much rejoiced at her safe arrival,\nand conducted her, attended by the greater part of the nobility of\nthe island, to Nicosia, where were made many feasts, according to the\ncustom of the country. They reigned for a long time with much honour,\nand had two children, of whom more shall be spoken hereafter.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XI.\n\n    THE DUKE OF BURGUNDY HOLDS A GREAT COUNCIL AT LILLE ON HIS\n    AFFAIRS.--THE DEATH OF THE DUCHESS OF ORLEANS.\n\n\nOn the 5th of August, and the eight succeeding days, duke John of\nBurgundy held a grand council in his town of Lille, on his own affairs,\nand on the means of reconciling his brother and brother-in-law, the\nduke of Brabant and duke William of Holland, who had quarrelled for a\ncause before mentioned.\n\nWith these two dukes, there were also present the duke of Burgundy\u2019s\nsister, the wife of duke William, the bishop of Liege, and the count\nde Namur. At length, the duke of Burgundy made peace between them, on\ncondition that duke William should pay to the duke of Brabant, for all\nhis demand of debt, the sum of seventy thousand golden florins of the\ncoin of France, by different instalments.\n\nWhen this had been settled, the duke of Burgundy went, about the\nmiddle of August, to Paris, by orders from the king and royal council:\nhe was accompanied by many men at arms, whom he quartered in the\nvillages round Paris. The reason why he was attended by such a force\nwas, because the duke of Brittany had lately brought from England\ngreat numbers of English, and, in conjunction with his Bretons, was\ncarrying on a sharp war against the old countess of Penthievre[36]\nand her lands. The queen of France and the king\u2019s ministers were much\ndispleased at this conduct of the duke of Brittany, because it was to\nthe prejudice of the realm. The duke had increased this displeasure\nagainst him by having beaten and ill treated his duchess, daughter to\nthe king of France, for blaming him on account of his undertaking this\nwar.\n\nIt was therefore intended, that the duke of Burgundy should march the\nforces he had brought, attended by other princes and captains, against\nthe duke of Brittany, to conquer his country and oblige him to submit\nto the king. The duke of Burgundy was very desirous of succouring\nthe countess and her fair son, the count de Penthievre; but while the\npreparations were making, the duke of Brittany, informed by some of\nhis friends that he was in the ill graces of his mother in law, the\nqueen of France, and of those who governed the king, sent, by advice\nof his council, certain ambassadors to Paris, to offer to submit his\ndifferences with the countess de Penthievre to the king and council,\nwhich was at length accepted, through the interference of the king of\nNavarre.\n\nThe countess de Penthievre and her son were summoned to Paris, whither\nalso came the duke of Brittany, when, after some discussions, peace was\nmade between them.\n\nIn this same month, Isabella, the king of France\u2019s eldest daughter, and\ndowager queen of England, but wife to Charles duke of Orleans, died\nin childbed. The duke bitterly lamented her loss, but received some\nconsolation out of regard to the daughter she had brought him.\n\nThe patriarch of Alexandria, bishop of Carcassonne, succeeded Guy de\nRoye (whose murder has been noticed) in the archbishoprick of Rheims,\nand the archbishop of Bourges succeeded to the patriarchate. Doctor\nWilliam Bouratier, secretary to the king, was nominated archbishop\nof Bourges; and nearly about this time died doctor Peter Paoul, and\nwas succeeded in his dignities by doctor Gilles des Champs, almoner\nto the king. Louis de Harcourt, brother to the count de Harcourt, was\nappointed archbishop of Rouen.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XII.\n\n    THE TOWN OF GENOA REBELS AGAINST BOUCICAUT, MARSHAL OF FRANCE,\n    THE GOVERNOR, WHILE OBEYING A SUMMONS FROM THE DUKE OF MILAN.\n\n\nBoucicaut, marshal of France, was at this time governor of Genoa, and\nresided there. He was called upon by the duke of Milan and his brother,\nthe count of Pavia[37], to settle a dispute which had arisen between\nthem, respecting part of their dominions. He accepted the invitation,\nthinking he should do an agreeable service to the duke of Milan, and\nnot suspecting any trick in the matter. But during his absence, the\ninhabitants of Genoa rebelled against his government, and sent for some\nof their allies and accomplices to come to them.\n\nThey cruelly murdered the marshal\u2019s lieutenant, the chevalier de\nColletrie, named Chollette, a native of Auvergne, which the other\nFrenchmen hearing of, fled into the forts, for fear of suffering a\nsimilar fate. These were instantly besieged by the Genoese, who sent\nfor the marquis of Montferrat[38]: he lost no time in hastening to\ntheir aid with four thousand combatants, as they had promised to pay\nhim ten thousand florins yearly,--and they immediately elected him doge\nof Genoa. They also chose twelve knights, as a council to manage public\naffairs.\n\nA few days after, Fassincault[39], a very renowned captain in Italy,\nand a great friend of the marquis of Montferrat, came to Genoa with\nthe intent of assisting the marquis; but the Genoese refused to admit\nhim, or accept of his offers. On his return, his force, amounting\nto eight thousand men, took a town called Noefville; but the French\nretreated within the castle, which was instantly besieged.\n\nWhen Boucicaut heard of the rebellion of the Genoese, he set out\naccompanied by his men, and the duke of Milan and the count of Pavia,\nand arrived with speed at the castle of Gaing[40], situated between the\ntown of Noefville[41] and Genoa, and fought with Fassincault and his\nforces. In this battle, eight hundred men were slain, the greater part\nbelonging to Fassincault,--and night alone separated the combatants.\n\nBoucicaut, by the advice of Enguerrand de Bournouville and Gaiffier\nde la Salle, both men at arms of acknowledged prowess, advanced that\nnight to the castle of Gaing, which he won, and amply provided it with\nprovision and all necessary stores. Fassincault remained in the town;\nbut seeing he could not gain the castle, he departed with his men to\nhis own fortresses.\n\nThe marshal Boucicaut carried on a severe warfare against the Genoese\nand those who had assisted them. He also sent messengers to inform\nthe king of France of his situation, and to require that he would\nimmediately send him reinforcements of men at arms.--The king and his\ngreat council, on receiving this intelligence and considering the\nfickleness of the Genoese, determined to proceed cautiously against\nthem. The king sent, at his expense, the lords de Torsy, de Rambures,\nand de Viefville, with a certain number of men at arms, to the city of\nAsti, belonging to the duke of Orleans, and near to the territory of\nGenoa, with the hope of affording assistance to Boucicaut.\n\nOn their arrival at Asti, they found that the whole country was in\nrebellion, excepting some forts, which held out for the French; but as\nthey were without the town, and could not contain many men, from dread\nof wanting provision, they were not of consequence, nor could they do\nmuch mischief. The above knights, therefore, perceiving they could not\nperform any essential services, resolved to return to France.\n\nAll merchants, and others who came from or had any connexions with\nGenoa, were now sought after in Paris, arrested and imprisoned, and\ntheir goods confiscated to the king\u2019s use. Now these Genoese had for a\nlong time been under obedience to the king, and had diligently served\nhim in many of his wars.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XIII.\n\n    THE PRINCES OF THE BLOOD ASSEMBLE, AND RESOLVE TO REFORM THE\n    MANAGEMENT OF THE ROYAL FINANCES.--THE DEATH OF MONTAGU.\n\n\nAt this period, the following princes of the blood,--Louis king of\nNavarre[42], the dukes of Berry, Burgundy, and Bourbon, and many other\ngreat lords, were at Paris; and having learnt that the king\u2019s treasury\nwas impoverished by his officers and those who governed him, insomuch\nthat his plate and the greater part of his jewels were in pawn, they\none day personally explained to the king, in the presence of the queen,\nthe duke of Acquitaine and others of his council, the miserable state\nof his finances, and the unworthy government of the officers of his\nhousehold. They at the same time requested, that he would be pleased\nto permit that some of them should have power to reform in general the\nabuses that had commenced with his reign, and to call to an account,\ndismiss, and punish all who should have mismanaged the finances,\naccording as the cases might require, without any exception whatever.\n\nThis request the king granted; and for the better carrying on their\nobject, the greater part of the lords before mentioned left their\nown h\u00f4tels, and resided in the king\u2019s palace of St Pol, where, with\nthe advice of the members of the parliament and the university, they\ncontinued their reformations for many days.\n\nThey soon discovered that those who had managed the finances for the\nlast sixteen or twenty years had very dishonestly acquitted themselves,\nand had acquired for themselves and their friends immense fortunes,\nto the prejudice of the state. Montagu, who had been the principal\nminister of finance, was particularly the object they aimed at,--and\nthey ordered him, with several others, to be arrested and confined in\nthe prisons of the Ch\u00e2telet.\n\nSir Peter des Essars, provost of Paris, was directed to put this order\ninto execution, with his sergeants; and by the command of the duke of\nBurgundy, the lords de Heylly, de Robais, and sir Roland de Vequerque,\nwere appointed to assist the provost in this duty. Having assembled\ntogether, they, on a certain day, met Montagu, and with him the doctor,\nMartin Gouge, bishop of Chartres, both going to hear mass at the\nmonastery of St Victor.\n\nThe provost, attended by the above lords, on meeting them, laid his\nhands on both, saying, \u2018I lay hands on you by virtue of the royal\nauthority vested in me for this purpose.\u2019--Montagu, hearing these\nwords, was much astonished, and trembled greatly; but his courage soon\nreturned, and he replied to the provost, \u2018What! rascal, art thou daring\nenough to lay hands on me?\u2019 But the provost answered, \u2018Matters will\nnot turn out as you think,--for you must make reparation for the many\nand great mischiefs you have done.\u2019\n\nMontagu, unable to resist, was tightly bound by the provost, and\ncarried by him straight to the little Ch\u00e2telet. The bishop of Chartres\nwas arrested with him, as he had been president of one of the financial\ndepartments. Montagu was several times put to the torture, insomuch\nthat, suspecting his end was approaching, he asked his confessor what\nhe had best do: the confessor replied, \u2018I see no other remedy than your\nappealing from the jurisdiction of the provost of Paris.\u2019 This he did;\nand the provost waited on the lords who had commanded him to arrest\nMontagu, to inform them, that he had appealed against his jurisdiction.\nThe parliament was consequently convoked to examine into the matter;\nand the members of it declared the appeal of no effect. The lords,\ntherefore, seeing the cause had been judged, said to the provost, \u2018Go,\nwithout delay, accompanied by some of the populace well armed, take thy\nprisoner, and finish the matter by cutting off his head with an axe,\nand fix it on a lance in the market-place.\u2019\n\nAfter these words, the populace armed themselves, and, on the 17th\nof October, assembled in bodies in the place Maubert, and in other\nparts of the town. They carried Montagu to a scaffold erected in the\nmarket place, where, having made him strip to his shirt, they cut off\nhis head, and fixed it to the end of a pike, and hung his body by the\nshoulders to the highest gibbet at Montfaucon. This execution was\nchiefly owing, as it was said, to the duke of Burgundy\u2019s hatred to him,\nwho even sent for a very great number of the nobles of his countries of\nBurgundy, Flanders, and Artois, to be spectators of it.\n\nA little before this execution took place, the duke of Bourbon, and\nhis son the count de Clermont, left Paris, indignant at the arrest of\nMontagu. The duke of Orleans, his brothers, and all of their party,\nwere also very much displeased that he was put to death,--but they\ncould not help it, for at that time they were not listened to by the\nking\u2019s council.\n\nOn the morrow of this event, duke William count of Hainault arrived at\nParis, having been sent for by the duke of Burgundy. A large company of\nthe nobles went out of the town to meet him; and he was most graciously\nreceived by the king, the duke of Acquitaine and the other princes. On\nhis arrival, the h\u00f4tel that had belonged to Montagu was given to him,\nwith all its furniture, for it had been confiscated to the king\u2019s use;\nand duke William took instant possession.\n\nThe castle of Marcoussi, which had been built by Montagu, was seized\nby the king: it is situated seven leagues from Paris, on the road to\nChartres. Montagu was born in Paris, and had first been secretary\nto the king: he was the son of Gerard de Montagu, who had also been\nsecretary to Charles V. He was of noble birth by his mother\u2019s side, and\nhad three daughters, two of whom were married; the elder to John[43]\ncount de Roussy, the second to Peter de Craon, lord of Montbason;\nand the third was betrothed to John de Melun, son to the lord\nd\u2019Antoing[44], but the match was broken off: his son was married to the\ndaughter of the lord d\u2019Albret, constable of France and cousin to the\nking, as has been related.\n\nAfter this, the provost of Paris arrested many of the king\u2019s officers,\nparticularly those who had been concerned in the finances and in\nmatters of revenue. All the principals in the department of the\ngeneralities, the presidents and others of the chamber of accounts,\nPerrin Pillot, a merchant, with several others, were imprisoned in the\nLouvre and in other places of confinement.\n\nWhen the borgne de Foucal, equerry to the king, and keeper of that\ndepartment of the treasury called the Epargne, heard that the grand\nmaster of the household was arrested, he was greatly astonished and\ntroubled, and, instantly changing his dress, mounted a fleet horse, and\nsecretly left Paris. This caused him to be much suspected of improper\nconduct by the princes who were examining into these matters.\n\nAt this period, the archbishop of Sens, brother to the grand master,\nGuichart Daulphin, William de Tignonville, knights, and master Goutier\nCol, secretary to the king, were sent, by orders from the king, to meet\nthe english ambassadors at Amiens. The archbishop, hearing of the\narrest and imprisonment of his brother, took leave of his companions,\nand set out from Amiens: but as he was journeying toward Paris, he was\nmet by one of the king\u2019s ushers, who made him his prisoner; for he had\norders so to do from the king, and confine him at Amiens, should he\nchance to find him there.\n\nThe archbishop very prudently replied, that he was ready to follow him\nto prison or to death; but when they came to the river Oise, near the\npriory of St Leu de Cherens, he played the usher a trick. On leaving\nthe ferry boat with a few of his people, he mounted the fleetest of his\nhorses, and galloped off, leaving the usher on the other side waiting\nfor the return of the ferry-boat; but, thunderstruck at his being so\ncheated, he returned to Paris without his prisoner.\n\nThe lord de Tignonville, having been a member of the chamber of\naccounts, was, by command of the princes, arrested by the bailiff of\nAmiens, and confined in his prison. But after a short time, he, the\nbishop of Chartres, and the other prisoners at Paris, were suspended\nfrom their offices, and, having given bail, were permitted to go about\nParis, or wherever they pleased.\n\nThe princes, not being able to attend sufficiently to these matters\nof reform from their other occupations of greater weight, appointed\na commission to examine carefully into them, which commission was\ncomposed of the counts de la Marche, de Vend\u00f4me and de St Pol, with\nsome members of the parliament.\n\nThe men at arms that had been called together round Paris by the duke\nof Burgundy and others were disbanded; and each, as they returned to\nthe places whence they had come, devoured the substance of the poor\npeople, according to the custom of that time.\n\nSir Guichart Daulphin[45], before mentioned, was, by the princes,\nappointed grand master of the king\u2019s household in the room of the\nmurdered Montagu; for the king was then troubled with his usual\ndisorder.\n\nThe bishop of Paris now requested of the princes, that they would, in\ntheir mercy, permit him to have the body of his brother taken down from\nthe gibbet, and, with many tears and supplications, petitioned for\nleave to bury him. But neither of these requests was granted him by the\nprinces; on which the bishop, ashamed of the disgraceful death of one\nbrother and the flight of another, the archbishop of Sens, soon after\nquitted his see, and taking with him his sister-in-law, the widow of\nMontagu, and some of their children, for the duke of Berry had already\nappointed another chancellor, went to the estate of his sister-in-law\nin Savoy: she was the daughter of sir Stephen de la Grange, formerly\npresident of the parliament, and brother to the cardinal d\u2019Amiens.\n\nThe borgne de Foucal, not answering to the proclamations that were\nmade for his appearance, was banished the realm of France, by sound\nof trumpet in the four quarters of Paris. In like manner were the\narchbishop of Sens and many other fugitives banished the kingdom.\n\nThe king of Navarre, the dukes of Berry, Burgundy and Holland, with the\ncounts de Vend\u00f4me and de la Marche, and several great lords, waited on\nthe queen of France and the duke of Acquitaine, to make them acquainted\nwith the reasons for the executing Montagu, and what progress they had\nmade in the reformation of abuses, and the measures they had pursued\nagainst such as were criminal. The queen testified her satisfaction,\nand was contented that they should proceed as they had began. She was,\nhowever, far from being pleased with the duke of Burgundy, whom she\ndreaded, from the great power he was now possessed of, more than any of\nthe other princes, although he treated her respectfully in his speech.\n\nThe marriage of the lord Louis of Bavaria, brother to the queen, was\nagain talked of with the daughter of the king of Navarre; and he was\npresented with the castle of Marcoussi, with all its furniture and\nappurtenances, which had lately been confiscated to the king, by the\ndeath of Montagu, which was very agreeable to the queen.\n\nAfter these lords had for some days transacted business at Melun, where\nthe court was, they all returned to Paris, carrying with them master\nPeter Bosthet, president of the parliament, and some members of the\nchamber of accounts, and assembled daily to inquire after those persons\nwho had been in the receipt and expenditure of the public revenues.\n\nDuring this time, the king, who had been very ill, was restored\nto health, insomuch that on the 2d day of December, he rode from\nhis palace of St Pol, dressed in a hauberk under his robes, to the\ncathedral church of N\u00f4tre Dame, where he made his prayers, a page\ncarrying behind him a very handsome steel helmet and a moorish lance.\nHaving finished his prayers, he returned to his palace of Saint Pol.\n\nOn the morrow, he held a royal council in person, at which were present\nthe king of Navarre, the dukes of Berry, Burgundy, and of Bourbon,\nwhich last was lately returned to Paris. It was there resolved, that\nthe king should summon the following lords to attend him personally\nat the ensuing feast of Christmas, namely, the dukes of Orleans, of\nBrittany, of Brabant, of Bar, and of Lorraine: the counts of Savoy[46],\nof Alen\u00e7on, of Penthievre, of Namur, of Harcourt, of Armagnac[47],\nand in general all the great lords within his realm of France and\nDauphiny, with many prelates and other noblemen. After this summons of\nthe king, the duke of Burgundy gave orders for a large body of men at\narms to be collected in his countries of Flanders, Artois and Burgundy,\nfor the safety of his person.\n\nShortly after this council, duke William count of Hainault went to\nMelun, the residence of the queen of France, who was his near relation;\nand so managed that she, who could not bear the duke of Burgundy, and\nhad strongly supported the party adverse to him, namely, that of my\nlord the duke of Orleans, was reconciled to him.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XIV.\n\n    DUKE LOUIS OF BAVARIA ESPOUSES THE DAUGHTER OF THE KING OF\n    NAVARRE.--THE NAMES OF THE LORDS WHO CAME TO PARIS IN OBEDIENCE\n    TO THE KING\u2019S ORDERS.\n\n\nAbout this time, duke Louis of Bavaria was married at Melun to the\ndaughter of the king of Navarre, according to what has been before\nmentioned. She had previously married the eldest son of the king of\nArragon[48], who had lately been slain in a battle between him and the\nviscount de Narbonne and the Sardinians, which took place in Sardinia.\nThere was much feasting at this wedding, which was attended by many\nlords, ladies and damsels.\n\nAbout Christmas the greater part of those lords whom the king had\nsummoned, arrived at Paris: the duke of Orleans and his brothers,\nhowever, did not come. On the eve of Christmas-day, the king went to\nthe palace to hold his state, and remained there until St Thomas\u2019s day,\nwhere he celebrated most solemnly the feast of the nativity of our Lord.\n\nOn this day the following persons were seated at the king\u2019s table at\ndinner: on his right, doctor William Bouratier, archbishop of Bourges,\nwho had said the mass, next to him was the cardinal de Bar. The king\nwas seated at the middle of the table, very magnificently dressed in\nhis royal robes. On his left were the dukes of Berry and Burgundy. A\ngreat variety of ornamental plate was produced in gold and silver,\nwhich were wont to be served before the king on high feasts, but which\nhad not for some time been seen, because they had been pawned to\nMontagu, and had been found after his death in his castle of Marcoussi,\nand in other places where he had hidden them.\n\nBy orders from the princes of the blood they had been replaced, as\nusual, in the king\u2019s palace, which was a very agreeable sight to the\nnobles and people of Paris, from their regard to the honour of the\nking\u2019s person, and his royal state.\n\nA great many princes and others had obeyed the king\u2019s summons, and\nwere at this feast,--namely, the king of Navarre, the dukes of Berry,\nBurgundy, Bourbon, Brabant, duke William count of Hainault, the duke of\nLorraine, duke Louis of Bavaria, brother to the queen,--and nineteen\ncounts, namely, the count de Mortain, brother to the king of Navarre,\nthe count de Nevers, the count de Clermont, the marquis du Pont, son\nto the duke of Bar, the count de Vaudemont, the count d\u2019Alen\u00e7on, the\ncount de Vend\u00f4me, the count de Penthievre, the count de St Pol, the\ncount de Cleves, the count de Tancarville, the count d\u2019Angy[49], the\ncount de Namur, and several others, to the aforesaid amount. The number\nof knights who accompanied these princes was so great that, from the\nreport of the heralds, they were more than eighteen hundred knights,\nwithout including esquires.\n\nNevertheless, there were not in this noble company the duke of Orleans\nnor his brothers, nor the duke of Brittany, nor the lord d\u2019Albret,\nconstable of France, nor the counts de Foix, d\u2019Armagnac, and many other\npotent lords, although they had been summoned by the king in like\nmanner as the others.\n\nOn St Thomas\u2019s day, after the king had feasted his nobles in royal\nstate, the queen, by orders from the king, came from the castle of\nVincennes to Paris. All the princes, prelates, and great crowds of\npeople, went out to meet her and her son, the duke of Acquitaine, and\nconducted her to the palace, where they presented her to the king, in\nthe presence of all the before-mentioned lords. Her son had visited\nhis government, to be properly instructed in arms, and other necessary\nmatters, that he might be the better qualified to rule his kingdom when\nit should fall to him.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XV.\n\n    THE KING OF FRANCE KEEPS ROYAL STATE IN HIS PALACE, WHEREIN\n    SEVERAL OF THE GREAT LORDS BEFORE MENTIONED HOLD MANY COUNCILS\n    ON THE STATE OF THE NATION.\n\n\nIn consequence of several meetings having been held in the presence of\nthe king, queen, and duke of Acquitaine, the king ordered the great\nhall of the palace to be magnificently prepared for a royal sessions.\nThither were summoned all the principal noblemen, prelates and others,\nwhen the king appeared seated in his regal robes. On one side of him\nwere the king of Navarre and the cardinal de Bar, and on the other\nthe duke of Acquitaine, the duke of Berry, and all the other princes\nand nobles, each seated according to his rank: in like manner were\nthe prelates, knights, and clergy, and a multitude of others, seated\naccording to their respective situations in life.\n\nThen, by the king\u2019s commands, the count de Tancarville, an able and\neloquent man, harangued with a loud and clear voice, how Richard\nlate king of England, and son-in-law to the king, had been basely and\ntreacherously put to death, during the time of a truce, by Henry of\nLancaster, calling himself king of England, but then earl of Derby, in\nconjunction with his partisans, as might be fully proved by several of\nthe English, near relations of the deceased king Richard:--And also how\nthe young prince of Scotland, an ally to the king, when on his voyage\nto France, was taken by this same Henry, and detained his prisoner for\na long time; as were likewise many Scots, who were in the company of\nthe prince of Wales. Yvain Graindos[50], with several of his Welshmen,\nallies also to the king, notwithstanding the aforesaid truce, were by\nthe English harrassed with war. The eldest son likewise to the prince\nof Wales was made captive[51], carried to England, and imprisoned by\nHenry for a considerable time.\n\n\u2018In consequence of the facts above stated, the king thinks he may,\nwithout further consideration, lawfully wage war against the said\nHenry and his english subjects, without giving them any respite.\nNotwithstanding this,\u2019 continued the orator, \u2018the king is desirous that\nwhatever he may please to order should be for the common welfare of the\nstate; and for this purpose a royal sessions has been held, for every\none to consider these matters and what ought to be the line of conduct\nfor him to pursue,--and, having an opinion thereon, if they will inform\nthe king or his council thereof, the king will thank them and follow\nthat advice which shall seem to him the most advantageous for the\ngeneral good.\n\nUpon this, the eldest of the princes of the blood, namely, the king\u2019s\nuncle the duke of Berry, arose from his seat, and, advancing in front\nof the king\u2019s throne, fell on his knees, and, speaking for himself and\nthe other princes of the blood, declared they would relinquish, to the\nuse of the state, all taxes and impositions which they annually levied\non their lands,--and in like manner would they relinquish all the fees\nand perquisites of office which they were in the habit of receiving\nfrom their places under the king, and as the members of his council.\n\nThe king kindly listened to the duke\u2019s speech, and accepted his offers,\nand then commanded him to be reseated. The lord Tancarville continued\nhis harangue, saying, that the king, then present, revoked all pensions\nand grants which he had given, and thus publicly annulled them. In\nregard to the reformation and future management of the finances, the\nking declared his intention that such regulations as should be ordered\nby himself, and by the advice of the count de la Marche (who had now\nlost his wife, the daughter of the king of Navarre), his brother the\ncount de Vend\u00f4me, the count de Saint Pol, and the other commissioners\nfrom the parliament, should be fully executed without excepting any\nperson whatever; and that the reformations by them proposed should take\nplace, as well in the chambers of accounts as in the generalities and\nin the household of the king,--and that all receivers, comptrollers,\nand all persons any way interested in the management of the finances\nof the realm, whether bishops or archbishops, and of what rank soever,\nshould be subjected to them.\u2019 The orator continued,--\u2018That the king\nwilled and ordered, that during his absence, the queen should call\nto her assistance some of the princes of the royal blood, and should\ngovern the affairs of this kingdom according as she might judge most\nconducive to its welfare; and in case of the absence of the queen, the\nduke of Acquitaine, his son, then present, should govern the kingdom,\nwith the assistance of the dukes of Berry and Burgundy.\u2019\n\nWhen the lord de Tancarville had more fully enlarged on the above\nmatters, and concluded his speech, the king descended from his royal\nthrone, and, with a small company, entered his apartment to dinner; and\nthe whole assembly broke up, and departed to their h\u00f4tels.\n\nAfter the dinner, the queen set out with her attendants for the castle\nof Vincennes, as it was the eve of the feast of the Circumcision, but\nleft her son with the king. On the morrow, the feast-day, the duke of\nBurgundy (who had alone more princes, knights, and gentlemen attached\nto him than all the other princes together,) gave presents of jewels\nand rich gifts, of greater magnificence than any one, according to the\ncustom of that day. He made presents to all the knights and nobles of\nhis household, to the amount, as was estimated, of fifteen thousand\ngolden florins, of medals formed like to a mason\u2019s level, of gold and\nsilver gilt; and at the pointed ends of these levels was fastened a\nsmall gilt chain, with a plummet of gold, so that it might be used as a\nrule.\n\nItem, on Twelfth-day following, Louis king of Sicily, having been sent\nfor by the king, entered Paris. He came from the city of Pisa, whither\nhe had gone to visit pope Alexander V. and made his entry, attended by\nnumbers of the nobility and clergy, who had gone out to meet him.\n\nShortly after, the cardinal de Thurey came to Paris, as ambassador from\nthe pope to the king, who most honourably received him, as he likewise\ndid Philibert de Lignac, grand master of Rhodes, and chief of the order\nof St John of Jerusalem, who had come from England.\n\nThe king now disbanded all the troops he had collected, as did the duke\nof Burgundy, excepting about one hundred or six score gentlemen, whom\nhe retained, with those of his household, to guard his person: the\nothers returned to their homes.\n\nBefore the duke of Burgundy left Paris, the duke of Acquitaine, with\nthe consent of the king and queen, was intrusted to his care and\nguardianship, that he might be properly instructed in the arts of war\nand government. He had been very anxious to obtain this, and had caused\nseveral of the princes of the blood to press the matter: even his\nuncle, the duke of Berry, had, on this account, more than once refused\nthe queen to accept of the guardianship of the duke of Acquitaine;\nbut had so urged the business that the lord de Dolhaing[52], knight,\nhis principal esquire, counsellor and advocate, had, by the earnest\ndesire of the queen, been made chancellor to the duke of Acquitaine,\nand the lord de Saint George his first chamberlain. The government\nof the castles of Crotoy and Beaurain-sur-Canche were granted to the\nduke of Berry for his life, on giving the preceding governors the\nusual pension, in whose room he appointed two of his own knights; the\nlord de Croy to Crotoy, and the lord de Humbercourt to Beaurain; and\nsir Reginald Pot was, at his request, appointed governor of Dauphiny\nfor the dauphin. Soon after this, the king relapsed into his usual\ndisorder, and was put under good guard. Those who were intrusted with\nthe reform of abuses continued daily at work, and with such success\nthat large sums were recovered from the late directors of the finances.\n\nAt this period, the princes and council of state went often to the\ncastle of Vincennes, where the queen resided,--for without her\nknowledge no business of any importance was carried on. The dukes of\nBerry and Bourbon, however, were much discontented that they were not\nso often summoned to the council as before, and that their authority\nwas greatly lessened. Seeing themselves, as it were, banished from the\ngovernment, they took leave of the king, queen, and princes, and each\nretired to his own domains.\n\nThe cardinal de Thurey had come to Paris to solicit the university\nand council of state to consent that pope Alexander might levy\ntwo-tenths on the gallican church, to defray the great expenses he was\nbound to pay. This request was not granted, because the university\nopposed it, in the name of the whole church. The better to effect\nthis, the university required and obtained a royal mandate, to\ncommand all officers under the crown forcibly to send out of their\njurisdictions all persons who should come thither making similar\ndemands. The solicitors of this levy had brought to Paris with them\na bull containing many novelties, which were not usually advanced,\nnamely, that the tythes, and other things, such as oblations to the\nchurch, belonged to them in preference to the parochial clergy, for\nthat in fact they were in the same capacity, inasmuch as whoever should\nconfess themselves to them were not under the necessity of so doing to\ntheir own clergyman. This doctrine they publicly preached throughout\nParis, and the members of the university preached in opposition to it,\nso that during Lent the whole town was in confusion and discord by\nthese quarrels of the university and the mendicants, until they were\ndriven out of it by the university. The Jacobins, however, as the most\nprudent, renounced the bull, and made oath that they would never claim\nany advantages from it, nor from other privileges that had been granted\nto them. By this means, they were reconciled to the university. The\npope, at this period, held his court with great state in Bologna la\nGrassa.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XVI.\n\n    A GREAT DISSENSION TAKES PLACE THIS YEAR BETWEEN THE KING OF\n    POLAND, ON THE ONE HAND, AND THE GRAND MASTER OF PRUSSIA AND\n    HIS KNIGHTS ON THE OTHER.\n\n\nThis year, a great quarrel arose between the king of Poland and the\ngrand master of the Teutonic order in Prussia; and the king assembled a\nlarge force from different nations, which he marched into Prussia, with\nthe intent to destroy it.\n\nThe grand master and his brethren soon made themselves ready to meet\nhim with a great army, and showed every inclination to give him battle;\nbut when the two armies were in sight of each other, through the will\nof God, the king of Poland retreated with his forces, among which were\ntwenty thousand Tartars at least, without counting his Polanders and\nothers his Christian allies, who were very numerous, and returned to\nhis own country.\n\nAfterward, the king of Lithuania, by the exhortations of the king of\nPoland, invaded Prussia with an immense army, and destroyed the greater\npart which lay on the sea-shores. The Prussians made a thousand of them\nprisoners, and slew many.\n\nThe king of Poland was formerly an infidel, and son to the king of\nLithuania, but, having a great ambition to reign, murdered his father,\nand was for this crime banished the country. He took refuge with the\nthen king of Poland, who received him kindly, and admitted him into his\nfriendship and confidence. He also gained the affections of the princes\nand nobles, insomuch that, on the death of their king, they unanimously\nelected this parricide to succeed him, had him baptised, and married\nhim to the widow of the late king; and, since that time, he has happily\nenough governed that kingdom[53].\n\nAt this period, Sigismond king of Hungary, brother to the king of\nBohemia, took to wife the sister of the above queen of Poland: they\nwere daughters to a german count, called the count de Cilly, of the\nroyal branch of Hungary[54]. The king of Poland laid claim to Hungary\nin right of his wife, and thence took occasion to harrass that country\nas well as Prussia. He sent secret messengers to the king of Lithuania,\nhis cousin german and ally, to press him to invade Prussia on the\nquarter nearest the sea, when he would march his Polanders to form a\njunction and destroy the whole of it. His intentions were discovered\nby the messenger being arrested by orders of the king of Hungary, and\ninformation sent of them to Prussia, whenceforward the king of Hungary\nand grand master took such wise precautions that his future attempts\nwere fruitless.\n\n\n\n\n[A. D. 1410.]\n\nCHAP. XVII.\n\n    THE DUKE OF BERRY, BY THE KING\u2019S COMMANDS, RETURNS TO\n    PARIS.--THE MARRIAGE OF THE SON OF THE KING OF SICILY.--THE\n    ASSEMBLY THAT IS HOLDEN AT MEUN LE CHASTEL.\n\n\nThis year, the duke of Berry was, by the king\u2019s orders, remanded to\nParis, and, on his arrival, was sent, with the king of Navarre, to\nGiens sur Loire, to put an end to the quarrels between the duke of\nBrittany and the count and countess of Penthievre. Although both\nparties had promised to meet them, they did not personally attend, but\nsent commissioners.\n\nThe king of Navarre and the duke of Berry took great pains, and\nproposed various means, to bring about a reconciliation. Finding all\ntheir attempts fruitless, they referred the whole matter, with the\nconsent of the commissioners, to the king\u2019s decision on All-saints-day\nnext coming, and then they returned to Paris.\n\nIn this year was concluded the marriage between the eldest son of Louis\nking of Sicily, and Catherine, daughter to the duke of Burgundy. The\nlady was conducted by sir John de Ch\u00e2lons, lord de Darlay, the lord de\nSt George, sir William de Champdivers, and sir James de Courtjambe, to\nAngers, and there delivered to the queen of Sicily, who received her\nmost affectionately and honourably,--and she magnificently entertained\nthe knights who had brought her. After a short stay at Angers, they\nreturned to their lord, the duke of Burgundy, at Paris.\n\nAt this time, the dukes of Orleans and Bourbon, the counts de Clermont,\nd\u2019Alen\u00e7on, d\u2019Armagnac, the lord Charles d\u2019Albreth, constable, and many\nother lords of great power and authority, held a meeting in the town\nof Meun le Ch\u00e2tel,--where they had several long consultations with\neach other on the state of public affairs, and particularly as to the\nmurder of the late duke of Orleans, principally to consider how they\nshould proceed to take vengeance on the person who had committed it.\nMany different opinions were urged: one was, that the duke of Orleans\nshould declare a deadly war against him, and carry it on by every\npossible means, with the assistance of his relations, friends, and the\nwellwishers to his cause.\n\nOthers said, it would be better to follow another course, and\nremonstrate strongly to the king, their sovereign lord, on the\nnecessity he was under to do strict justice on the duke of Burgundy,\nto which he was the more particularly bound, as the murder was\ncommitted on his own brother. But, as they could not all agree in the\nsame opinion, they broke up the meeting, and appointed another day to\nassemble again.\n\nBefore they separated, a treaty of marriage was entered upon between\nCharles duke of Orleans and the daughter of the count d\u2019Armagnac. She\nwas niece to the duke of Berry by her mother\u2019s side, and sister[55]\nto the count de Savoye. This done, the lords departed for their own\ndomains.\n\nThe duke of Burgundy resided in Paris, and ruled there more\ndespotically than any other of the princes: affairs were solely carried\non by him and his partisans, which, no doubt, made very many jealous of\nhim.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XVIII.\n\n    THE KING OF SICILY GOES TO PROVENCE AND TO BOLOGNA, TO MEET HIS\n    RIVAL KING LADISLAUS.--THE DEATH OF POPE ALEXANDER, AND THE\n    ELECTION OF POPE JOHN.\n\n\nAbout this period, Louis king of Sicily set out from Paris with a\nnumerous body of men at arms, and went for Provence, and thence to\nBologna, to meet king Ladislaus, his opponent, and to defend his\nkingdom of Naples, where his rival was committing great devastation.\nKing Louis had for this raised so considerable a force, that he might\nbe enabled to offer him combat; and he had also the hope that pope\nAlexander would assist him, to the utmost of his ability, in money and\nin men.\n\nAn end was soon put to his expectations in this respect; for, on the\nmorrow of the feast of the discovery of the holy cross, pope Alexander\nwas poisoned in the town of Bologna, as was currently reported, and\ndied most pitifully. His bowels were interred, and his obsequies were\nperformed in the church of the Cordeliers. Mass was celebrated by the\ncardinal de Vimers: the deacon and under deacon were the cardinals\nd\u2019Espaigne and de Thurey. The whole court was dressed in deep mourning.\n\nThe 6th of May, the corpse of the pope, having been embalmed with fine\nspices, was placed in the hall of audience, dressed in his papal robes,\nhis face uncovered, gloves on his hands, but his feet naked, so that\nwhoever pleased might kiss them,--and nine funeral services were there\nperformed.\n\nThere were present twenty cardinals, two patriarchs, four archbishops,\ntwenty-four bishops, with many prelates, abbots, and other churchmen.\nHis escutcheon of arms were placed at the four corners of his coffin;\nand for nine days, masses were celebrated in the same manner as on the\nmorrow of his death. The masses were said by the cardinals in rotation;\nand the ninth day, the body was carried to the Cordeliers for interment.\n\nThe two first bearers were the cardinals de Vimers and de Challant,\nand the two last the cardinals d\u2019Espaigne and de Thurey. The cardinal\nMilles preceded the body bearing a cross. The chorists were the\ncardinals de Bar, (not the son of the duke of Bar, but the cardinal of\nBar[56] in Calabria), and d\u2019Orsini. The cardinal de Vimers performed\nthe service, as he had done at the interment of the bowels.\n\nWhen this ceremony was over, the cardinals returned home dressed in\nblack; and after dinner, they assembled at the palace, and entered\ninto conclave, where they remained shut up from the Wednesday to the\nSaturday following. Some of the cardinals, having consulted together,\nproposed Balthazar, cardinal of Bologna, as sovereign pontiff of\nthe universal church; and the others, who were not of this opinion,\nseeing their numbers were very small, consented to it; and the new\npope was conducted by them to the church of St Peter, where they placed\nthe tiara on his head, and took the oaths of fidelity to him. They\nthen led him to the palace of his predecessor, where every piece of\nfurniture had been carried off, and there did not remain even a door or\nwindow-frame.\n\nOn the morrow, he took the name of pope John XXIII. and great were the\nrejoicings and feasts that ensued. In the procession were twenty-three\ncardinals, two patriarchs, three archbishops, twenty-seven abbots,\nmitred and non-mitred, without reckoning other churchmen, who were\nalmost numberless. The pope wore on that day a silver-gilt tiara bound\nwith white. The following Saturday, the 23d of May, the pope received,\nin the chapel of his predecessors, the holy order of priesthood, when\nthe cardinal de Vimers said the mass, and the cardinal de Challant was\ndeacon: at this service, all the before-named prelates attended.\n\nOn the following day, Sunday, the pope celebrated mass in the church\nof St Peter, having the cardinal de Vimers near him to show him the\nservice. The marquis of Ferrara and the lord of Malatesta were present,\nand held the bason wherein the pope washed his hands. The marquis of\nFerrara had brought with him fifty-four knights, all clothed in scarlet\nand blue, having five trumpets and four companies of minstrels, each\nplaying on a different instrument.\n\nWhen mass was finished, pope John was carried out of the church to a\nvery handsome platform erected without the porch, and there solemnly\ncrowned in the presence of all those whom I have mentioned, and a great\nmultitude of doctors and clergy.\n\nWhen seated on his throne, which was covered all over with cloth of\ngold, he was surrounded by the cardinals de Vimers, de Challant, de\nMilles, d\u2019Espaigne, de Thurey, and de Bar, having tufts of tow in their\nhands. The cardinals lighted their tufts; and as the flame was suddenly\nextinguished, they addressed the pope, saying, \u2018Thus, holy father,\npasses the glory of this world!\u2019 This was done three times.\n\nThe cardinal de Vimers having said some prayers over him and on the\ncrown, placed it upon his head. This crown was a triple one: the first\nof gold, which encircled the forehead within the mitre; the second\nof gold and silver, about the middle of the mitre; and the third, of\nvery fine gold, surmounted it. He was then led down from the platform,\nand placed on a horse covered over with scarlet furniture. The horses\nof the cardinals and bishops, &c. were caparisoned in white; and in\nthis state he was conducted from street to street, making every where\nthe sign of the cross, until he came to where the Jews resided, who\npresented him with a manuscript of the Old Testament. He took it with\nhis own hand, and, having examined it a little, threw it behind him,\nsaying, \u2018Your religion is good, but this of ours is better.\u2019\n\nAs he departed, the Jews followed him, intending to touch him,--in the\nattempt of which, the caparison of his horse was all torn.--Wherever\nhe passed, the pope distributed money,--that is to say, quadrini and\nmailles of Florence, with other coins. There were before and behind him\ntwo hundred men at arms, each having in his hand a leathern mallet,\nwith which they struck the Jews in such wise as it was a pleasure to\nsee.\n\nOn the morrow, he returned to his palace, accompanied by the cardinals\ndressed in crimson,--the patriarchs in like manner,--the archbishops\nand bishops in similar dresses, having white mitres on their heads,\nand numbers of mitred and non-mitred abbots. In this procession were,\nthe marquis of Ferrara[57], the lord Malatesta[58], the lord of\nGaucourt[59], and others, to the amount of forty-four, as well dukes as\ncounts and knights of Italy, all dressed out in their liveries. In each\nstreet, two and two by turns led the pope\u2019s horse by the bridle,--the\none on the right hand, and another on the left.\n\nThere were thirty-six bagpipes and trumpets, and ten bands of minstrels\nplaying on musical instruments, each band consisting of three\nperformers. There were also singers, especially those of the chapel of\nhis predecessor, as well as those belonging to the cardinals and from\ndifferent parts of Italy, who rode before the pope loudly chaunting\nvarious airs, sacred and profane.\n\nWhen he arrived at the palace, he gave his peace to all the cardinals,\nwho, according to their rank in the college, kissed his foot, hand, or\nmouth. The cardinal de Vimers first performed the ceremony, and was\nfollowed by the other cardinals, patriarchs, archbishops, bishops,\nabbots and clergy. He then gave his benediction to the four elements,\nand to all persons in a state of grace, as well to those absent as\npresent, and bestowed his dispensations for four months to come,\nprovided that, during this time, three Pater-nosters should be said by\neach in praying for his predecessor, pope Alexander.\n\nPope John then went to dinner, as it was now about twelve o\u2019clock, and\nthis ceremony had commenced between five and six in the morning.\n\nIn honour of him, feasts were continued at Bologna for the space\nof eight days; and on each of them very handsome processions were\nmade round St Peter\u2019s church, when the prelates were all dressed\nin vermilion robes, with copes of the same. In like manner did the\nCarthusians of St Michael\u2019s Mount, without the walls of Bologna.\n\nThe next day, the 25th of May, pope John held a consistory, in the\npresence of the cardinals, patriarchs, archbishops, bishops, and\npresented to the marquis of Ferrara and the italian heralds, many and\nvarious rich gifts. This was followed by a great feast, with dancing\nand music. The ensuing day, the pope revoked all that his predecessor\nhad done, excepting what he had confirmed, or what had been taken\ncorporal or spiritual possession of.\n\nKing Louis of Sicily arrived at Bologna the Friday after the coronation\nof the pope, and twenty-two cardinals, two patriarchs, six archbishops,\ntwenty bishops and eighteen abbots, handsomely equipped, went out of\nthe city to meet him: on his entrance, he went directly to the pope. He\nwas clothed in scarlet, and his horse\u2019s furniture was ornamented with\nsmall gilt bells: he was attended by about fifty knights dressed in his\nuniform. It was the last day of May that the king arrived,--and he was\nmost graciously received by the pope.\n\nThe ensuing day, the Florentines came to pay their duty and reverence\nto the holy father. They were about three hundred horse, among whom\nwere eighteen knights dressed in scarlet, with feathers bespangled\nwith gold. They were attended by six trumpets, two heralds, and ten\nmusicians playing on different instruments. When they had made their\nreverence to the pope, they returned to their h\u00f4tels, and the next\nday went to court. By reason of their alliance with king Louis, they\nsupplicated the pope to give him assistance against his adversary king\nLadislaus, adding, that they intended affording him every aid in their\npower of men and money. These Florentines were very indignant at the\nlate conduct of the Genoese in regard to the king of Sicily; for when\nthe king of Sicily was sailing with five gallies from Marseilles,\nnear to the port of Genoa, the Genoese, being in the interest of king\nLadislaus, hastily armed fifteen gallies with cross-bows and men at\narms, and sent them to attack the remainder of king Louis\u2019s fleet that\nwas following him, which they conquered, all but one, that escaped\nback to Marseilles by superior sailing, and carried the crews and all\ntheir baggage prisoners to Genoa.\n\nThe pope, having heard their request, asked some time to consider of\nit before he gave an answer. He could not well consent to it, because\nthe Genoese had been long connected with him, and he had also entered\ninto some engagements with king Ladislaus. The matter was, therefore,\ndeferred. King Louis was, notwithstanding this, magnificently feasted\nby the pope and cardinals; after which, he left his court well pleased,\nand returned to Provence.\n\nOn the first day of June, the pope held an open court, and signed many\ngraces and benefices, and all such things as with honour and justice he\ncould sign. He continued from that time to hold public audiences, and\nto do whatever business appertained to the papacy.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XIX.\n\n    THE GRAND MASTER OF PRUSSIA MARCHES A POWERFUL ARMY OF\n    CHRISTIANS INTO LITHUANIA.\n\n\nThis year, 1410, the grand master of the Teutonic order, accompanied\nby his brother knights and a numerous army of three hundred thousand\nChristians, invaded the kingdom of Lithuania, to destroy the whole of\nit. The king of Lithuania was soon ready to meet him; and, aided by\nthe king of Sarmatia, he assembled an army of four hundred thousand\ninfidels, and offered battle.\n\nThe Christians gained a complete victory,--for there remained dead on\nthe field full thirty-six thousand infidels, the principals of whom\nwere the grand general of Lithuania and the constable of Sarmatia. The\nremnant, with the other officers, escaped by flight. Of the Christians,\nonly two hundred were slain, but a great many were wounded.\n\nShortly after, the king of Poland, who was a determined enemy to\nthe grand master of Prussia, (and who had but faintly accepted of\nChristianity in order to obtain his kingdom) marched his Polanders to\nthe assistance of the infidels, whom he strongly pressed to renew the\nwar against Prussia, insomuch that, eight days after this defeat, the\nking of Poland, in conjunction with the aforesaid two kings, assembled\nan army of six hundred thousand men, and marched against the grand\nmaster of Prussia, and other Christian lords. A battle ensued, which\nwas lost by the Christians, who had more than sixty thousand killed\nand wounded. In the number of dead were the grand master of Prussia,\nwith a noble knight from Normandy, called sir John de Ferriere, son to\nthe lord de Ferriere, and another from Picardy, son to the lord du Bos\nd\u2019Ancquin.\n\nIt was currently reported that the day had been lost through the fault\nof the constable of Hungary, who commanded the second squadron of the\nChristians, by running away with all his Hungarians. The infidels,\nhowever, did not gain the glory without loss,--for without counting\nthe Polanders, who had ten thousand men slain, they lost upward of\nsix-score thousand men, according to the reports of the heralds, and\nthe bastard of Scotland, called the count de Hembe[60].\n\nThe lord de Kyeuraing and John de Grez, Hainaulters, were there, and\nwith them full twenty-four gentlemen, their countrymen, who were unhurt\nat this battle, and returned home as speedily as they could.\n\nAfter the engagement, the infidels entered Prussia, and despoiled\nmany parts of it, and took twelve inclosed towns in a short time and\ndestroyed them. They would have persevered in their wickedness, and\nhave done further mischief, had not a valiant knight of the Teutonic\norder, named Charles de Mouroufle[61], rallied a great number of the\nChristians who had fled, and by his prudence and vigour regained the\ngreater part of these towns, and finally driven the infidels out of the\ncountry[62].\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XX.\n\n    THE DUKE OF BERRY QUITS PARIS, AND RETIRES TO HIS OWN\n    ESTATES.--HE GOES AFTERWARD TO ANGERS, AND UNITES WITH THE DUKE\n    OF ORLEANS AND THE OTHER PRINCES OF HIS PARTY.\n\n\nThe duke of Berry, finding that he had not that government of the\nking and the duke of Acquitaine to which he had been accustomed,\nbecame very discontented, and retired to his estates, indignant at\nthe ministers, and particularly at his nephew and godson, the duke\nof Burgundy. Shortly after, he went to Angers, where the dukes of\nOrleans and of Bourbon, and all the principal lords of that party, were\nassembled.\n\nThey went in a body to the cathedral church, and there made oath, in\nthe most solemn manner, to support each other, and mutually to defend\ntheir honour against all who should attempt any thing against it,\nexcepting the king, and ever to remain in strict friendship united,\nwithout acting to the contrary in any kind of measure.\n\nMany great lords in France were not pleased with this confederation;\nand when, shortly after, news of it was brought to the king and his\ncouncil, he was much astonished and dissatisfied therewith.\n\nThe king, in consequence of the advice of the duke of Burgundy and his\nfriends, marched out of Paris, accompanied by him, the duke of Brabant,\nthe count de Montagu, and a large body of chivalry, and went to Senlis:\nthence to the town of Creil, to regain the castle of that place, which\nthe duke of Bourbon held, and had given the government of it to some of\nhis people.\n\nThe governor made so many delays before he surrendered it that the\nking became much displeased; and because they had not obeyed his\nfirst summons, the garrison were made prisoners, and carried bound\nto the prisons of the Ch\u00e2telet in Paris. The countess of Clermont,\ncousin-german to the king, soon after made application for their\ndeliverance, and obtained it; and on the morrow the king appointed\nanother garrison, and returned to Paris.\n\nThis expedition was not very agreeable to the Orleans-faction,--and\nthey continued to collect daily, and inlist in their party as many as\nthey could.\n\nThe duke of Burgundy became very uneasy at their proceedings; for he\nsuspected the duke of Orleans and his party would infringe the peace\nwhich had so lately been patched up between them at Chartres, or that\nthey would march a large force to Paris, to seize the government,\ntogether with the persons of the king and duke of Acquitaine.\n\nTo obviate this, he caused several royal summons to be proclaimed in\nvarious parts of the realm, for the assembling of men at arms and\nquartering them in the villages round Paris, to be ready to defend the\nking and his government against the ill-intentioned. By the advice of\nhis brothers and the king of Navarre, he resolved to defend himself\nby force against his adversaries, and caused it to be proclaimed\nthroughout the kingdom, in the king\u2019s name, that no one should dare to\nassemble armed in company of the dukes of Berry and Orleans, and their\nallies, under pain of corporal punishment and confiscation of goods.\n\nThe Orleans-faction, however, continued their meetings in spite of\nthis proclamation, and even forced their vassals to serve under and\naccompany them: I mean, such of them as were dilatory in obeying their\nsummons. There were, therefore, at this time, great and frequent\nassemblies of armed men in different parts of France, to the prejudice\nof the poor people.\n\nThose lords that were well inclined to the king came to Paris, and\ntheir men were quartered in the flat country of the island of France.\nThe Orleans-party fixed their quarters at Chartres and the adjacent\nparts; and their forces might amount, according to the estimate of\nwell-informed persons, to full six thousand men in armour, four\nthousand cross-bows, and sixteen hundred archers, without counting the\nunarmed infantry, of which there were great numbers.\n\nIn regard to the army which the duke of Burgundy had assembled by\norders from the king, it was estimated to consist of upward of sixteen\nthousand combatants, all men of tried courage. During this time, the\nking of Navarre and his brother, the count de Mortain, at the request\nof the duke of Burgundy, negotiated a peace between the duke of\nBrittany, their nephew, and the count de Penthievre, son-in-law to the\nduke of Burgundy.\n\nThis was done in the hope that the duke of Brittany would be induced\nto assist the king with his Bretons, and give up the Orleans-party, to\nwhom he had engaged himself. On the conclusion of this peace between\nthe two parties, twenty thousand golden crowns were sent the duke, to\ndefray the expenses he had been at in raising men at arms.\n\nLarge sums of money were also sent to the lord d\u2019Albreth, constable\nof France, that he might collect a numerous body of men at arms, and\nmarch them to Paris, to serve the king. He had not any great desire to\nperform this, for he was wholly inclined to the duke of Orleans and his\nallies, as was perfectly notorious shortly afterward.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XXI.\n\n    THE DEATH OF THE DUKE OF BOURBON.--THE PROCLAMATION OF THE KING\n    OF FRANCE.--THE DUKE OF ORLEANS AND HIS ALLIES SEND LETTERS TO\n    THE PRINCIPAL TOWNS IN FRANCE.\n\n\nDuring this troublesome time, Louis duke of Bourbon, uncle to the\nking of France by the mother\u2019s side, being full sixty years of age,\nfeeling himself oppressed with years and sickness, caused himself to be\nconveyed to his residence at Moulins[63] in the Bourbonnois, where he\ndeparted this life, and was buried in the church of the canons, which\nhe had founded.\n\nHe was succeeded by his only son, the count de Clermont, who, after\nsome days of lamentation, had the funeral obsequies of his father\nperformed, and, having arranged his affairs, returned to the duke of\nOrleans and the other lords at Chartres, and firmly united himself with\nthem, treading in the steps of his late father. The duke of Bourbon\nhad long held the office of great chamberlain of France, from the\nfriendship of the king, and was in possession of it even at the time of\nhis death; but at the entreaty of the king of Navarre and the duke of\nBurgundy, the king now gave it to the count de Nevers, to exercise the\nduties of it in the usual manner.\n\nAt this time, the duchess of Brittany, daughter to the king of France,\nwas brought to bed of a son; and she sent to request the duke of\nAcquitaine, her brother, to stand godfather. He sent, as his proxy,\nsir David de Brimeu, knight, lord of Humbercourt, with a handsome\npresent of jewels, which sir David gave her on the part of the duke of\nAcquitaine.\n\nThe king again issued his summons to the different bailiwicks and\nseneschalships in the realm, for all persons to arm without delay who\nwere bounden so to do from the tenure of their fiefs or arriere fiefs,\nand to march instantly to Paris to serve the king against the dukes of\nOrleans, Berry, Bourbon, the counts d\u2019Armagnac, d\u2019Alen\u00e7on, and others\ntheir allies, who, notwithstanding the king\u2019s positive orders to the\ncontrary, continued daily to assemble large bodies of men at arms, to\nthe destruction of his country and subjects.\n\nThe above dukes wrote letters to the king, to the university of Paris,\nand to many of the principal towns, to explain the causes why they had\nthus confederated and collected men at arms; one of which, signed with\ntheir signs-manuel, they sent to the town of Amiens, and the contents\nwere as follows:\n\n\u2018To our well-beloved and very dear citizens, burgesses, and inhabitants\nof the town of Amiens, health and affection. We have written to\nour most redoubted and sovereign lord the king of France in manner\nfollowing:--We dukes of Berry, of Orleans, and of Bourbon, counts of\nAlen\u00e7on and of Armagnac, your humble uncles, relations and subjects,\nfor ourselves and all others our adherents, wellwishers to your\nperson,--as the rights of your domination, your crown and royal\nmajesty, have been so nobly instituted, and founded on justice,\npower, and the true obedience of your subjects,--and as your glory\nand authority are resplendent through all parts of the world, you\nhaving been worthily consecrated and anointed by the holy roman see,\nand considered by all Christendom as sovereign monarch and equal\ndistributor of justice, as well to the poor as to the rich, without\nowing obedience to any other lord, but God and his Divine Majesty, who\nhas been pleased most worthily to have gifted you,--may all those who\nare connected with you by blood, by their frank and loyal affections,\nguard and defend your sacred person as your relations and subjects.\n\n\u2018And may we, in particular, as your near relations, and for that cause\nmore obliged to it, set an example of due obedience to your other\nsubjects, and exert ourselves in preserving to you free liberty of\naction in every part of your government, insomuch that you may have\npower to reward the good and punish the wicked, and to preserve every\none in his just rights, and likewise that you may execute justice in\nsuch wise that your kingdom may remain in peace, first to the honour\nof God, and then to your own honour, and to the example of your good\nfriends and subjects, by following the paths of your predecessors,\nthe kings of France, who, by this noble way of governing their great\nkingdom, have ever preserved tranquillity and peace, insomuch that all\nChristian nations, far and near, and even infidels, have had recourse\nto them in their disputes, and have been perfectly contented with their\ndecisions on the cases referred to them, as the fountains of justice\nand loyalty.\n\n\u2018And, most sovereign lord, that your power, justice, and the state of\nyour government may not suffer at present any wound or diminution,\nand that public affairs may be managed according to the principles\nof reason, in such wise as may be apparent to all men of sound\nunderstanding;--\n\n\u2018For this effect, most redoubted sovereign, we, the above-written, have\nconfederated and assembled, that we may most humbly lay before you the\nreal state of your situation, in regard to your royal person, and also\nthat of my lord of Acquitaine, your eldest son. We have likewise to lay\nbefore you the manner in which you are enthralled, and the government\ncarried on, that justice may be restored, and the public weal no longer\nsuffer, as we can more fully explain. Should any persons deny this,\nlet your majesty, by the advice of your council, appoint some of the\nprinces of your blood, and other impartial and unprejudiced persons,\nto inquire into it, in whatever number you in your wisdom may select.\nBut we advise that you speedily and effectually provide for the safety\nof your own person, and for that of my lord of Acquitaine, your eldest\nson, so that your state may enjoy justice and a good government, to the\nadvancement of the public welfare, and that the power and authority\nmay be exercised by you alone, freely and uncontrolled by any other\nperson whatever; and that such a desirable object may be obtained, we,\nthe above-named, offer our earnest prayers, and, at the same time, our\nlives and fortunes, whatever they may be, which God has graciously\ngranted us in this world, for the just defence of your rights, and in\nopposing all who may attempt to infringe on them, if any such there be.\n\n\u2018Most redoubted lord, we also inform you, that we shall not break up\nour confederation until you shall have listened to us, and until we\nshall see that you have properly provided against the inconveniences\nwe have mentioned, and until you be fully and wholly reinstated in\nthat power which is your right. To this, most redoubted lord, are we\nbound, as well in regard to what we have already said, as from fear,\nhonour and reverence to our Creator, from whom originates your royal\nauthority, and also to satisfy justice, and then yourself, who are\nsovereign king on earth, and our sole lord. To your support we are\nurged by our kindred and by our love to your person; for in truth,\nmost redoubted sovereign, there is nothing we dread so much as having\noffended God, yourself, and wounded our own honour, by leaving for so\nlong time unnoticed the aforesaid grievances, which are notorious to\nevery one.\n\n\u2018In like manner as we signify the above to you, we shall do the same to\nall prelates, lords, universities, cities and principal towns of your\nrealm, and in general to all your wellwishers.\n\n\u2018Most redoubted lord, we humbly supplicate that you will deign to hear\nus, and consider of what we have written,--for the sole object we aim\nat personally affects yourself and your government; and we earnestly\nbeg that you will speedily adopt the most effectual measures for the\nenjoyment of your own freedom of action, and that your government may\nbe carried on to the praise of God first, and your own glory, and\nto the advantage of all your good subjects who are anxious for your\nwelfare.\n\n\u2018We have written this, that you may know our intentions, and the cause\nof our assembling, which is solely for the preservation of the personal\nliberty of our lord and king, and the affranchisement of his government\nfrom any hands but his own. For this object we have sought the advice\nof the most prudent men, and shall follow their counsels, with all the\nmeans God has put in our power, to obtain so desirable an end, for the\ngeneral welfare of the realm; and we intend so to act toward our lord\nthe king that God and the world shall be satisfied with us.\n\n\u2018And we most earnestly entreat that for so praiseworthy an object\nyou will join us, and exert yourselves in the same cause; for it is\nnot properly us but the king your lord that you will serve, whom by\nyour oaths you are bounden to assist,--and know that for so doing you\nwill be commended by all men of understanding and prudence. Given at\nChartres the 2d day of December, 1410.\u2019\n\nThis letter, when received by the council of the town of Amiens,\nproduced very little sensation,--for all, or the greater part of the\ninhabitants, were inclined to the duke of Burgundy. When a similar one\nwas read in the council of state, it did not make any impression on the\nking, nor did it seem advisable that the dukes should have an audience;\nbut, on the contrary, orders were sent to them to disband their forces\nwithout delay, on pain of incurring the royal indignation.----They\nrefused to obey this order, and bade the messenger tell the king,\nthat they would not cease assembling until he should grant them an\naudience, and hear their complaints. At this period, the dukes of\nAcquitaine and Burgundy paid a visit to the queen of France at her\nresidence in the castle of Melun, and left there a garrison, having\nbrought back with them the queen and her children to the castle of\nVincennes.\n\nThe duke of Brabant at this time left Paris, to go to his country, and\nassemble his Brabanters to serve the king. Many able ambassadors were\nsent, in the king\u2019s name, to the lords assembled at Chartres; and among\nthem was the grand master of Rhodes, to signify to them that they must\ndisband their army, and that, if they pleased to wait on the king in\ntheir private capacity, he would see them.\n\nThis they refused; and as they continued disobedient, the king took\npossession of the counties of Boulogne[64], Estampes, Valois,\nBeaumont, Clermont, and other lands belonging to the said dukes,\ncounts, and their adherents, of whatever rank they might be. The king\u2019s\nofficers appointed governors to the castles and fortresses within these\ncountries, whom they ordered to govern them at the expense of the\naforesaid lords.\n\nSo very numerous were the forces that assembled near Paris, in\nobedience to the summons from the king and the duke of Burgundy, that\nthe oldest persons had not for a long time seen so many men at arms\ntogether.\n\nAmong the number was the duke of Brabant, with a great force. He was\nquartered in the town of St Denis, where he lived at the expense of the\ngreater part of the inhabitants, as if he had been in the open country.\nThe count de Penthievre, son-in-law to the duke of Burgundy, was there\nwith him, accompanied by a large body of Bretons.\n\nTwo thousand men belonging to the count Waleran de St Pol were\nquartered at Menil-Aubry, and the adjacent villages.--Because the\ncount himself resided in Paris, he one day ordered his troops to be\nassembled under the lord de Chin, for him to march them to Paris to be\nmustered and enrolled for pay; but it happened, as they were marching\nthrough St Denis to obey the order, that a dispute arose between them\nand the Brabanters, on account of some enterprise which the last had\nmade against the lord de Carlian, a native of the Boulonois, so that\nthe two parties armed and drew up in battle-array to decide matters\nby combat. The duke of Brabant was soon informed of this tumult, and\nhastened from Paris to check his own men, and acted so prudently with\nboth parties that an end was put to it; but he was very wroth with the\nfirst promoters of it, for he was married to the daughter and heiress\nof the count de St Pol.\n\nWhen they had marched through Saint Denis, they came before their lord,\nthe count de St Pol, in Paris, who having reviewed them, and paid many\ncompliments to their captains, dismissed them to the quarters whence\nthey had come. In order to pay these troops which had been levied,\nas has been said, by orders from the king and the duke of Burgundy,\nand which amounted, by the muster-rolls, to fifteen thousand men with\nhelmets, seventeen thousand cross-bows and archers, very heavy taxes\nwere levied throughout the realm, and particularly on the city of\nParis. It will be impossible to relate one half of the mischiefs the\narmies of both parties committed: suffice it to say, that churches,\nchurchmen, and the poor people were very great sufferers.\n\nThe Orleans-party, shortly after this, marched from Chartres\nto Montlehery, seven leagues from Paris, and there, and in the\nneighbouring villages, quartered their army, ruining the whole country\non their line of march. The lords and adherents of this faction, as\nwell clergy as seculars, wore, as their badge, a narrow band of white\nlinen on their shoulders, hanging over their left arm, like to a deacon\nwhen celebrating divine service.\n\nWhen the king of France and his council learnt that they had approached\nso near the capital, they hastily dispatched to the leaders the count\nde la Marche, the archbishop of Rheims, the bishop of Beauvais, and the\ngrand master of Rhodes, with some others, to persuade them to disband\ntheir army, and come before him at Paris, in consequence of his former\norders, without arms, in the manner in which vassals should wait on\ntheir lords, and that he would do them justice in regard to their\ndemands; but that, should they refuse, he would instantly march his\nforces against them.--The princes made answer, that they would not\nact otherwise than they had said in their letter to the king; and the\nambassadors, seeing they could not gain any thing, returned to Paris.\n\nIn like manner, the university sent to them an embassy of learned\nmen, headed by Noe\u00e9tz, abbot of Povegny and doctor in divinity, who\nharangued them very ably and gravely. They were very handsomely\nreceived by the princes, especially by the duke of Berry, who, among\nother grievances, complained much that his nephew, the king, should be\ncounselled by such fellows as the provost of Paris, and others of the\nsame sort, who now ruled the realm, which was most miserably governed,\nas he was ready to explain, article by article, when they should be\nadmitted to an audience.\n\nThey could obtain no other reply than that, with God\u2019s pleasure, they\nwould accomplish, to the utmost of their power, the matters contained\nin their circular letters to the university and principal towns.\n\nOn this repeated ill success, the king, by the advice of his council,\nsent another embassy, composed of the queen, the cardinal de Bar, the\ncount de St Pol, and others. The count de St Pol had lately accepted,\nwith the king\u2019s approbation, the office of grand butler of France,\nwhich the provost of Paris had held, through the interest of the count\nde Tancarville, by a gift from the king.\n\nNotwithstanding the queen and her companions were received with every\nhonour, she did not remain with their army, but went to the castle\nof Marcoussi, which is not far distant from Montlehery, with her\nattendants, and remained there some time negotiating with them, and\nsome of the princes daily visited her. Although she acted with much\nperseverance, she failed in her object,--for the princes were firm in\ntheir resolution of marching with their army to the king, and requiring\nthat he would execute justice and attend to the affairs of government,\nand choose another set of ministers than those now in power.\n\nFinding she was labouring in vain, she returned with her companions\nto Paris, and related to the king all that had passed. He was very\nindignant, and much troubled thereat; and on the morrow, the 23d\nSeptember, he ordered all the men at arms that were come to serve him\nto be drawn out, and the baggage and artillery waggons to be made ready\ninstantly to march against the Orleans-party, to give them battle.\n\nWhen all were ready, and as he was going to attend mass and afterward\nto mount his horse, he was met by the rector of the university,\nmagnificently accompanied by all the members and supporters of it, who\nremonstrated with him, that his daughter, the university of Paris, was\npreparing to leave that city, from the great want of provisions, which\nthe men at arms of the two parties prevented coming to Paris,--for no\none could venture on the high roads without being robbed and insulted;\nand, likewise, that all the low countries round Paris were despoiled by\nthese men at arms. They most humbly requested, that he would provide\na remedy, and give them such answer as might seem to him good. The\nchancellor, namely, master Arnauld de Corbie, instantly replied, \u2018The\nking will assemble his council after dinner, and you shall have an\nanswer.\u2019 The king of Navarre, being present, entreated the king that he\nwould fix an hour for hearing them again after dinner; and the king,\ncomplying with his request, appointed an hour for the rector to return.\n\nWhen the king had dined, he entered the _chambre verde_, attended by\nthe following princes: the dukes of Acquitaine, Burgundy and Brabant,\nthe marquis du Pont, the duke of Lorraine, the counts de Mortain,\nde Nevers and de Vaudemont, with many other great lords, as well\necclesiastical as secular. The king of Navarre made four requests to\nthe king: first, that all the princes of the blood, as well on the one\nside as on the other, should retire to their principalities, and never\nmore interfere in the king\u2019s government, and likewise that henceforth\nthey should not receive any profits or pensions, as well from the\nsubsidies arising from their lands as from other exactions, but live\non their own proper revenues until the public treasury should be in\na better state than it was at that moment: however, should the king\nbe inclined to make them presents of any thing, or call them near his\nperson, they should be alway ready to obey him.\n\nHis second request was, that some diminution should take place in those\ntaxes that most aggrieved the people.\n\nThe third, that as some of the citizens of Paris had lent different\nsums of money to the king, of which repayment had been promised, but\nnot made, sufficient assignments on the treasury should be given to\nthem.\n\nThe fourth, that the affairs of the king and realm should be governed\nby prudent men, taken from the three estates of the kingdom. When the\nking of Navarre had ended, the king himself replied, and said he would\ntake advice on what he had proposed, and then give him such answers as\nought to satisfy him and every one else.\n\nWhen this was over, the king showed the same determination as before\nto march, on the morrow morning, against the rebellious lords; but he\nwas overruled, and the queen, with the former ambassadors, were again\nsent to negotiate a peace. On their arrival at the army of the princes,\nshe exerted herself, as it was said very much and loyally; for it was\ncommonly reported that she was in her heart inclined to the Orleans\nfaction.\n\nDuring the time of this embassy, the count Am\u00e9 de Savoye, who had been\nsent for by the king, arrived at Paris with five hundred men at arms.\nHis brothers-in-law the dukes of Burgundy and Brabant, and the count\nde Nevers, attended by many other lords, went out to meet him beyond\nthe gate of St Anthony, and thence conducted him to the palace to the\nking, who very kindly received him.\n\nSome days after, the queen, not having more success than before,\nreturned to the king, and told him that she could not any way bring\nthem to terms, for they were obstinate in their original intentions.\nShe then hastened to the castle of Vincennes as speedily as she could.\n\nOn the ensuing morning, the aforesaid lords quitted Montlehery; and\nthe duke of Berry came to his h\u00f4tel of Vinchestre[65], which he had\nrebuilt, and was there lodged. The duke of Orleans fixed his quarters\nat Gentilly, in the palace of the bishop, and the count d\u2019Armagnac at\nVitry; the rest as near to each other as they could; and at vespers,\nthey had advanced as far as the suburbs of St Marcel and the gate de\nBordelles.\n\nThe king, the duke of Burgundy, and the other princes, were greatly\nsurprised at this boldness; and the Parisians, at their own expense,\ncollected a body of a thousand men armed with helmets to serve as a\nguard during the night, and they also made great fires in very many of\nthe streets. To prevent them from crossing the Seine at Charenton, they\nsent two hundred men at arms to defend that pass.\n\nThe third day, Arthur count de Richemont, brother to the duke of\nBrittany, joined the dukes of Berry and Orleans, with six thousand\nbreton horse, to the great displeasure of the king, and especially of\nthe duke of Burgundy; for the duke of Brittany had lately been summoned\nby the king to attend him with his Bretons, and had, for this purpose,\nreceived a very large sum of money. The duke, in consequence, having\nother business in hand, sent his brother to serve the king in his room.\n\nIt was also said, that the lord d\u2019Albreth, constable of France, had\ndisposed of the money sent him in the same manner, and had employed it\nin the service of the duke of Berry. The army of the princes marched to\nSaint Cloud, and to the adjoining towns, which they plundered, taking\nby force whatever they were in need of. Some of the worst of them\nravished and robbed many women, who fled to Paris, and made clamorous\noutcries against their ravishers, requiring vengeance from the king,\nand restitution, were it possible, of what they had been plundered of.\n\nThe king, moved with pity, and by the importunity of his ministers,\nordered a decree to be drawn out, which condemned the whole of the\nOrleans-party to death and confiscation of goods. While this was doing,\nthe duke of Berry, uncle to the king, hastily sent ambassadors to\nParis to prevent it from taking effect, and in the name of their lord\nrequested that the decree might be a little delayed, when other means\nof accommodation, through God\u2019s grace, would be found.\n\nThis request was granted, and the proclamation of the decree put off:\na negotiation was entered into warmly by both parties, although the\nking was very much displeased that the princes of his blood were thus\nquarrelling with each other, so that he should be forced to proceed\nwith rigour against them. To prevent the effusion of blood, the king\ndesired his chancellor and others of his privy council to exert\nthemselves diligently that peace might be established; and he likewise\nspoke to the same purpose to the duke of Burgundy, the count de St\nPol, and other princes, who promised faithfully that an accommodation\nshould take place.\n\nWhile these matters were going on, the lord de Dampierre, the bishop\nof Noyon, the lord de Tignonville, master Gautier de Col, and others,\nambassadors from the king of France, were sent from Paris to Boulogne,\nto meet an embassy from the king of England, consisting of the lord\nBeaumont, the bishop of St David\u2019s, and others, who had arrived at\nCalais to treat of a truce. It was prolonged from All-saints-day, when\nthe former one expired, to the feast of Easter ensuing.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XXII.\n\n    IN CONSEQUENCE OF THE NEGOTIATIONS BETWEEN THE TWO PARTIES OF\n    BURGUNDY AND OF ORLEANS, PEACE IS MADE BETWEEN THEM, AND CALLED\n    \u2018THE PEACE OF WINCHESTER,\u2019 WHICH WAS THE SECOND PEACE.\n\n\nAfter the ambassadors from both parties, namely those of the king and\nduke of Burgundy on the one hand, and those of the dukes of Berry, of\nOrleans, and of Bourbon, on the other, had held several conferences,\nthe following treaty was at length concluded, on the 2d of November.\n\nThe princes of the blood on each side, with the exception of the count\nde Mortain, were to retire to their principalities, and lead back their\nforces, committing as little damage as possible to the countries they\nshould pass through, without fraud or deception. The duke of Berry had\nliberty, if he pleased, to reside at Giens-sur-Loire, and the count\nd\u2019Armagnac might stay there with him for fifteen days. The king of\nNavarre was to depart for his duchy of Nemours. The duke of Brabant\nmight, if he so pleased, visit his sister, the duchess of Burgundy, in\nthat country.\n\nThe aforesaid princes were to conduct their men at arms so that all\ntrespassing might be mutually avoided on each other\u2019s lands,--nor\nshould they suffer any of their adherents to commit waste or damage, so\nthat all inconvenience or source of quarrel might be avoided.\n\nItem, in whatever garrisons there shall be more men than are usually\nkept, the same shall be reduced to the accustomed number of men\nretained therein for its defence, without any fraud or deception. And\nthat these terms may be faithfully observed, the aforesaid lords shall\npromise, on their oaths, made before such princes as the king may\nnominate, that they will punctually and loyally keep every article.\n\nItem, the captains of their troops shall make oath also to the due\nobservance of this treaty; and if it be the good pleasure of the king\nhe may appoint some of his knights as conductors to the men at arms,\nand superintendents on their leaders, to prevent them and their men\nfrom delaying their march, and also from committing waste in the\ncountries through which they shall pass.\n\nItem, the aforesaid lords will not return near the person of the king,\nunless they be sent for by him, by letters patent under the great seal,\nconfirmed by his council, or on urgent business,--nor shall any of the\naforesaid lords intrigue to obtain orders for their return; and this\nthey shall especially swear to before commissioners nominated for the\npurpose. The king shall make the terms of this treaty public, and all\nthe articles they shall swear to observe.\n\nShould the king think it necessary to send for the duke of Berry,\nhe shall, at the same time, summon the duke of Burgundy, and _vice\nversa_; and this he will observe, in order that they may both meet at\nthe same time on the appointed day, which will hold good until the\nensuing Easter in the year 1411; and from that day until the following\nEaster in 1412, no one of the aforesaid shall proceed against another\nby acts of violence or by words.--Every article of this treaty to be\nproperly drawn out and signed by the king and his council, with certain\npenalties to be incurred on the infringement of any of them.\n\nItem, the king shall select certain able and discreet persons, of\nunblemished characters, and no way pensioners, but such as have solely\ngiven their oaths of allegiance to the king, to form the royal council;\nand when such persons have been chosen, a list of their names shall be\nshown to the princes on each side.\n\nItem, the dukes of Berry and Burgundy, having the wardship of the duke\nof Acquitaine, shall agree together as to the person who shall be their\nsubstitute in that office during their absence; and powers for so doing\nshall be sent to the duke of Berry, as he is at present without them.\n\nItem, the provost of Paris shall be dismissed from all offices which he\nholds under the king, and another shall be appointed according to the\nking\u2019s pleasure, and as he may judge expedient.\n\nItem, it was ordained, that no knight, or his heirs, should in future\nsuffer any molestation because he had not obeyed the summons sent him\nby either of the parties; and should they be any way molested, the king\nwould punish the offender by confiscation of his property. Letters,\nconfirming this last article, shall be given by the king and the\naforesaid lords to whoever may require them.\n\nThis treaty was concluded on All-saints day, and on the ensuing Monday\nconfirmed; and four days after, the greater part of the articles were\nfulfilled. Sir John de Neele, chancellor to the duke of Acquitaine,\nwas, by the king\u2019s command, appointed to receive the oaths of the lords\non each side.\n\nThe king dismissed his provost of Paris, sir Peter des Essars, knight,\nfrom all his offices, and nominated sir Brunelet de Sainct-Cler, one of\nhis masters of the household, to the provostship. He also sent letters,\nsealed with his great seal, to the duke of Berry, appointing him to\nthe guardianship of his son, the duke of Acquitaine.\n\nIn consequence of one of the articles above recited, twelve knights,\nfour bishops, and four lords of the parliament, were appointed to\ngovern the kingdom,--namely, the archbishop of Rheims, the bishops\nof Noyon and Saint Flour, master John de Torcy, lately one of the\nparliament, but now bishop of Tournay, the grand master of the king\u2019s\nhousehold sir Guichart Daulphin, the grand master of Rhodes, the\nlords de Montenay, de Toursy, de Rambures, d\u2019Offemont, de Rouvroy, de\nRumacourt, Saquet de Toursy, le vidame d\u2019Amiens, sir John de Toursy,\nknight to the duke of Berry, and grand master of his household, and the\nlord de St George. The two last were nominated, by the dukes of Berry\nand Burgundy, guardians to the duke of Acquitaine during their absence.\n\nThe two parties now left Paris and the adjoining fortresses and\ncastles; but on the following Saturday, the king was again strongly\nseized with his usual malady, and confined in his h\u00f4tel of St Pol. The\nqueen and her attendants, then at Vincennes, returned to Paris with her\nson, the duke of Acquitaine, and fixed their residence, with her lord,\nin the h\u00f4tel de St Pol.\n\nThe duke of Burgundy went to Meaux, where he was met by the king of\nNavarre;--and thence the duke went to Arras and Flanders, accompanied\nby sir Peter des Essars, late provost of Paris, and his most\nconfidential adviser; and he always gave him the title of provost of\nParis, as though he had still retained the office.\n\nConformably to the treaty, all the men at arms on each side returned\nto the places whence they had come, but plundering the poor people\non their march. A number of Lombards and Gascons had formed part of\nthe army of the duke of Orleans, who were mounted on terrible horses,\nthat were taught to wheel round when on full gallop, which seemed very\nastonishing to the French, Flemings, Picards, and Brabanters, who had\nnot been accustomed to such movements.\n\nBecause the count d\u2019Armagnac had joined the duke of Orleans with a\nlarge body, his men were called _Armagnacs_; and in consequence, the\nwhole of that faction were called _Armagnacs_. Although there were many\nprinces of much higher rank in either party than the count d\u2019Armagnac,\nthey were not pleased if they were not called by this name, which\nlasted a very considerable time.\n\nAs the treaty before mentioned had been concluded at the h\u00f4tel de\nWinchester, where the dukes of Berry and Orleans, with others of their\nparty were amusing themselves, it was called \u2018The Peace of Winchester.\u2019\n\nAll who had come to these meetings at Paris now departed, and those\nto whom the government had been intrusted remained near the person of\nthe king and the duke of Acquitaine. The people expected, that by this\nmeans they should enjoy more peaceable times; but it happened just the\ncontrary, as you shall shortly hear.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XXIII.\n\n    A MEETING OF THE UNIVERSITY AND CLERGY IS HELD ON THE XXIII. OF\n    NOVEMBER, IN THE CHURCH OF ST BERNARD AT PARIS, ON THE STATE OF\n    THE CHURCH.\n\n\nWhen peace had been established, a large congregation was held, by\norder of the university, on the 23d of November, in the church of\nthe Bernardins in Paris,--to which were called, the bishop of Puy\nin Auvergne, many other prelates, and in general all bachelors and\nlicentiates in canon and civil law, although in former times doctors\nonly had been summoned.\n\nThis assembly was holden at the request of the archbishop of Pisa,\nand other legates from the pope, on the subject of tythes, the vacant\nbenefices, and the effects of the dead. But it was opened by the\nadoption of a solemn ordinance, which had been ordained during the\npapacy of Pietro della Luna, respecting the liberties of the french\nchurch, in the year 1406, and since confirmed by the king, his great\ncouncil, and the parliament, namely, that the said church shall be\nmaintained in all its ancient privileges. It was thus freed from all\ntythes, procurations, and subsidies, or taxes whatever. And as the\nobject of these legates was to establish the above impositions, it was\nresolved that the aforesaid ordinance should be strictly conformed to;\nand the more effectually to have it observed, they sent deputations\nto the king, to his council, and to the parliament, to whom the guard\nof this ordinance belonged, to obviate the inconveniences that might\nfollow should any article of it be infringed.\n\nIt was also concluded, that should the legates attempt, by menaces of\necclesiastical censures or otherwise, to compel payment of any tribute,\nan appeal should be made from them to a general council of the church.\n\nItem, should any collectors or sub-collectors exact subsidies to\nthe church, they shall be arrested, and punished by confiscation of\nproperty, and, when they have no property, by imprisonment.\n\nIt was also concluded, that to settle this matter, the king\u2019s attorney,\nand other lords, should be requested to join the university. But it was\nat last resolved, that should the pope plead an evident want of means\nto support the church, a council should be called, and a charitable\nsubsidy granted, the which should be collected by certain discreet\npersons selected by the council, and the amount distributed according\nto the directions of the said council.\n\nOn the ensuing Monday was held a royal sessions, at which the duke of\nAcquitaine, the archbishop of Pisa, and the other legates from the\npope, the rector and the members of the university were present. In\nthis meeting, the archbishop declared, that what he demanded was due\nto the apostolic chamber, by every right, divine, canon, civil and\nnatural, and that it was sacred and simple justice,--adding, that\nwhoever should deny this right was scarcely a Christian.\n\nThe university was greatly displeased, and said, that such expressions\nwere derogatory to the king\u2019s honour, to that of the university, and\nconsequently of the whole kingdom. From what had passed, another\ngeneral assembly was holden on Sunday the 30th of November, in the\nplace where it had been held the preceding Sunday; and it was then\ndetermined that the university should send a deputation to the king,\nto lay before him the words uttered by the legates, and to demand that\nthey should be publicly recanted by them. It was proposed, that in case\nthey should refuse so to do, the faculty of theologians should bring\naccusations against them, on the articles of faith, and they should be\npunished according to the exigence of the case. It was also resolved,\nthat the university of Paris should write letters to all the other\nuniversities in the realm, and to the prelates and clergy, to invite\nthem to unite in their opposition to such tenets.\n\nMany other things were agitated in this meeting, which I pass over for\nthe sake of brevity. It was, however, finally concluded to send an\nanswer to the pope, that he could not have any subsidy granted him in\nthe way which had been proposed. The meeting came to the resolution,\nthat the university of Paris should require from the archbishop of\nRheims, and those of the members of the king\u2019s government who, as\nmembers, had given their oaths to the university, to join in the\nmeasures they had adopted, otherwise they should be expelled the\nuniversity.\n\nIt should be known, that while these things were passing, the legates,\nfearful of the consequences, hastily left Paris, without taking leave,\nas is usually done. The holy father, however, sent ambassadors to the\nking, to demand payment of the tenth imposed on the french church. When\nthey declared the object of their mission to the council of state, and\nin the presence of the duke of Acquitaine, they said, that not only\nwas the french church bound to pay this subsidy to the pope, but all\nother churches which were under his obedience,--first, from the divine\nlaw in Leviticus, which declares that all deacons shall pay to the\nhigh priest a tenth of their possessions,--and, 2dly, by natural and\npositive law.\n\nWhilst these things were passing, the university came to the council,\nand on the morrow a congregation was held in the monastery of the\nBernardins. It was then resolved that the manner of demanding this\nsubsidy should be reprobated, for that it was iniquitous, and contrary\nto the decree of the king and his council in the year 1406, for the\npreservation of the franchises of the french church. The university\ninsisted on this decree being preserved inviolate, and declared, that\nif the pope or his legates attempted to constrain any person to pay\nthis subsidy by censures of the church, it would appeal to a general\ncouncil on this subject. Should any of the new ministers attempt any\nthing against this decree, the university would appeal to the king and\nthe whole council of state; and should any members of the university\nurge the payment of this tenth, they should be expelled; and if any\npersons, guilty of the above offence, should have any property of their\nown, the university would require that the said property should be\nconfiscated to the king\u2019s use, otherwise they should be imprisoned.\n\nShould the holy father adopt the manner of raising this subsidy by\nway of charity, it would be agreeable to the university that the king\nshould call together the prelates of his realm,--first, to consider\nwhat subjects should be discussed in the general council of the church\nto be holden on this occasion; secondly, to deliberate on the demands\nmade by the ambassadors respecting the tenth. Should it be determined\nfor the pope to receive this subsidy, the university expressed its wish\nthat some sufficient person should be deputed from this kingdom to\nreceive the amount of the same, for the peace and union of the greek\nand latin churches, and from England for aid of the holy land, and the\npreaching the gospel to all the world; for such were the purposes for\nwhich the legates declared the holy father raised this subsidy. The\nuniversity solicited the members of the parliament to unite themselves\nwith them, for it was in support of their decree made on the demand of\nthe king\u2019s attorney-general.\n\nJuvenal des Ursins[66] was deputed by the university to reply to what\nthe pope\u2019s ambassadors had advanced before the council; but at length\nthe archbishop of Pisa, perceiving he could not otherwise gain his\nobject, humbled himself much before the university, and spoke privately\nto some of the principal members to prevail on them to assist him.\nHowever, on the 28th day of January, it was declared, that no subsidy\nwhatever should be granted to the pope without the previous consent of\nthe french church; and the deliberation on this matter was deferred to\nthe 10th of February, when many prelates were summoned to give their\nopinions thereon. Through the active diligence of the university, the\nlegates could not obtain consent that a subsidy in any shape should be\ngranted to the pope, although the greater part of the lords, and in\nparticular the princes, were very agreeable to it.\n\nWhile these matters were transacting at Paris, the holy father sent\nletters to the king of France and to the university, to say that\nthe Florentines refused any longer to obey him, from fear of king\nLadislaus; that this king Ladislaus was assembling an immense army,\nas the pope wrote word, to conquer Rome and the adjacent country,\nthat he might place in the chair of St Peter a pope according to his\npleasure. Should this happen, a more ruinous schism might befal the\nchurch than the former one,--to obviate which, he requested from the\nking, the princes, and university, aid and support. This was, through\nthe intercession of the archbishop of Pisa, complied with, and in the\nmanner that shall be hereafter related.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XXIV.\n\n    THE LORD DE CROY IS MADE PRISONER WHEN GOING ON AN EMBASSY\n    FROM THE DUKE OF BURGUNDY TO THE DUKE OF BERRY, TO THE GREAT\n    DISPLEASURE OF THE LATTER.\n\n\nThe duke of Burgundy, shortly after he had left Paris, sent three of\nhis counsellors, namely, the lords de Croy and de Dours, knights, and\nmaster Raoul, head canon of Tournay and of Amiens, licentiate of law,\nas ambassadors to the king at Paris, and to his uncle and godfather,\nthe duke of Berry, at Bourges. But when they were travelling between\nOrleans and Bourges, the lord de Croy was arrested by the officers\nof the duke of Orleans on the last day but one of January, without\nany molestation being given to the other two ambassadors or their\nattendants.\n\nHe was carried to a castle within three leagues of Blois, and, on the\nmorrow, strictly interrogated respecting the murder of the late duke\nof Orleans, and put to the torture to confess if he had been any way\nconsenting to it, or an accomplice in it; but they could not discover\nany thing to his prejudice. On the following Sunday, he was carried to\nBlois, and confined in the dungeons of a prison.\n\nThe other ambassadors continued their route to Bourges, where, having\nexplained to the duke of Berry the object of their mission, they humbly\nentreated that he would exert himself with the duke of Orleans that the\nlord de Croy might obtain his liberty. When they related to him the\nmanner of the lord de Croy being arrested, the duke was filled with\nindignation, and instantly sent letters signed with his hand to the\nduke of Orleans, to say that he must immediately give up his prisoner,\nwhom he had illegally arrested when coming to him; and that if he did\nnot do it, he would have him for his enemy.\n\nThe duke of Orleans, on the receipt of this letter, considered it well,\nand replied at length most courteously to the duke of Berry, excusing\nhimself for what he had done, but putting off the setting the lord de\nCroy at liberty. The king and the duke of Acquitaine were soon made\nacquainted with this arrest,--and they sent letters to the duke of\nOrleans, commanding him instantly to deliver the lord de Croy from his\nimprisonment, on pain of incurring their indignation.\n\nNotwithstanding these letters, the duke of Orleans would not give him\nhis liberty, but kept him in close confinement, where he was very often\nmost rigorously treated, and at times examined and put to the torture.\n\nIn the mean time, the other ambassadors sent messengers to the duke of\nBurgundy, to notify to him this conduct and the means they had taken in\nvain for the deliverance of the lord de Croy.\n\nThe duke was much surprised and vexed at this news, for he greatly\nloved the lord de Croy. Having considered this insult, and others that\nhad been offered to his friends, he thought it time to take effectual\nmeasures for his security, and in consequence amassed as large a sum as\nhe could: to this end, he sold his right to all confiscations within\nthe town of Ghent to the townsmen, and yielded for money several other\nprivileges to the Flemings. He likewise carried his son, the count\nde Charolois, to show him to many of the principal towns as their\nfuture lord, who, on this occasion, made him considerable presents. He\nafterward held a grand council on his affairs, in the town of Tournay,\nwhich was attended by his brothers-in-law duke William and the bishop\nof Liege. The count de Namur was also present, and several great lords\nfrom the borders of the empire. The duke of Burgundy solicited their\naid against his enemies, should need be, and in particular against\nthe duke of Orleans, his brothers and allies. This service they\noffered him liberally, to the utmost of their power. Having obtained\ntheir promises, he went to Lille, whither the marshal Boucicaut, late\ngovernor of Genoa, came to meet him. He received him very kindly, and\ncarried him with him to his town of Arras, whither he had convoked all\nthe lords and nobles of the county of Artois and its dependancies.\n\nWhen they were assembled in the great hall of his residence, he\naddressed them himself, and caused them to be harangued by master\nWilliam Bouvier, knight, licentiate of law, to explain how his enemies\nwere plotting daily to arrest and imprison his friends, and had\nactually arrested and imprisoned the lord de Croy; for which cause he\nhad now assembled them, to request that they would remain loyal, and\nthat, should there be a necessity, they would enter into his pay and\nserve him,--for they might be assured it would be solely in his own\ndefence, and for that of the king and the duke of Acquitaine, that\nhe would ever take up arms. He declared, that it was merely for the\npreservation of the crown to his present majesty, and to his heirs,\nthat he had slain the duke of Orleans, father to the present duke.\nThis death had been lately pardoned, and peace established by the\nking in the town of Chartres, and proclaimed by letters patent. He\nadded, that should any of the conditions of that treaty of Chartres be\nunaccomplished by him, he was ready to fulfil them, and willing to do\nany thing else that would afford satisfaction.\n\nWhen he had concluded his speech, the nobles and knights present\nunanimously replied, that they would serve him to the utmost of their\npower. The meeting then broke up, and each man returned to his own\ncountry and home.\n\nThe marshal Boucicaut went to Paris, and in full council, presided\nby the duke of Acquitaine in the place of his father, he accused the\nGenoese of various crimes, and exculpated himself for having lost that\ntown; and ended by entreating, that he might be sufficiently supplied\nwith men and money to offer them battle and regain it.\n\nThe council deferred giving an answer at the moment, but appointed a\nday for him to receive it. In the mean time, Boucicaut waited on all\nthe principal lords, to interest them in his cause, and to beg that\nthey would press the king and council to hasten a compliance with his\nrequest. It was ordered by the council, conjunctively with the three\nestates, that the Genoese should be summoned to appear before them at\nParis, at the feast of Easter, when many of the nobles would be there\nassembled on other weighty affairs, particularly to have their consent\nthat the duke of Acquitaine should be appointed regent of the kingdom,\nfor the Parisians were extremely pressing that this should be done.\n\nThe duke of Berry, however, was much displeased when he heard of it,\nand, to prevent it, wrote urgent letters to the duke of Acquitaine, to\nthe queen, and to the great council, giving substantial reasons why\nthis could not and ought not to be done, considering how very young the\nduke of Acquitaine was,--adding, that he and his brother Philip duke of\nBurgundy, of good memory, had sworn on the holy sacrament that they\nwould support and defend, to their last drop of blood, their nephew,\nthe king now on the throne, against all who should attempt any thing to\nhis dishonour or disadvantage.\n\nWhile these things were in agitation, the king recovered his\nhealth,--and of course, the duke of Acquitaine was not regent, to the\ngreat satisfaction of the duke of Berry, who was much rejoiced thereat.\n\nIn consequence of the quarrel that had now again broken out between the\ndukes of Orleans and Burgundy, the king issued a proclamation to all\nthe bailiwicks, provostships, seneschalships and governments in his\nrealm, to forbid all nobles, of whatever rank they might be, and every\nother person, to obey the summons or join in arms either of the above\ndukes, under pain of their property being confiscated.\n\nOn the Wednesday of the holy week, the duke of Bourbon and the count\nde Vertus, brother to the duke of Orleans, marched five hundred men at\narms to Clermont in Beauvoisis, and thence invaded Normandy. The count\nde Vertus did not remain long there, but, taking a part of the men at\narms, left the duke of Bourbon, and hastened to the countries of the\nSoissonnois and Valois, to the territory of Coucy, which belonged to\nhis brother, and there placed a good garrison.\n\nTrue it is, that when the duke of Burgundy heard this, he was much\ntroubled, and, as speedily as he could, ordered his men at arms to meet\nhim at Ch\u00e2teau-Cambresis the last day but one of April. But when these\ntransactions came to the knowledge of the king and council, he sent\nable ambassadors to each of these dukes, to forbid them, under pain of\nhaving all their lands confiscated, and being declared enemies to their\nking and country, to attempt any expeditions against each other, and\ncommanded them instantly to disband their forces. For this time they\nvery humbly obeyed his orders, and deferred proceeding further for a\nconsiderable space.\n\n\n\n\n[A. D. 1411.]\n\nCHAP. XXV.\n\n    THE DUKE OF ORLEANS SENDS AMBASSADORS TO THE KING OF FRANCE,\n    WITH LETTERS OF ACCUSATION AGAINST THE DUKE OF BURGUNDY AND\n    THOSE OF HIS PARTY.\n\n\nAt the commencement of this year, the duke of Orleans was displeased\nthat those ministers who had been nominated by the duke of Burgundy had\ngreater influence than any of the others, and that they daily deprived\nsuch as had been attached to the late duke of Orleans, and were now\nhis friends, of their offices. In consequence, he sent ambassadors\nto the king to complain of this conduct, and to require that the\nmurderers of his father should be punished conformably to the articles\nof the treaty, but who were now residents within the kingdom. To these\nambassadors promises were made, on the part of the king, that proper\nremedies should be applied to give them satisfaction.\n\nOn their departure, the king sent to his uncle, the duke of Berry, at\nBourges, to require that he would interfere between his two nephews of\nOrleans and Burgundy, and make peace between them, which he engaged\nto do; and in consequence, he sent his chancellor, the archbishop of\nBourges, to Paris, well instructed by the duke how he was to act.\n\nShortly after, this chancellor, the marshal Boucicaut, with others,\nwere dispatched to the duke of Burgundy, then at St Omer, who, having\nheard all they had to say, replied, that it was no fault of his, nor\nshould it ever be so, that any articles of the late treaties were\ninfringed; for that in this, and in every thing else, he was very\ndesirous of obeying the king. And this his answer they laid before the\nking and council.\n\nBut as the proceedings against the murderers of the late duke of\nOrleans did not seem to his son, and his advisers, to be carried on\nwith sufficient vigour, he wrote letters, signed with his own hand, to\ncomplain of this and other matters to the king, the contents of which\nwere as follows:\n\n\u2018Most redoubted lord, after offering my humble recommendation,--lately,\nvery redoubted lord, two of your counsellors came to me, namely, sir\nCollart de Charleville, knight, and sir Simon de Nanterre, president of\nyour parliament, whom you had been pleased to send me to signify and\nexplain your good will and pleasure touching certain points, which they\nhave clearly and distinctly declared, according to the terms of their\ncommission.\n\n\u2018First, they require and entreat of me, in your name, who may command\nme as your loyal subject and humble servant, that I should submit the\nquarrel that subsists between me and the duke of Burgundy, for the\ninhuman and cruel murder of my very redoubted lord and father, and your\nown brother, on whose soul may God have mercy! to my lady the queen,\nand to my lord and uncle the duke of Berry, who has been in like manner\nsolicited by your ambassadors to labour diligently to establish a firm\npeace, for the general good of the kingdom.\n\n\u2018They have informed me, that you have also made a similar proposal to\nthe duke of Burgundy,--and that, to effectuate so desirable an object\nas peace, I should send four of my friends to my said uncle of Berry,\nwho will there meet the same number from the duke of Burgundy.\n\n\u2018The second point mentioned by them is, that you entreat I would desist\nfrom assembling men at arms.\n\n\u2018Thirdly, that I would accept of letters from you similar to those\nwhich had been formerly sent me at my request, respecting the\nmurderers, and their accomplices, of my late father and your brother.\n\n\u2018Having very maturely weighed and considered the above points, I reply,\nthat I most humbly thank you, very redoubted lord, for your grace and\nkindness in thus sending to me; and I can assure you, that I have no\ngreater pleasure than in hearing often from you, and of your noble\nstate; that I was, and am always ready to serve and obey you in body\nand fortune, to the utmost extent of my own and my subjects\u2019 abilities.\n\n\u2018But as the matters which they have mentioned to me in your name are\nof very high consideration and importance, concerning yourself and\nyour noble state, and as I shall ever be most anxious to show my ready\nobedience to your will, I was unable at the moment to make them any\nreply, excepting that I would send you an answer as speedily as I\ncould. This I have hitherto deferred, for I know you have near your\nperson, and in your council, several of my bitter enemies, whom you\nought to regard as yours also, and to whom I am unwilling that my\nanswer, or my future intentions, should be made known: neither is it\nright they should be made acquainted with what concerns me, or have the\nopportunity of giving their opinions in council, or elsewhere, relative\nthereto.\n\n\u2018I therefore assure you, most redoubted lord, in the fullest manner,\nthat I am your humble son and nephew, ready at all times to obey you\nas my sovereign lord, and most heartily anxious to honour and exalt to\nthe utmost of my power your crown and dignity, as well as that of the\nqueen, the duke of Acquitaine, and all your other children and kingdom,\nand to advise you most loyally and faithfully, without ever concealing\nany thing from you that may tend to the glory of your crown, or to the\nwelfare of your realm.\n\n\u2018I have some time hesitated to denounce to you such of my enemies, and\nyours also, as are in your council and service, namely, the bishop of\nTournay, the vidame d\u2019Amiens, John de Neelles[67], the lord de Heilly,\nCharles de Savoisy, Anthony des Essars, John de Courcelles, Peter de\nFontenay and Maurice de Railly, who, by force or underhand means, are\ncapable of doing me great mischief, insomuch that they have dismissed\ncertain very able men from their offices, who were your trusty\nservants, and have done them very great and irreparable damages: they\nare guilty also of insinuating very many falsehoods, to keep myself and\nothers, your relations and faithful servants, at a distance from you,\nby which, and other means equally dishonourable and iniquitous, long\nfollowed by them and their adherents, have they troubled the peace of\nthe kingdom: nor is it very probable that so long as such persons shall\nremain in power, and in your service, any firm or lasting peace can be\nestablished; for they will always prevent you from doing justice to\nmyself or to others, which ought indifferently to be done to all,--to\nthe poor as well as to the rich.\n\n\u2018This conduct they pursue, because they know themselves guilty of many\ncrimes, and especially John de Neelles and the lord de Heilly, who were\naccomplices in the murder of my late honoured father, and your only\nbrother, under the protection of the duke of Burgundy, the principal\nin this crime. They are his sworn servants and pensioners, or allies\nto the said duke, whence they may be reputed actors and accomplices in\nthis base and cowardly assassination. These accomplices, most redoubted\nlord, appear daily in your presence, and you ought to consider their\ncrimes in the same light as if done personally against you, for indeed\nyour authority was set at nought.\n\n\u2018That I may now say all that I know, I am satisfied, that had not the\ncourse of your justice been checked by the aforesaid persons and their\naccomplices, ample justice would have been done for the death of my\nlord and father, and your brother, with the aid of your officers and\nloyal subjects, as I know for certain that they were well inclined to\nit.\n\n\u2018For this I am very thankful; and I most earnestly pray you, for your\nown honour, for that of the queen and of the duke of Acquitaine, as\nwell as for the honour of your kingdom, that you would do good and fair\njustice, by causing these guilty persons to be arrested and punished,\nsince they are equally your enemies as mine,--and that you would not\nlonger admit to your presence and councils the partisans of the duke of\nBurgundy, but select in their places good, loyal, and able men, such as\nmay be found in abundance in your kingdom.\n\n\u2018When these things shall be done, I will then, under God\u2019s pleasure,\nsend you such answer, that you may clearly know my inmost thoughts, and\nwhich shall prove satisfactory to God, to yourself, and to the world.\nFor the love of God, I pray you, my most redoubted lord, do not neglect\ndoing this; otherwise I see plainly, that whatever supplications or\nrequests I make to you will never be attended to, although they be\nconformable to reason and justice, and that you will be prevented from\nacting in the manner you have proposed, through your ambassadors to me,\nnor shall I be able to do what they have required from me on your part.\n\n\u2018Therefore, my most redoubted lord, I beg you will not disappoint\nme; for what I have required is but just and reasonable, as will be\napparent to any one. My very dear lord, may it please you to order me\naccording to your good pleasure, and, with the will of God, I will obey\nyou faithfully in all things.\u2019\n\nWhen the duke of Orleans had sent this letter to the king, he wrote\nothers of the like tenour to the chancellor of France, and to such\nof the ministers as he knew were favourable to him, to entreat that\nthey would earnestly exert themselves in pressing the king, queen, and\nduke of Acquitaine, to dismiss those of the council who governed under\nthe name of the duke of Burgundy, and whose names have been already\nnoticed,--and that he might obtain justice on the murderers of his\nlate father. Notwithstanding the many attempts he made by repeated\nletters to the king and to others, he could not at that time, through\nthe interposition before mentioned, obtain any answer which was\nsatisfactory.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XXVI.\n\n    THE DEATH OF THE DUKE OF BAR.--THE KING OF FRANCE SENDS AN\n    EMBASSY TO THE DUKE OF BURGUNDY,--AND OTHER MATTERS.\n\n\nIn this year died that valiant and wise man Henry duke of Bar, and was\nsucceeded by his eldest son Edward, marquis du Pont, in the duchy of\nBar and castlewick of Cassel, excepting a part which he had bequeathed\nas an inheritance, after his decease, to Robert de Bar, son to the\ndeceased Henry de Bar, his eldest son, and to the lady de Coucy,\nnamely, Varneston, Bourbourg, Dunkirk and Rhodes[68]. In consequence\nof his death, Edward was styled Duke of Bar, and began his reign\nprosperously.\n\nAt this period, the king of France sent ambassadors to the duke of\nBurgundy, who, beside what they delivered to him in speech, gave\nhim the letters which the duke of Orleans had written to the king,\ncontaining his charges against him and his accomplices. He was much\ndispleased at this conduct, and made reply by these ambassadors, that\nthe charges brought against him by the duke of Orleans were untrue.\nWhen he had received the ambassadors with every honour, he took leave\nof them, and went to his county of Flanders: and they returned to\nParis without any satisfactory answer to the matters concerning which\nthey had been sent.\n\nIt was not long before the duke of Burgundy raised a large body of men\nat arms, whom he sent into the Cambresis, and toward St Quentin; but\nimmediately after, by orders from the king and council, he dismissed\nthem to the places whence they had come.\n\nOn the 15th day of July, master John Petit, doctor of divinity, whom\nthe duke of Orleans had intended to prosecute, before the university\nof Paris, for heresy, died in the town of Hesdin, in the h\u00f4tel of\nthe hospital which the duke of Burgundy had given him, beside large\npensions, and was buried in the church of the Friars Minors in the town\nof Hesdin.\n\nAt this time, a tax was laid on the clergy of France and of Dauphiny,\nof half a tenth, by the pope, with the consent of the king, the\nprinces, and the university of Paris, and the greater part of the\nprelates and cities, to be paid by two instalments; the first on\nMagdalen day, and the second at Whitsuntide following. It was so\nrigorously collected that the poorer clergy complained bitterly.\n\nDuring this transaction, and while the duke of Burgundy was resident\nin his town of Bruges, on Saturday the 10th of July, sir Am\u00e9 de\nSarrebrusse, sir Clugnet de Brabant, and other captains of the duke of\nOrleans, came, with a numerous body of men at arms, before Coucy, in\nthe Vermandois, and Ham sur Somme.\n\nNews of this was soon carried to the duke of Burgundy, who, suspecting\nthey intended to invade and make war on his territories, gave\ncommissions to several of his captains, namely, the lord de Heilly,\nEnguerrand de Bournouville, the lord de Ront, and some others, to march\na body of men at arms towards Bapaume and Ham, to oppose the Armagnacs,\nshould they attempt to penetrate further into the country.\n\nDuring this time, the duke of Orleans and his brothers continued their\nsolicitations for justice, and again sent letters to the king, princes,\ncities, and prelates, to engage them to unite with them in obtaining\nthe object of their petitions. The tenour of the letter they wrote to\nthe king is as follows.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XXVII.\n\n    THE DUKE OF ORLEANS AND HIS BROTHERS SEND LETTERS TO THE KING\n    OF FRANCE, TO OTHER LORDS, AND TO SEVERAL OF THE PRINCIPAL\n    TOWNS IN FRANCE, TO COMPLAIN OF THE DUKE OF BURGUNDY.\n\n\n\u2018Most redoubted and sovereign lord,--we Charles duke of Orleans,\nPhilip count de Vertus, and John count of Angoul\u00eame, brothers, your\nvery humble children and nephews, have, with all due humiliation\nand submission, considered it right to lay before you, jointly and\nseparately, what follows.\n\n\u2018Although the barbarous and cruel murder of our redoubted lord and very\ndear father, your brother, must for certain be most strongly impressed\non your royal memory, and engraven on your heart,--nevertheless, most\nredoubted lord, our grief and the sense of what is due to us from all\nlaws, human and divine, force us to renew in your memory all the minute\ntransactions of that inhuman event.\n\n\u2018It is a fact, most dear lord, that John, who styles himself duke\nof Burgundy, through a hatred he had long nourished in his breast,\nand from an insatiate ambition and a desire of governing your realm,\nand that he might have the office of regent, as he has clearly shown\nand daily continues to show, did, on the 14th day of November in the\nyear 1407, most treacherously murder your brother, our most renowned\nlord and father, in the streets of Paris, and during the night, by\ncausing him to be waylaid by a set of infamous wretches, hired for this\npurpose, without having previously testified any displeasure towards\nhim. This is well known to all the world; for it has been publicly\navowed by the traitorous murderer himself, who is more disloyal, cruel,\nand inhuman than you can imagine; and we do not believe you can find in\nany writings one of a more perverse or faithless character.\n\n\u2018In the first place, they were so nearly connected by blood, being\ncousins-german, the children of two brothers, that it adds to his crime\nof murder that of parricide; and the laws cannot too severely punish\nso detestable an action. They were also brothers in arms, having twice\nor thrice renewed this confederation under their own hands and seals,\nand solemnly sworn on the holy sacrament, in the presence of very many\nprelates and nobles, that they would be true and loyal friends,--that\nthey would not do any thing to the prejudice of each other, either\nopenly or secretly, nor suffer any such like thing to be done by others.\n\n\u2018They, besides, entered into various protestations of love and\nfriendship, making the most solemn promises to continue true brothers\nin arms, as is usual in such cases, to demonstrate that they felt a\nperfect friendship for each other; and as a confirmation of their\naffection, they mutually wore each other\u2019s colours and badges.\n\n\u2018Secondly, he proved the perverseness of his heart by the manner in\nwhich this murder was committed. Under cover of his pretended affection\nfor your aforesaid brother, he conversed frequently with him; and once\nwhen he was ill, a short time before his death, he visited him at his\nhouse of Beaut\u00e9 sur Marne, and in Paris, showing him every sign of love\nand friendship that brother, cousin, or friend could testify,--when,\nat the same time, he had plotted his death, had sent for the murderers\nto Paris, and had even hired the house to hide them in, which clearly\ndemonstrates the wickedness and disloyalty of his heart.\n\n\u2018In addition to what I have just stated, and the very day before the\nmurder took place, after the council which you had held at the h\u00f4tel\nde St Pol was broken up, they both, in your presence and before the\nother princes of the blood who were there, drank wine and ate together;\nand your brother invited him to dine with him the Sunday following.\nThe duke of Burgundy accepted the invitation, although he knew what\na diabolical attempt he harboured in his heart, and that it would be\nput into effect the very first favourable opportunity. This is an\nabomination disgraceful even to relate.\n\n\u2018On the morrow, therefore, notwithstanding all his fair promises and\noaths, being obstinately bent upon his wicked purpose, he caused him to\nbe put to death with more cruelty than ever man of any rank suffered,\nby those whom he had hired to waylay and murder him, and who had, for\na long time, been watching their opportunity. They first cut off his\nright hand, which was found the next day in the dirt: they then cut his\nleft arm so that it held only by the skin, and, beside, fractured and\nlaid open his skull in several places that his brains were scattered\nin the street; and they then dragged his body through the mud, until it\nwas quite lifeless.\n\n\u2018It would be pitiful to hear of such barbarous conduct towards the\nmeanest subject: how much the more horror must the recital cause, when\nit was practised on the first prince of the blood of France! Never was\nany branch of your noble race so cruelly and infamously treated,--and\nyou and all of your blood, and such of your subjects as wish you well,\nought not to suffer such a lamentable deed to be perpetrated without\nany punishment or reparation whatever, as is the case till this present\ntime, which is the most shameful thing that ever happened, or ever\ncould happen, to so noble a house; and additional disgrace will fall\nupon it, if you any longer delay justice.\n\n\u2018Thirdly, he shows his perverseness and obstinacy by false and damnable\nhypocrisy; for after the horrid deed had been done, he came with the\nother princes dressed in black, to attend the body, pretending the\nutmost grief at the funeral for the loss of his brother in arms,\nthinking by this means to cover the wickedness of his sin. It would be\ntiresome to relate all the damnable and hypocritical arts he employed\nto hide the treacherous and murderous part he had acted, until he\nperceived that his crime must be brought to light by the diligence of\nyour officers of justice.\n\n\u2018He then, and then only, confessed to the king of Sicily, and to the\nduke of Berry, that he had perpetrated this murder, or at least had\ncaused it to be committed; and that the devil had tempted him to do\nit, for that in truth he could not assign any other cause for having\nso done. But he was not contented with murdering his body: he wanted\nagain, so great is his iniquity, to murder his fame and fair reputation\nby false and wicked accusations, when he was no more able to defend\nhimself against them. The falsehood of these charges, through the grace\nof God, is notorious to you and to the whole world.\n\n\u2018My late most redoubted lady-mother, whose soul may God receive!\nsuffered the utmost tribulation, not only for the death of her\nmuch-beloved lord and husband, but also for the inhuman and cruel\nmanner of it; and like one in despair, attended by me, John of\nAngoul\u00eame, she waited on you, as her king and sovereign lord, and\nher sole refuge in this her distress, and most humbly supplicated\nthat you would, out of your benign goodness, have compassion on her\nand her children, and would order such prompt and just judgment to\nbe executed on the perpetrators of this murder as the blackness of\nthe case required; and as you are bound in your quality of king to\nadminister strict justice to all your subjects without delay, as well\nto the poor as to the rich, so rather the more promptly ought you to\nexercise it in favour of the poor and deserted than for the rich and\npowerful; for this upright administration of justice is a great virtue,\nand on this account were kings chiefly appointed, and power intrusted\nto their hands. The case that was then and is now again brought before\nyou requires the most speedy justice; for it not only concerns you as\nking, but affects you more sensibly and personally,--for her husband,\nour much regretted lord, who was so treacherously slain, was your only\nbrother, and, consequently, strict justice ought to have been granted\nto her, and done on the murderers.\n\n\u2018You did indeed appoint a day for doing her this justice; on which\naccount, she constantly employed her agents near your person, to\nremind you thereof: she waited long after the appointed day had elapsed\nfor the judgment which you had promised her,--and, notwithstanding all\nher diligence and exertions, she met with nothing but delays, caused by\nthe means of the aforesaid traitor, his friends and adherents, as shall\nbe more fully explained hereafter.\n\n\u2018However, most redoubted lord, I know for certain, that your\ninclinations were very willing to do us justice, and that they still\nremain the same. Our most afflicted mother, attended by me Charles of\nOrleans, again returned; and we renewed our request to have judgment\nexecuted on the assassins of our late lord and father. We also caused\nto be most fully detailed before my lord of Acquitaine, your eldest\nson, and by you commissioned as your lieutenant on this occasion, and\nbefore the queen, every circumstance relative to the murder, and the\ninfamous charges urged by way of exculpation by the murderer, and the\ncauses why he had committed this atrocious crime. We, at the same time,\nfully replied to what had been argued in his defence; and after this,\nour lady-mother caused conclusions to be drawn against the aforesaid\ntraitor, according to the usual customs of your reign, and required\nthat your attorney should join with her in the further prosecution of\nthe criminals, so that they might be brought to justice.\n\n\u2018When this was done, our very redoubted lord the duke of Acquitaine,\nby the advice of the princes of your blood and divers others of your\ncouncil, then present at the Louvre, made answer to our lady-mother,\nthat, as your lieutenant, he and the princes of the blood, and\nthe members of your council, were satisfied, and pleased with the\njustifications offered by our lady-mother in behalf of your brother,\nour much redoubted father, whose soul may God pardon! and that they\nconsidered him as fully innocent of the charges brought against him,\nand added, that substantial justice should be done to her satisfaction.\n\n\u2018Notwithstanding all these promises, there was much delay in their\nexecution, insomuch that she frequently renewed her solicitations\nto you, the princes of your blood, and to your council, and used\nvarious other means to obtain justice, the recital of which would\ntire you: nevertheless, she could never gain the assistance of your\nattorney-general in prosecuting the aforesaid criminals to judgment,\nwhich circumstance is lamentable to think on.\n\n\u2018For the aforesaid traitor, well knowing your inclination to execute\njustice, knowing also that his crime could by no means be justified, in\norder to prevent matters being pushed to extremity, (notwithstanding\nyour positive orders to him, to forbid his appearing at Paris, with any\nbody of men at arms) came thither with a powerful force, composed of\nforeigners, and several who had been banished your realm, who did great\nmischief to the countries through which they passed, as is notorious to\nevery one.\n\n\u2018Your and our lady the queen, with the duke of Acquitaine, your son\nand heir, and the princes of the blood, were forced to quit your\ncapital before he arrived there. He remained, therefore, in your\ntown of Paris lord paramount, and conducted himself in a tyrannical\nmanner, subversive of your dominion, and contrary to the interests\nof the people. To avoid greater inconveniences and oppressions on\nyour subjects from him and his men at arms, it was judged expedient\nthat you, the royal family and council of state should, according to\nhis good pleasure, come to Chartres, and there grant him whatever\nhe should ask. Thus he thought he should be acquitted of all the\ntraitorous acts and murders which he had committed, by trampling your\njustice under his feet. Consequently he refuses to suffer any of your\nofficers to take cognizance of his crimes, and has not condescended to\nhumiliate himself before you, whom he has troubled and offended more\nthan can be told. He is not, therefore, capable of receiving any grace\nby law or reason; nor worthy of being admitted to your presence, and\nhaving any favours shown to him or to his dependants and friends. He\nshould have presented himself before you in all humility and contrition\nfor his offences; whereas he has done precisely the contrary, and has\nso obstinately persisted in his wickedness that he has had the boldness\nto avow to yourself publicly, and before so great an assembly as met at\nChartres, that he put your only brother to death for your welfare and\nthat of the state.\n\n\u2018He wishes also to maintain, that you told him you were not displeased\nthat it had been done. This has shocked every loyal ear that has heard\nit, and will shock still more the generations to come, who shall read\nand learn that a king of France (the greatest monarch in Christendom)\nshould not have been displeased at the most inhuman and traitorous\nmurder of his only brother.\n\n\u2018This is so manifestly treason of the deepest die against your\nown honour, and that of your crown and kingdom, that scarcely any\npunishments ordered by law and justice are capable of making reparation\nfor it. It is also greatly prejudicial to the far-famed justice of your\ncourts of law.\n\n\u2018Notwithstanding the excuses which he made to you, that the murder\nof your brother had been committed for your personal security, and\nthe good of your kingdom, it is notorious, that it had been plotted\na very long time, through his immeasurable ambition of obtaining the\ngovernment of your realm, as I have before stated. He has declared to\nseveral of his dependants and officers, that there never before was\ncommitted in this country so base a murder; and yet, in his defence, he\nsays it was done for the public good, and for your personal safety.\n\n\u2018It is therefore very clear, according to law and equity, that every\nthing done at Chartres on that day is null and void; and what perhaps\nis as deserving of punishment as the commission of the crime itself\nis, that he never deigned to pay you any honour, respect, or condolence\nfor such a loss as that of your brother, nor ever once solicited\npardon, or any remission for his offence whatever. And he wishes to\nmaintain, that without confessing his guilt, and without demanding\npardon, you have remitted all further proceedings against him, which is\ncontrary to all equity and written laws,--a mere illusion, or rather a\nderision of justice, namely, thus to leave a murderer, without taking\nany cognizance of his crime, without penitence or contrition, and\nto prosecute no inquiry into his conduct, and, what is worse, when\nsuch a criminal obstinately perseveres in his wickedness, even in the\npresence of his sovereign lord. On that same day, however, he fell\ninto a manifest and apparent contradiction; for he says that he has\ndone well, and consequently he assumes to himself merit, and requires\nremuneration,--and, nevertheless, he pretends to say that you have\ngiven him pardon and remission, which circumstance implies not good\ndeeds and merit, but a crime and offence.\n\n\u2018He has never offered any prayers for the salvation of the soul of the\ndeceased, nor any remuneration to those who have suffered from the\nloss caused by him; and this you ought not, and cannot in any manner\npardon.\n\n\u2018Thus it clearly appears, that what was done at Chartres was contrary\nto every principle of law, equity, reason and justice; whence it again\nfollows, that from this, and other causes too long to be detailed, all\nthe proceedings at Chartres are null and of no effect. Should any one\nmaintain, that the treaty made at Chartres is good and binding, it may\nvery easily be shown, that this aforesaid traitor has infringed the\narticles of it in various ways, and has been the first to violate it.\n\n\u2018Although you had ordered, that henceforth he should in no way act to\nour prejudice, and although he had sworn to observe it,--nevertheless\nhe did directly the contrary; for, thinking to damn the good fame of\nour very redoubted lord and father, he caused your grand master of\nthe household, whose soul may God receive! to be arrested, thrown\ninto close imprisonment, and inhumanly tortured, so that his limbs\nwere broken, and made him suffer other martyrdom that he might,\nthrough the severity of torture, force him to confess that our\never-to-be-regretted lord and father, and your only brother, whose\nsoul may God pardon! was guilty of some of the charges which he had\nfalsely brought against him, so that his crimes might be excused, and\nthat he might for ever destroy the honour of our family.\n\n\u2018He had the grand master carried to the place of execution, who there,\nwhen death was before his eyes, declared, on the damnation of his soul\nif he told a falsehood, that he had never in his life seen any thing\ntreasonable in the conduct of the late duke of Orleans, or any thing\nthat tended to the hurt of any individual,--but that he had always most\nloyally served you: and should he have said any thing to the contrary\nwhen under torture, it must have been his sufferings that forced him to\nutter what he thought would please his tormentors. What he now said was\nthe real truth, and he uttered it on the peril of damnation; and this\nhe persevered in to the moment of his execution, in the hearing of many\nknights and other respectable persons.\n\n\u2018This plainly demonstrates, that the duke of Burgundy\u2019s conduct was\nprecisely the reverse to what he had sworn to observe when at Chartres.\n\n\u2018He has received into his h\u00f4tel and supported, and continues daily\nso to do, the murderers who slew your brother, although they were\nespecially excepted out of the treaty concluded at Chartres. He\nlikewise, as is notorious, troubles the officers and servants of our\nlate lord and father, who now appertain to us, and dismisses them from\nall the employments which they held under your government, without any\nother cause whatever but his hatred to us and to our house, and to\nthose servants who are attached to us. He even attempted not only to\nruin them in their fortunes, but to take away their lives by means too\ntedious to relate; but the facts are notorious.\n\n\u2018The traitor, therefore, sensible of the horror of his criminal\ncruelty, and that he could not by any means palliate it, has usurped\nthe government of your kingdom (for the sole cause of his murdering\nyour brother was his unbounded ambition),--and, by so doing,\neffectually prevents your officers of justice from taking cognizance\nof his crimes, and likewise creates infinite grief to all your loyal\nsubjects and wellwishers.\n\n\u2018He detains your royal person, as well as that of my lord the duke of\nAcquitaine, in such subjection that no one, however high his rank, can\nhave access to you, whatever may be his business, without first having\nobtained permission from those whom he has placed around you, and has\nthus driven from you and your family several faithful and valiant\nservants long attached to you, and filled their places with his own\ncreatures, and in great part with foreigners and persons unknown to\nyou. In like manner, he has acted toward my lord of Acquitaine.\n\n\u2018He has also displaced your officers,--in particular, such as held\nthe principal posts in your realm; and as for your finances, he has\nlavished them here and there according to his will and pleasure, but\ngreatly to his own advantage, and not at all for the good of yourself,\nor for the relief of your people, which has caused much discontent\nagainst you. The underlings in office he has sorely vexed, under\nfeigned pretences of justice, and has robbed them of their fortunes,\nwhich he has applied to his own proper use, as is well known throughout\nParis and elsewhere.\n\n\u2018In short, he has introduced such a licentiousness of manners into the\nkingdom that all sorts of crimes are committed, without inquiry or\npunishment following them; and thus, from default or neglect of justice\nbeing done on this enormous and detestable murderer, many other murders\nhave been committed with impunity in different parts of the realm,\nsince the melancholy death of our much-regretted lord and father,\nmurderers and other criminals saying, \u2018Our crimes will be passed over,\nsince no notice has been taken of him who slew the king\u2019s brother.\u2019\n\n\u2018On this account, most redoubted lord, my lord of Berry your uncle,\nthe duke of Bourbon, the count d\u2019Alen\u00e7on, the counts de Clermont and\nd\u2019Armagnac, and I Charles of Orleans, wishing to testify our loyalty to\nyou, as we are bound by parentage, and being your very humble subjects,\nhad intended coming to you last year to lay before you the damnable\ngovernment of your kingdom, and to remonstrate, that should it continue\nlonger, it must end in the destruction of yourself, your family, and\nyour realm.\n\n\u2018In order, therefore, that you may hear us as well as such as may\nmaintain the contrary, let there be chosen a sufficient number of\ndiscreet men to examine into the grievances we complain of; and let a\nremedy be applied to them, providing first for the security of your\nroyal person, and for that of my lord of Acquitaine. This was more\nfully explained in the proclamations issued previously to our coming\nto Paris, when, for our personal safety, we were accompanied by our\nfriends and vassals, all of them your subjects; and our only object in\nthus coming was the welfare of yourself and your kingdom.\n\n\u2018We offered to wait on you with very few attendants, but we could\nnever obtain access to you, nor have a single audience, through the\nobstructions of this traitor, who was alway by your side; and he alone\nprevented the goodness of our intentions being made known to you,\nfrom his persevering ambition and his boundless desire of seizing the\ngovernment of yourself and realm.\n\n\u2018We, therefore, finding all hopes of seeing you fruitless, in\nconsequence of agreements concluded with your council, returned home;\nbut to avoid, if possible, the destruction of your country, we must\nagain confederate.--We faithfully observed all the articles of the\nagreement; but we were no sooner at a distance than our enemy violated\nthem in the most essential part. It had been settled that your new\nministry should be composed of men of unblemished characters, who were\nnot partisans or servants, or pensioners to either side; but he has\nkept those that were attached to him in power, so that he has now a\nmajority in the council, and consequently rules more despotically and\nmore securely than when he held the reins of government in his own hand.\n\n\u2018These grievances are increasing, and will increase, unless God shall\ndirect your mind to provide a remedy to them.\n\n\u2018Pierre des Essars, who had been provost of your good town of Paris,\nand minister of finance, was to be deprived of these offices, and of\nevery employment he held under your name. This was done for a short\ntime,--but he has since obtained for him, by letters sealed with\nyour great seal, a re-appointment to the provostship, under pretence\nof which the said Pierre des Essars has returned to Paris, and has\nattempted by force to execute the duties of that office. He came, in\nfact, to the court of the Ch\u00e2telet, seated himself on the judgment\nseat, and took possession of his office with the knowledge and\nconnivance of the duke of Burgundy,--and it was not his fault, if he\nfailed in success.\n\n\u2018Hence it appears plainly, that the late arrangements have been by\nhim, and those of his party, violated; and that he never had any real\nintentions of keeping the treaty is clear from his having consented to\nthe dismission of Pierre des Essars, and then secretly procuring his\nrestitution. It was also stipulated in this treaty, that all who had\nbeen deprived of their offices for having been in the company of me,\nCharles d\u2019Orleans, and the other lords, at the h\u00f4tel of Winchester,\nshould be restored to them; and that, by your orders, and those of your\ncouncil, sir John de Charencieres was to be replaced in his government\nof your town and castle of Caen,--nevertheless, the duke of Burgundy,\nin opposition to these your orders, had him displaced, and solicited\nthe appointment for himself, from hatred to sir John de Charencieres,\nand, having obtained it, now holds it, which is another infringement of\nthe treaty.\n\n\u2018Notwithstanding, most redoubted lord and sovereign, all the diligence\nand exertions made by our much-loved mother, whose soul may God\npardon! to obtain justice on the murderers of our late very dear\nfather, four years have now elapsed without any judgment being passed\non such enormous criminals, although she pursued every means in her\npower.\n\n\u2018In consequence of this failure or neglect, I, Charles of Orleans, have\nof late most humbly supplicated you to grant me warrants against these\naforesaid murderers, addressed to all your justices, that they might,\non due examination of the charges, imprison and punish, according to\nthe exigency of the case, all or any who may have been implicated in\nthis abominable crime. In this I made not any extraordinary request;\nfor justice is due to all your subjects, and cannot be refused them:\nyou cannot believe that any man, however low his rank, in your kingdom,\nwould have a similar request neglected by your courts of justice, for\nI know it could not be refused. However, in spite of every exertion I\ncould make, I have never yet been able to obtain these warrants, the\nreason of which is, as I suppose, that some of your new ministers are\nimplicated in the crime I am anxious to have punished, and therefore\nwill not suffer such warrants to be issued.\n\n\u2018For this reason, therefore, most redoubted lord, have I of\nlate earnestly supplicated you, that you would, from personal\nconsiderations, and for the good of your realm, dismiss from your\nservice the persons named in my letter,--for I therein charged them\nwith having obstructed public justice and disturbed the peace of the\ncountry. When this should be done, I declared to your ambassadors,\nthat I was willing, from my love to your person and attachment to your\nkingdom, to make publicly known my future intentions, and that my\nconduct should be such as would have the approbation of God and of your\nmajesty; but notwithstanding this, I have not yet had any satisfactory\nanswer to all my repeated solicitations for justice on the murderers of\nmy late regretted lord and father.\n\n\u2018We, therefore, most redoubted lord, again make our petitions that the\naforesaid criminals may be brought to that justice which is due to them\nfor the enormity of their offences; the principal having made a public\nconfession of his guilt in the presence of my lord of Acquitaine, who\npresided, in your absence, at the meeting held at his request in the\nh\u00f4tel de St Pol, and before a numerous body of the nobility, clergy\nand others; and the traitor cannot deny that this his confession was\nmade before a competent judge, and in the presence of such witnesses as\nthe king of Sicily and my lord of Berry your uncle.\n\n\u2018He had before privately confessed to these two persons, that he had\ncommitted the murder without any cause whatever, but through the\ninstigation of the enemy of mankind. This confession, according to\nevery law, ought to be to his prejudice, nor should he be suffered to\noffer any excuse in extenuation of a crime thus publicly and privately\navowed; for he has condemned himself, and ought to have judgment passed\non him accordingly.\n\n\u2018It is very apparent, that such confession requires not any further\nproceedings but the passing of that sentence which the enormity of the\ncrime deserves. Notwithstanding this, our much-regretted lady-mother\nand ourselves have never been able, with all our exertions, to overcome\nthe premeditated delays to obstruct justice; for three years and a half\nare elapsed since we first brought the matter before you, and we are\nnot one step more advanced to the attainment of judgment than we were\nthen. It is painful to consider what may be the consequence of this\nwilful delay of justice to the welfare of your kingdom, and that the\nmost dangerous consequences may ensue, unless a speedy and decisive\nremedy be applied.\n\n\u2018May it therefore please your grace to do your loyal duty, in executing\nthis act of justice, in obedience to God your Creator, to whom judgment\nappertains, and from whom you hold your authority. Have regard also to\nthe good government of your realm, and exert yourself to put an end\nto every obstacle in the way of a just punishment on the traitor. We\nmost earnestly supplicate you to comply with this our request as soon\nas possible, for we are bounden to press you to it, to the utmost of\nour powers, under pain of not being reputed the children of our late\nlamented father, and of being disgraced, and unworthy of bearing his\nname and arms, and of succeeding to his honours and estates: such\ndishonour we will never endure, but would rather suffer death, as ought\nto be the determination of every man of noble heart, of whatever rank\nor estate he may be.\n\n\u2018We therefore entreat you, with all possible humility, that for this\npurpose, and also in order to resist and oppose his wicked intention\nto destroy us by any means whatsoever, it may please you, from your\nbenignant grace, to aid, assist and abet by your power, us to whom\nGod hath vouchsafed so great favour as to cause us to be born your\nrelations, even of your own kin, and your true nephews, children of\nyour only brother,--or, to speak more properly, assist your only\nbrother, who has fallen a martyr to the ambitious views of this\ntraitor. Most redoubted lord, there is no man so poor, who, having had\nhis brother murdered, will not prosecute the murderer to death, and\nthe more earnestly as the criminal displays greater obstinacy. This is\nexemplified in the conduct of our traitor; for it is notorious, that he\nhas dared to write, and to declare to many respectable persons, that he\nslew your brother, whom God pardon! our much-redoubted lord and father,\nfairly and meritoriously. In answer to which, I Charles of Orleans say,\nthat he lies, and I at present decline to make a more ample reply,--for\nit is very manifest, as I have before explained, that he is a liar, and\na false disloyal traitor, and that, through the grace of God, I am, and\never will be without reproach, and a teller of truth.\n\n\u2018Since, therefore, such things cannot fail of being very prejudicial to\nyour realm and to the public welfare, we beseech you most humbly to do\nus that justice which you are bounden to do, and to assist us by every\nmeans in your power, that we may have full and ample reparation for the\nwrongs done us and our family, and that this murder may be punished in\nthe manner it deserves. In acting thus, you will acquit yourself toward\nGod our Creator, and execute justice, of which you are the supreme\nhead, to whom we must have recourse after God.\n\n\u2018That you, our most redoubted lord, may be assured that the contents of\nthis letter are from our free will and knowledge, we, Charles, Philip\nand John, your most humble children and nephews, have each of us signed\nit with our own hands. Written at Gergeau, the 10th day of July, in the\nyear 1411.\u2019\n\nThis letter was sent, by a herald of the duke of Orleans, to the king\nat Paris, and was laid before the whole of the council, where different\nopinions were held as to the contents. Some wished that the brothers\nshould have their requests complied with, and that the duke of Burgundy\nshould be summoned, that they might hear what he had to say in his\ndefence to the charges which they should make against him. But at\nlength the business was postponed, and the duke of Orleans could not\nobtain any favourable answer; for the greater part of those who ruled\nthe king and the duke of Acquitaine were favourers of the duke of\nBurgundy, to whom they shortly after sent a copy of the above letter.\n\nThe duke of Burgundy, on reading it, was convinced that the family of\nOrleans and their friends would very soon declare war against him;\nand in consequence, he immediately began to make every preparation to\noppose them, by forming magazines of stores, and engaging a numerous\nbody of men at arms, in various parts of his possessions.\n\nThe duke of Orleans and his brothers had not only written to the king\nof France, and to the princes of the blood, but also to the principal\ntowns, making complaint against the duke of Burgundy, and requiring\ntheir support. When they perceived that the king and his ministers did\nnot intend to answer their letter, they again wrote to the great towns,\ngiving them to understand, that if redress were not granted them in the\nlegal manner, as they had demanded it, they should seek other means of\nobtaining it.\n\nIt was now ordered by the king, the queen, and the duke of Berry,\nand others of weight in the council, that measures should be adopted\nfor appeasing the quarrels of the dukes of Orleans and of Burgundy.\nAmbassadors were sent to each of the parties, but without success,\nprincipally because the duke of Burgundy would not condescend to make\nany other reparation than what had passed at the treaty of Chartres;\nand his pride was increased by having the king and the duke of\nAcquitaine on his side.\n\nThe Orleans-party were much discontented, but not dismayed; for many\nvery considerable lords were with them, and had promised them aid and\nsupport against the duke of Burgundy to the utmost of their powers. The\nqueen, therefore, and the others employed to negotiate a peace between\nthe two factions, finding their attempts fruitless, gave it up, and on\na certain day made a report to the king of what they had done, and the\nanswers they had received from both parties. Shortly after, the duke\nof Orleans and his faction resolved to make mortal war on the duke of\nBurgundy and his allies, and sent him their challenges by a herald.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XXVIII.\n\n    THE DUKE OF ORLEANS AND HIS BROTHERS SEND A CHALLENGE TO THE\n    DUKE OF BURGUNDY, IN HIS TOWN OF DOUAY.\n\n\nThe following is the tenour of the challenge sent by the three brothers\nof Orleans to the duke of Burgundy, in consequence of the murder of\ntheir late father, the duke of Orleans.\n\n\u2018Charles, duke of Orleans and of Valois, count of Blois and of\nBeaumont, and lord of Coucy, Philip count of Vertus, John count of\nAngoul\u00eame, brothers,--to thee, John, who callest thyself duke of\nBurgundy.\n\n\u2018For the very horrible murder by thee committed (in treacherously\nwaylaying by assassins) on the person of our most redoubted lord and\nfather, Louis duke of Orleans, only brother to my lord the king, our\nsovereign and thine, in spite of all the divers oaths of brotherhood\nand fellowship thou hadst sworn to him; and for the numberless\ntreacheries and disloyal acts that thou hast perpetrated, as well\nagainst our sovereign lord the king as against ourselves, we thus\nacquaint thee, that we shall make war upon and distress thee and thine\nby every possible means in our power.\n\n\u2018And we appeal to God and justice against thy disloyalty and treason,\nand call for the assistance of every worthy man in this world. In\ntestimony whereof, and to assure thee of its truth, we have subjoined\nthe seal of me Charles of Orleans to these presents. Given at Gergeau,\nthe 18th day of July.\u2019\n\nThe above letter was delivered to the duke of Burgundy by a herald\nin his town of Douay, who, having considered its contents, wrote the\nfollowing answer, which he sent by one of his heralds at arms to the\naforesaid brothers.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XXIX.\n\n    THE DUKE OF BURGUNDY SENDS AN ANSWER TO THE CHALLENGE OF THE\n    DUKE OF ORLEANS AND HIS BROTHERS.\n\n\n\u2018John duke of Burgundy, count of Artois, of Flanders, palatine of\nBurgundy, lord of Salines and of Malines,--to thee Charles, who stylest\nthyself duke of Orleans and Valois,--and to thee Philip, who signest\nthyself count of Vertus,--and to thee John, who callest thyself count\nof Angoul\u00eame, who have lately sent me your letters of defiance.\n\n\u2018We make known to you, and to all the world, that to put an end to the\nabominable treasons and mischiefs that were daily plotted in various\nways, against the person of our sovereign lord and king, and against\nall his royal offspring, by Louis your father, and to prevent your\nfalse and disloyal father from succeeding in his abominable designs\nagainst the person of our and his most redoubted lord and sovereign,\nwhich were become so notorious that no honest man ought to have\nsuffered him to live, more especially we who are cousin-german to\nour lord the king, dean of the peerage, and twice a peer[69], felt it\nincumbent on us not to permit such a person longer to exist on the\nearth, and, by putting an end to his life, have done pleasure to God,\nand a most loyal service to our sovereign lord, in destroying a vile\nand disloyal traitor.\n\n\u2018And since thou and thy brothers are following the detestable traces\nand felony of your said father, thinking to succeed in the aforesaid\ndamnable attempts, we have received your challenge with great gladness\nof heart. But in regard to the charges therein made against us, we\ndeclare ye have falsely and wickedly lied, like disloyal traitors as\nye are; and with the assistance of our sovereign, who is perfectly\nwell acquainted and satisfied with our loyalty and honour, and for the\nwelfare of his people, we will inflict that punishment on you as such\nabandoned traitors and wicked rebels are deserving of. In witness of\nwhich, we have had this letter sealed with our seal. Given at our town\nof Douay, the 14th day of August, in the year 1411.\u2019\n\nThis answer, as I have before said, was carried by one of the duke of\nBurgundy\u2019s officers at arms to Blois, and there delivered to the duke\nof Orleans and his brothers, who were very indignant at the expressions\ncontained therein. He nevertheless entertained the bearer well, and,\nhaving maturely considered the matter, exerted himself to the utmost in\ncollecting men at arms to wage war on the duke of Burgundy.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XXX.\n\n    THE DUKE OF BURGUNDY IS DISCONTENTED WITH SIR MANSART DU\n    BOS.--HE SENDS LETTERS TO REQUIRE THE ASSISTANCE OF THE DUKE OF\n    BOURBON.\n\n\nWhen the duke of Burgundy was convinced that he could not avoid war\nwith the family of Orleans and their adherents, for several of them had\nchallenged him by letters and otherwise, he vigorously applied himself\nto collect forces to resist them. Among those who had sent him letters\nof defiance, he was more displeased with sir Mansart du Bos, a knight\nof Picardy, than with any of the rest; but of him, and his end, more\nshall be said hereafter.\n\nHe wrote a letter to the duke of Bourbon, which he sent by Flanders\nking at arms, the contents of which were as follow:\n\n\u2018Very dear and well-beloved cousin, duke of Bourbon and count of\nClermont,--John duke of Burgundy, count of Artois, Flanders and\nBurgundy, hopes he remains well in your good memory. In the year 1405,\nyou and he formed certain alliances, which, three years ago, were,\nat your request, renewed and again sworn to, in the presence of many\nknights and of other persons well deserving credit. In consequence, you\nwere to remain my good and true friend during your life, to promote to\nthe utmost my welfare and honour, and to ward off any evil from me, as\na sincere relation is bound to do; and likewise, whenever any thing\nshould affect my own honour, or that of my friends, you were bound\nto assist them or me, to the utmost of your abilities, in council or\nin arms, and to aid me with money and vassals against all the world,\nexcepting only the persons of my lord the king and of my lord of\nAcquitaine, or whoever may succeed to the throne of France, and of my\nlate fair cousin, the duke of Bourbon, your father.\n\n\u2018Should it have happened that a war took place between me and any\nenemy, whose side the late duke of Bourbon embraced, in that case you\nmight have joined your late father, but only during the course of\nhis life, without any way derogating from the articles of our said\nalliance. Now, as we both have most solemnly sworn to the observance\nof this alliance on the holy evangelists of God, and on sacred relics\ntouched by us, to the damnation of our souls in case of failure, I\ninform you, very dear and well-beloved cousin, that Charles, who calls\nhimself duke of Orleans, in conjunction with Philip and John, his\nbrothers, have sent me a challenge, and intend to wage war on me to the\nutmost of their power; but I hope, through the will of God, and the\nassistance of my friends and allies, in council and in arms, and with\nthe aid of my subjects and vassals, to make a successful defence of my\nhonour against their attempts.\n\n\u2018And since, very dear and well-beloved cousin, you have so solemnly\nbound yourself to assist me on every lawful occasion, I now,\ntherefore, in virtue of this alliance, require and summon you to come\npersonally to my aid, attended by as many of your friends and men\nat arms as you can collect, in opposition to the aforesaid Charles,\nPhilip and John, and thus honourably acquit yourself of your oaths and\npromises,--knowing, at the same time, that on a similar occasion I\nwould accomplish every article of my oaths, without any fraud whatever.\nAnd this I hope you will do.--Have the goodness to write to me by the\nreturn of the bearer, to inform me of your pleasure and intentions, as\nthe necessity of the case requires it.\n\n\u2018Given at my town of Douay, and sealed with my great seal appendant to\nthese presents, the 14th day of August, in the year 1411.\u2019\n\nThis letter was delivered by the aforesaid herald to the duke of\nBourbon, who, having fully read and considered its contents, replied\nto the herald, that he would speedily send his answer to the duke of\nBurgundy. This he did; for in a few days he returned the articles of\nconfederation, which he had formed with the duke of Burgundy, declaring\nthem annulled, and strictly united himself to the duke of Orleans and\nhis brothers, to the great displeasure of the duke of Burgundy, but\nwho at that time could not redress it.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XXXI.\n\n    A ROYAL PROCLAMATION IS ISSUED, THAT NO PERSON WHATEVER BEAR\n    ARMS FOR EITHER OF THE PARTIES OF THE DUKES OF ORLEANS OR OF\n    BURGUNDY.--THE LATTER WRITES TO THE BAILIFF OF AMIENS.\n\n\nThe duke of Burgundy, fearful that many of his friends would desert\nhim, in obedience of the royal proclamation which had been made in\nevery town and bailiwick through France, strictly commanding all\npersons whatever not to interfere, or in any manner to assist the\ndukes of Orleans and Burgundy in their quarrels with each other, wrote\nletters to the bailiff of Amiens, to his lieutenant, and the mayor and\nsheriffs of that place, and to each of them, the contents of which were\nas follows:\n\n\u2018Very dear and well-beloved,--we have heard from several of the\ndeclaration of my lord the king, by which you are forbidden, as well\nas all his other subjects, to arm in our defence, or in that of our\nadversaries. This proclamation has been issued by our lord the king,\nbecause he was very desirous of establishing peace and concord between\nus and our enemies; and for this purpose he had many times sent his\nambassadors as well to them as to us, to which we have alway replied\nlike a true and loyal subject and servant; and, through God\u2019s mercy,\nall our answers have tended to a good end, and to peace and union,\nwhich has made them perfectly agreeable to our lord the king. But our\nadversaries having persisted in the same damnable and wicked purposes,\nwhich they have ever followed against the peace of my lord the king,\nhis noble family, and the public welfare, by continuing to tread in\nthe footsteps of their father, who, for a long time, persevered in\nhis intentions of destroying my lord the king and his family, have\nacted quite contrariwise, and sent answers full of dissimulation and\ntreachery, with the sole design of gaining time.\n\n\u2018Whilst our much-redoubted lady the queen of France, our very dear\nlord and uncle the duke of Berry, and our very dear brother the duke\nof Brittany, were endeavouring, according to the king\u2019s orders, to\nnegotiate a peace between us and our adversaries, these false and\ndisloyal traitors, and disobedient subjects, Charles, who calls himself\nduke of Orleans, and his brothers, sent to us their challenges, and,\nbefore that time, have often scandalously, and in violation of their\noaths, defamed our person and character as they had before done. This,\nhowever, under God\u2019s pleasure, will fail in having any effect, for he\nwho knows all hearts is acquainted with the steady love and attachment\nwe bear, and shall bear so long as we live, to our lord the king and\nto his family, and to the welfare of his kingdom; and we shall ever\nsupport the same with all the worldly possessions and powers that God\nhas bestowed upon us.\n\n\u2018With these views we have done and commanded such acts as have been\ndone, without paying regard to the scandalous defamations that have\nbeen thrown out against us, or any way fearing a diminution of honour\nby such false, wicked, and disobedient traitors to our lord the king,\nas the aforesaid Charles and his brothers, the issue of that infamous\ntraitor, their father, so notorious throughout the realm.\n\n\u2018In truth, we hold it not to have been the intention of our lord the\nking to prevent any of our relatives, friends, allies, subjects, and\nwell-inclined vassals, from joining us, in the defence of our honour,\nagainst our enemies, and to defend our countries from invasion.\n\n\u2018We therefore entreat of you, and require most affectionately, that\nyou will please to allow such as may be inclined to serve us, who live\nwithin your bailiwick, and all others of our friends who may travel\nthrough it, to pass freely without any molestation whatever; for you\nmay be assured, that what we shall do will be for the welfare and\nsecurity of my lord the king, his family, and the whole kingdom, to the\nconfusion of all disloyal traitors.\n\n\u2018Should there be any thing that we could do to give you pleasure,\nyou have but to signify it to us, and we will do it with our whole\nheart.--Very dear and good friends, may the Holy Spirit have you under\nhis care! Written in our town of Douay, the 13th day of August.\u2019\n\nThese letters were very agreeable to Ferry de Hangest, then bailiff of\nAmiens, and to the others to whom they had been addressed, for they\nwere well inclined to favour the duke of Burgundy.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XXXII.\n\n    THE PARISIANS TAKE UP ARMS AGAINST THE ARMAGNACS.--A CIVIL WAR\n    BREAKS OUT IN SEVERAL PARTS OF FRANCE.\n\n\nAt this time the king of France, who had for a considerable time\nenjoyed good health, relapsed into his former disorder; on which\naccount, and by reason of the discontents that prevailed throughout\nthe kingdom, (the seat of government had been transferred to Melon,)\nthe butchers of Paris, who have greater power and privileges than any\nother trade, suspecting that the government of the realm, through\nthe intrigues of the queen and the provost of merchants, named\nCharles Cudane, would be given to the dukes of Berry and Brittany, in\npreference to the duke of Acquitaine, the king\u2019s eldest son, waited\nupon the latter, and exhorted him, notwithstanding his youth, to assume\nthe government for the good of the king and kingdom, promising him\ntheir most loyal aid until death. The duke of Acquitaine inclined to\ntheir request, and granted them their wishes.\n\nThis done, they ordered it to be proclaimed by sound of trumpet in all\nthe squares of Paris, that the provost of merchants, and others in\nParis, who were numerous, and whom they suspected of being favourable\nto the dukes of Berry, Bourbon, and Brittany, and to their parties,\nmust quit the town before a fixed day, under pain of suffering death.\nIn consequence of this proclamation, twelve persons, men and women,\nwithout including the domestics of the above lords, left Paris; and\nshortly after, the duke of Brittany, hearing of these commotions, took\nleave of the queen at Melun and retired into his duchy.\n\nThe butchers, and those who lived near the market-places, with the\ngreater part of the Parisians, were strong partisans of the duke of\nBurgundy, and very desirous that only he, or those that were of his\nparty, should govern the kingdom; and, to say the truth, it was now\nbecome dangerous for the nobility, of whatever party they might be, to\ndwell in Paris, for the common people had great sway in its government.\n\nIn the mean time, the duke of Orleans and his allies were strengthening\nthemselves, by every means in their power, with men at arms. The duke\nof Bourbon and the count d\u2019Alen\u00e7on came in these days with a numerous\nbody before the town of Roye in the Vermandois, which belongs to the\nking of France, and entered it about mid-day, more through fraud than\nby force of arms, for the townsmen did not suspect any warfare. When\nthey had dined, they sent for the principal inhabitants, and ordered\nthem, whether it were pleasing to them or otherwise, to receive a\ngarrison from them. They then rode to Nesle, in the Vermandois,\nbelonging to the count de Dammartin, wherein they also placed a\ngarrison.\n\nThence they dispatched sir Clugnet de Brabant, who had joined them, sir\nManessier Guieret, and other captains well attended, to the town of\nHam in the Vermandois, belonging to the duke of Orleans: they returned\nby Chauni sur Oise, where they also left a garrison, and in many other\nplaces, as well belonging to themselves as to others attached to their\nparty.\n\nThe duke of Bourbon, on his arrival from this expedition at his town\nof Clermont, strengthened it, and all his other towns in that country,\nwith fortifications. When the garrisons had been properly posted,\nthe war suddenly broke out between the two parties of Armagnacs and\nBurgundians.\n\nThe duke of Burgundy had not been idle in fortifying his towns with\ngarrisons, and in collecting men at arms to resist his adversaries: he\nhimself was in Flanders making preparations to march an army to offer\nthem battle. The army of the Armagnacs had already made incursions into\nArtois, and had done much mischief to friend and foe, by carrying off\nprisoners and great plunder to the garrisons whence they had come. The\nBurgundians were not slow in making reprisals, and frequently invaded\nthe county of Clermont and other parts.\n\nWhen by chance the two parties met, the one shouted \u2018Orleans!\u2019 and\nthe other \u2018Burgundy!\u2019 and thus from this accursed war, carried on in\ndifferent parts, the country suffered great tribulation.\n\nThe duke of Burgundy, however, had the king on his side, and those also\nwho governed him: he resided in his h\u00f4tel of St Pol in Paris, and the\ngreater part of its inhabitants were likewise attached to the duke of\nBurgundy.\n\nAt that time, the governors of Paris were Waleran count de St Pol and\nJohn of Luxembourg[70], his nephew, who was very young, Enguerrand\nde Bournouville, and other captains. They frequently made sallies,\nwell accompanied by men at arms, on the Armagnacs, who at times even\nadvanced to the gates of Paris. They were particularly careful in\nguarding the person of the king, to prevent him from being seduced by\nthe Orleans-party, and carried out of the town.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XXXIII.\n\n    SIR CLUGNET DE BRABANT IS NEAR TAKING RETHEL.--HE OVERRUNS THE\n    COUNTRY OF BURGUNDY.--OTHER TRIBULATIONS ARE NOTICED.\n\n\nSir Clugnet de Brabant, who always styled himself admiral of France,\none day assembled two thousand combatants, or thereabout, whom he\nmarched as speedily as he could from their different garrisons, to the\ncountry of the Rethelois, having with them scaling ladders and other\nwarlike machines. They arrived at the ditches of the town of Rethel\nabout sun-rise, and instantly made a very sharp assault, thinking to\nsurprise the garrison and plunder the town. The inhabitants, however,\nhad received timely notice of their intentions, and had prepared\nthemselves for resistance as speedily as they could.--Nevertheless,\nthe assault lasted a considerable time with much vigour on both sides,\ninsomuch that many were killed and wounded of each party.\n\nAmong the latter was sir Clugnet de Brabant, who, judging from the\ndefence which was made, that he could not gain the place, ordered\nthe retreat to be sounded; and his men marched into the plain,\ncarrying with them the dead and wounded. He then divided them into two\ncompanies; the one of which marched through the country of the Laonnois\nto Coucy and Chauni, plundering what they could lay hands on, and\nmaking all prisoners whom they met on their retreat.\n\nThe other company marched through part of the empire, by the county of\nGuise, passing through the Cambresis, and driving before them, like\nthe others, all they could find, especially great numbers of cattle,\nand thus returned to the town of Ham sur Somme and to their different\ngarrisons.\n\nWhen they had reposed themselves for eight days, they again took the\nfield with six thousand combatants, and marched for the county of\nArtois. They came before the town of Bapaume, belonging to the duke of\nBurgundy, and, on their arrival, won the barriers, and advanced to the\ngates, where there was a severe skirmish. But the lord de Heilly, sir\nHugh de Busse, the lord d\u2019Ancuelles and other valiant men at arms, who\nhad been stationed there by the duke of Burgundy, made a sally, and\ndrove them beyond the barriers,--when many gallant deeds were done,\nand several killed and wounded on both sides; but the Burgundians were\nforced to retire within the town, for their enemies were too numerous\nfor them to attempt any effectual resistance. The Orleans-party now\nretreated, and collected much plunder in the adjacent country, which\nthey carried with them to their town of Ham.\n\nDuring this time, sir James de Chastillon[71], and the other\nambassadors from the king of France, negotiated a truce at Leulinghen,\nin the Boulonois, with the english ambassadors, to last for one year on\nsea and land.\n\nWhile these things were passing, the duke of Berry came with the queen\nof France from Melun to Corbeil, and thence sent Louis of Bavaria to\nthe duke of Acquitaine in Paris, and to those who governed the king,\nand also to the butchers, to request that they would be pleased to\nallow him to attend the queen to Paris, and to reside in his h\u00f4tel of\nNeele, near to the king his nephew, since he was determined no way to\ninterfere in the war between the dukes of Orleans and Burgundy.\n\nBut his request was refused, chiefly owing to the butchers of Paris,\nand others of the commonalty, who had great weight; and that he might\ngive over all thoughts of coming, they broke every door and window of\nhis h\u00f4tel de Neele, and committed other great damages. They sent back\nthe queen\u2019s brother with a message to her, to come and reside with her\nlord at Paris, without delay, but not to bring the duke of Berry with\nher.\n\nThe Parisians, fearful that the king and the duke of Acquitaine might\nbe carried off from the h\u00f4tel of St Pol, made them reside at the\nLouvre, where they kept constant guard day and night, to prevent any\nattempts of the Orleans-party to carry them away.\n\nThe queen, on receiving the message by her brother from the Parisians,\nand suspecting the consequences of their commotions, set out from\nCorbeil, and returned to Melun with him and the duke of Berry. A few\ndays after, the Parisians took up arms, marched in a large body to\nCorbeil, took the town, and placed a garrison therein. They then broke\ndown all the bridges over the Seine, between Charenton and Melun, that\nthe Armagnacs might not pass the river and enter the island of France.\n\nWhile the queen and the duke of Berry were at Melun, with the count\nWaleran de St Pol, whom the marshal Boucicaut had sent thither, the\nmaster of the cross-bows and the grand master of the household came to\nthem with few attendants. The duke of Bourbon and the count d\u2019Alen\u00e7on,\non their road from the Vermandois and Beauvoisis, to join the duke of\nOrleans, who was assembling his troops in the G\u00e2tinois, called on the\nqueen and the duke of Berry, to require their aid and support against\nthe duke of Burgundy, which was not granted,--because the king in\nfull council, presided by the duke of Acquitaine, had just published\nan edict in very strong terms, and had caused it to be sent to all the\nbailiwicks and seneschalships of the kingdom, ordering all nobles, and\nothers that were accustomed to bear arms, to make themselves ready to\nserve the king, in company with John duke of Burgundy, and to aid him\nin driving out of his realm all traitorous and disobedient subjects,\ncommanding them to obey the duke of Burgundy the same as himself,\nand ordering all towns and passes to be opened to him, and to supply\nhim with every necessary provision and store, the same as if he were\nthere in person. On this proclamation being issued, very many made\npreparations to serve under the duke of Burgundy with all diligence.\nIn addition, the duke of Acquitaine wrote the duke letters in his own\nhand, by which he ordered all the men at arms dependant on the crown to\nserve personally against his cousin-german, the duke of Orleans, and\nhis allies, who, as he said, were wasting the kingdom in many different\nparts, desiring him to advance as speedily as he could toward Senlis\nand the island of France.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XXXIV.\n\n    THE DUKE OF BURGUNDY ASSEMBLES A LARGE ARMY TO LAY SIEGE TO THE\n    TOWN OF HAM, AND LEADS THITHER HIS FLEMINGS.\n\n\nThe duke of Burgundy, being now assured that the duke of Orleans and\nhis allies were raising a large force to invade his countries, and that\nthey had already placed garrisons in towns and fortresses belonging\nto him or his allies, whence they had made frequent inroads to the\ndespoiling of his country, was highly discontented. To oppose them, he\nhad sent his summons to all his territories in Burgundy, Artois and\nFlanders, and elsewhere, for all nobles, and others accustomed to bear\narms in his behalf, to prepare themselves to join him with all speed,\nwell accoutred and armed, in obedience to the king\u2019s commands, and to\noppose his and the king\u2019s enemies.\n\nHe also solicited the assistance of his good towns in Flanders, and\nrequested that they would powerfully exert themselves in his favour,\nto which they readily and liberally assented. They raised a body of\nforty or fifty thousand combatants, well armed and provided with\nstaves according to the custom of the country. They had twelve thousand\ncarriages, as well carts as cars, to convey their armour, baggage and\nartillery, and a number of very large cross-bows, called ribaudequins,\nplaced on two wheels, each having a horse to draw it. They had also\nmachines for the attack of towns, behind which were long iron spits, to\nbe used toward the close of a battle,--and on each of them was mounted\none or two pieces of artillery.\n\nThe duke of Burgundy had also summoned to his assistance the duke of\nBrabant, his brother, who attended him with a handsome company; as\ndid likewise a valiant english knight, named sir William Baldock,\nlieutenant of Calais, with about three hundred english combatants.\n\nTheir places of rendezvous were at the towns of Douay and Arras, and\nthe adjacent country. The duke of Burgundy, on quitting Douay with his\nbrother of Brabant and great multitudes of men of rank, advanced to\nSluys, belonging to the count de la Marche, where he lodged. On the\nmorrow, the first day of September, he marched away early, and fixed\nhis quarters on the plain near to Marcouin, where he had his tents\nand pavilions pitched, and waited there two days for the arrival of\nhis whole army, and particularly for his Flemings, who came in grand\nparade, and drew up to their quarters in handsome array.--So numerous\nwere their tents that their encampments looked like large towns; and\nin truth, when all were assembled, they amounted to sixty thousand\nfighting men, without including the varlets, and such like, who were\nnumberless,--and the whole country resounded with the noises they made.\n\nWith regard to the Flemings, they thought that no towns or fortresses\ncould withstand them; and the duke of Burgundy was obliged, on their\nsetting off, to abandon to them whatever they might conquer; and when\nthey went from one quarter to another, they were commonly all fully\narmed, and in companies, according to the different towns and the\ncustom of Flanders,--and even when they marched on foot, the greater\npart wore leg-armour.\n\nAs to their mode of marching through a country, whatever they could\nlay hands on was seized, and, if portable, thrown into their carts;\nand they were so proud, on account of their great numbers, that they\npaid not any attention to noble men, however high their rank; and when\nthe army was to be quartered, or when they were on a foraging party,\nthey rudely drove away other men at arms, especially if they were not\ntheir countrymen, taking from them whatever provision they might have\ncollected, or any thing else that pleased them. This conduct created\ngreat disturbances and quarrels, more especially among the Picards, who\nwould not patiently endure their rudeness, insomuch that the duke of\nBurgundy and his captains had great difficulty in keeping any kind of\npeace between them.\n\nThe duke, after waiting some days for the whole of his army, saw it\narrive; and then he marched off triumphantly, and in handsome array,\nand fixed his quarters on the river Scheldt, near to the town of\nMarcouin.\n\nOn the morrow, he advanced to Mouchi la Garhe, between Peronne and Ham,\nand halted there. At this place, a Fleming was hanged for stealing a\nchalice and other valuables from a church. He thence marched toward the\ntown of Ham sur Somme, where his enemies were.\n\nOn his approach to the town of Athies, belonging to the count de\nDammartin, one of his adversaries, the inhabitants were so terrified\nthat they came out in a body to present him with the keys of the gates,\non the condition of being secured from pillage. The duke liberally\ngranted their request, seeing they had thus humbled themselves before\nhim of their own free will, and gave them a sufficient force to guard\ntheir town from being any way molested.----The duke then advanced with\nhis army near to Ham, but sent forward some of his best light troops\nto observe the countenance of the enemy. The Orleans-party sallied\nout against them, and a sharp skirmish took place; but they were\ncompelled, by the superior number of the Burgundians, to retire within\nthe town. The next day he marched his whole army before the place in\nbattle-array, and had his tents pitched on an eminence in front of one\nof the gates, and about the distance of a cannon shot. The Flemings\nwere likewise encamped according to the orders of their marshals\nand leaders, during which the garrison made some sallies, but were\nrepulsed, in spite of their valour, by superior numbers, and many were\nkilled and wounded on each side.\n\nWhen the duke had surrounded this town on one side only, he ordered\nbattering machines to be placed against the gate and wall, to demolish\nthem; and the Flemings pointed their ribaudequins, and shot from them\nso continually, day and night, that the enemy were greatly annoyed.\nBreaches were made in the wall and gate within a few days; but though\nthe garrison was much harrassed, they repaired both in the best manner\nthey could, with wood and dung.\n\nAt length, the besiegers fixed on a day for a general attack on the\ngate, intending to force an entry: the engagement continued very sharp\nfor three hours, but the garrison defended themselves so valiantly,\nwounding and slaying so many of the assailants, that they were forced\nto retreat. This happened on a Thursday; and on the Friday, the duke\nof Burgundy, I know not for what reason, had it proclaimed that no\none should, on any account, make an assault on the town, but that all\nshould labour in forming bridges over the Somme, that a passage might\nbe obtained for the army, and that the place might be besieged on all\nsides,--but events turned out very far from his expectations.\n\nOn the Friday morning, the besieged were expecting that the attack\nwould be renewed; but hearing of the duke\u2019s intentions to cross the\nriver with his army and surround the town, they packed up all their\nvaluables and fled, leaving within the walls only poor people and\npeasants, who had retired thither for safety. Those persons not having\nability or inclination to defend themselves, the duke\u2019s army, headed\nby the Picards, entered the place without any danger. The Flemings,\nobserving this, rushed so impetuously to gain admittance that many\nwere squeezed to death. When they had entered, they instantly began to\nplunder all they could lay hands on, according to the liberty which\ntheir lord the duke had granted them; for, as I have said, he had been\nnecessitated so to do before they would march from home. Part placed\nthemselves on one side of the street, leading to the gate which they\nhad entered, and part on the other; and when the Picards, or others\nnot of their country, were returning, they stopped and robbed them of\nall they had: they spared no man, noble or otherwise; and in this riot\nseveral were killed and wounded.\n\nThey entered a monastery of the town, and took away all they could\nfind, and carried to their tents many of both sexes, and children;\nand, on the morrow, having seized all they had, they set fire to\nseveral parts of the town,--and, to conclude all, the churches and\nhouses, with many of the inhabitants, were burnt, as well as a great\nquantity of cattle that had been driven thither as to a place of\nsecurity.\n\nNotwithstanding this cruel conduct of the Flemings, six or seven of the\nmonks escaped from the monastery, by the assistance of some noblemen,\nparticularly the prior, who most reverently held in his hands a cross,\nand were conducted to the tents of the duke of Burgundy, where they\nwere in safety.\n\nSuch was the conduct of the Flemings at the commencement of this war.\nThere were many towns beyond the Somme that belonged to the duke of\nOrleans and his allies, who, hearing of what had passed at Ham, were,\nas it may be readily believed, in the utmost fear and alarm; and there\nwere few people desirous of waiting their coming, lest they should be\nbesieged in some fortress, and suffer a similar fate,--for sir Clugnet\nde Brabant and sir Manessier Guieret, as I have said, had already\nabandoned Ham, which was well supplied with stores and provision, and\nhad retreated to Chauni and to Coucy.\n\nThe inhabitants of the town of Neelle, belonging to the count de\nDammartin, seeing the smoke of Ham, were greatly perplexed, for their\ngarrison had fled; but they, following the example of the town of\nAthies, waited on the duke of Burgundy, and, with many lamentations,\npresented him with the keys of their town, offering to submit\nthemselves to his mercy. The duke received them into favour, in the\nname of the king and his own, on their swearing not to admit any\ngarrison, and to be in future true and loyal subjects to the king,\ntheir sovereign lord.\n\nThis oath they willingly took; and, having thanked the duke for his\nmercy, they returned to their town, and by his orders demolished some\nof their gates and many parts of their walls. They also made their\nmagistrates and principal inhabitants swear to the observance of the\ntreaty which they had made, and for this time they remained in peace.\n\nIn like manner, those of the town of Roye, that were but lately become\nsubjects to the king, sent deputies to the duke, at his camp before\nHam, to say, that the Orleans party had treacherously entered their\ntown, and had done them much mischief, but that they had departed on\nhearing of his march, and requesting he would not be displeased with\nthem, as they were ready to receive him, and act according to his\npleasure. The duke told them, he should be satisfied if they would\npromise, on their oaths, never to admit again within their walls any of\nhis adversaries of the Orleans-party. Having obtained this answer, they\nreturned joyous to their town.\n\nThe duke now passed the Somme with his army at Ham, leaving that town\ncompletely ruined, and marched toward Chauni on the Oise, belonging to\nthe duke of Orleans; but the garrison, hearing of it, quitted the place\nin haste. The townsmen, greatly alarmed, sent, without delay, to offer\nhim their keys, and humbly supplicated his mercy, saying that their\nlord\u2019s men at arms had fled on hearing of his approach, from the fear\nthey had of him. The duke received them kindly, and took their oaths,\nthat they would henceforth loyally obey the king their sovereign lord,\nand himself, and would admit a garrison of his men to defend the town.\n\nAfter the conclusion of this treaty, the duke advanced to Roye, in the\nVermandois, and was lodged in the town, having quartered his army\nin the country round it. He dispatched thence sir Peter des Essars,\nknight, and his confidential adviser, to the king of France, to his\nson-in-law the duke of Acquitaine, and to the citizens of Paris, to\nmake them acquainted with the strength of his army, and with his\nsuccesses. Sir Peter des Essars was honourably received by the duke\nof Acquitaine and the Parisians; and in compliment to the duke of\nBurgundy, he was reinstated in his office of provost, in the room of\nsir Brunelet de Sainct Cler, who, by the royal authority, was appointed\nbailiff of Senlis, on the dismission of sir Gastelius du Bost, who was\nsuspected of being a favourer of the Orleans-party.\n\nWhen sir Peter des Essars had finished the business he had been sent\non to Paris, he set out for Rethel to announce to the count de Nevers,\nwho had assembled a considerable force, the march of the duke, and to\ndesire him to advance to the town of Mondidier, where he would have\nmore certain intelligence of his brother. The count de Nevers, on\nhearing this, used all diligence to assemble his men, and set off to\njoin the duke.\n\nDuring these transactions, the duke of Orleans, the count d\u2019Armagnac,\nthe constable of France, the master of the cross-bows, with a large\nbody of men at arms and others, came to the town of Melun, where the\nqueen of France and the duke of Berry resided. Having held a conference\nwith the queen and duke, they advanced to La Fert\u00e8 on the Marne, which\nbelonged to sir Robert de Bar[72], in right of his wife the viscountess\nde Meaux. They crossed the Marne, and came to Arsy en Mussien, in the\ncounty of Valois, dependant on the duke of Orleans, where his brother,\nthe count de Vertus, met him.\n\nThe count was accompanied by a numerous body of combatants, among whom\nwere the duke of Bourbon, John son to the duke of Bar, sir William de\nCoucy, Am\u00e9 de Sallebruche, sir Hugh de Hufalize, with others from the\nArdennes, Lorraine and Germany, who, in the whole, amounted to full six\nthousand knights and esquires, not including armed infantry and bowmen;\nand this party was henceforward popularly called _Armagnacs_, as I have\nbefore observed. Each bore on his armour badges similar to those which\nthey had formerly worn when they lay before Paris.\n\nThe duke of Orleans marched this army from the Valois, passing by\nSenlis, toward his county of Beaumont; but Enguerrand de Bournouville,\nwho had been posted in Senlis with a large force of men at arms to\nguard it, sallied out on their rear, and made a good booty of their\nbaggage as well as prisoners. In doing this, however, he lost some of\nhis men, who were slain or taken, and he then returned to Senlis. The\nduke of Orleans, with the other princes, were lodged in the castle of\nBeaumont, and his army in the country surrounding it.\n\nThe count de Nevers was prevented from joining his brothers as he\nintended,--for the Armagnacs, being the strongest, constrained him to\nconduct his army to Paris.\n\nThe duke of Burgundy was already arrived at Mondidier with his whole\narmy, and was making preparations to combat his enemies, should they\nbe so inclined, or to attack any town to which they should retire,\naccording to his pleasure. But the Flemings were now desirous to return\nhome, and had demanded permission of the duke, saying, that they had\nserved the time required of them on their departure from Flanders.\n\nThe duke was much surprised and displeased at their conduct, but\nearnestly desired that they would stay with him for only eight days\nlonger, as he had received intelligence that his enemies were near at\nhand, with a great army, ready to offer him battle, and that they could\nnever serve him more effectually. At this moment, the greater part of\ntheir officers waited on the duke to take leave of him, who, hearing\nthe earnest and affectionate manner in which he made so trifling a\nrequest, resolved to go back to their men and inform them of it, and\npromised to do every thing in their power in order that it should be\ncomplied with.\n\nOn their return to the tent of Ghent, where all their councils were\nheld, they assembled the leaders of the commonalty, and told them the\nrequest the duke their lord had made, namely, that they would stay with\nhim only eight days more, for that his adversaries were at hand with\na large army to offer him battle. This request having been stated,\nvarious were the opinions of the meeting: some were for staying, others\nnot, saying they had fulfilled the term required of them by their\nlord,--that winter was approaching, when, so numerous as they were,\nthey could not keep the field without great danger. Their opinions\nwere so discordant that no conclusion could be formed, to enable their\ncaptains to give any positive answer to the duke.\n\nThis council was held the 20th day of September, in the afternoon;\nand when it became dusk, these Flemings made very large fires in\ndifferent places, of the wood and timber of the houses which they\nhad pulled down and destroyed in Mondidier. They then began to load\ntheir baggage-waggons, and to arm themselves; and at midnight they all\nshouted from their quarters, in Flemish, _Vax, vax!_ which signifies,\n\u2018To arms, to arms!\u2019 and alarmed all the other parts of the army.\n\nThe duke of Burgundy was entirely ignorant of what they intended to do,\nand sent some flemish lords to know their intentions; but they would\nnot explain themselves to any one, and made answers contrary to the\nquestions asked. During this, the night passed away; and the moment day\nappeared, they harnessed their horses to the baggage-waggons, and set\nfire to all their lodgings, shouting, \u2018Gau, gau!\u2019 and departed, taking\nthe road to Flanders.\n\nThe attendants of the duke of Burgundy, hearing this cry and clamour,\nwent to inform him of it in his tent. Very much astonished thereat, he\ninstantly mounted his horse, and, accompanied by the duke of Brabant,\nrode after them. When he had overtaken them, with his head uncovered\nand his hands uplifted, he most humbly besought them to return,\nand stay with him four days only, calling them his most trusty and\nwell-beloved friends and companions, offering them great gifts, and\npromising to relieve the country of Flanders from taxes for ever, if\nthey would comply with his wishes.\n\nThe duke of Brabant also remonstrated with them on the advantages\noffered them by their lord, and, as he asked in return so very trifling\na favour, entreated them to pay due deference to his demand. But it was\nin vain: they turned a deaf ear to all that was said, and continued\ntheir march, only showing the written agreements they had made with\nthe duke, which were carried before them, and which they had fulfilled\non their part; but, as they were signed with his seal, he had not\nperformed his, in having them escorted beyond the river Somme to a\nplace of safety. Should he refuse to do this, they would send him his\nonly son, then at Ghent, cut into thousands of pieces.\n\nThe duke of Burgundy, noticing their rude manners, and perceiving that\nnothing was to be gained from them by fair means, began to appease them\nby ordering the trumpets to sound for decamping. This was not done\nwithout much loss,--for the duke, occupied solely with the attempt to\nmake the Flemings change their minds, had not ordered the tents to be\nstruck, nor the baggage loaded, so that the greater part of the tents\nwere burnt, with other things, from the fire of the houses caused\nby the Flemings on their departure. The flames spread from house to\nhouse, to the lodgings of the duke of Burgundy, who was troubled to the\nheart,--for he well knew that his adversaries were in high spirits, a\nshort day\u2019s march off, and he was anxious to give them battle; but from\nthis conduct of the Flemings his intentions would be frustrated,--and\nwhat was worse, he knew for certain, that the moment they should hear\nof it, they would publish that he had retreated, not daring to meet\nthem. He was, nevertheless, forced to submit to events which he could\nnot foresee nor prevent.\n\nThe Flemings had no sooner turned their faces homeward but they\nadvanced more in one day than in three before, and whatever they could\nlay hands on was pillaged and thrown into their baggage-carts: they\nhad, moreover, many quarrels with the Picards and English, and it often\nhappened that stragglers were wounded or put to death,--and when they\nwere superior in numbers, they failed not to retaliate.\n\nIt must be remembered, that this retreat took place in the month of\nSeptember, when the grapes in the vineyards were ripe; and they robbed\nevery vineyard they passed, devouring so many that numbers were found\ndead among the vines. On the other hand, they fed their horses and\ncattle so very abundantly on the immense pillage which they every where\nmade, that very many were bursten.\n\nThe duke of Burgundy, on his arrival at Peronne with his men at arms,\nwent personally to thank the Flemings, who were encamped on the river\nside, in the most humble manner for their services, and then had them\nescorted by his brother, the duke of Brabant, to Flanders, when every\nman returned to his home. The magistrates of the great towns were,\nhowever, very much displeased when they heard of their behaviour; but\nthey did not at the time notice it, for there were too many of them\nunder arms.\n\nThus did the Flemings retreat from Mondidier contrary to the will of\ntheir lord, the duke of Burgundy. On the same day, a knight of the\nparty of the duke of Orleans, called sir Peter de Quesnes, lord of\nGarois, at the head of full two hundred combatants, made an attack\non Mondidier, about four hours after they had marched away. He found\nthere many people, especially merchants, and inhabitants of the\nneighbourhood, whom he took prisoners: he slew many, and he and his men\nmade a very great booty.\n\nHe then returned to Clermont in Beauvoisis, whither the Armagnacs had\nmarched in pursuit of the count de Nevers. When they heard of this\nretreat of the duke of Burgundy and the Flemings, they held a council\nwhether or not they should follow them into their own country. It\nwas at length determined by the wisest to return toward Paris, and\nattempt to gain admittance by means of some connexions they had there,\nprincipally in order to have possession of the person of the king,\nwhich was their grand object.\n\nThey began their march, in consequence, towards Verberies, and crossed\nthe river Oise by a new bridge, which they erected, and thence advanced\nfor Paris. Those who had the guard of the king and the Parisians\nwere not well pleased to hear of their being so near, and made every\npreparation to oppose their entrance to Paris. The Armagnacs, finding\nit impossible to succeed, managed so well with the inhabitants of St\nDenis that they were there admitted; and the princes lodged in the\ntown, and the army in the adjacent fields and villages. From that\nsituation, they made a sharp war on the town of Paris, and on all those\nwho sided with the king and the duke of Burgundy.\n\nThey advanced daily from different parts to the very gates of\nParis,--when sallies were made against them, particularly by sir\nEnguerrand de Bournouville, who was one of the chiefs of the garrison\nunder the count Waleran de St Pol, the governor of the town. Severe\nskirmishes often took place, and many gallant deeds were done by the\nmen at arms of both sides.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XXXV.\n\n    THE DUKE OF BURGUNDY ASSEMBLES ANOTHER ARMY TO MARCH TO\n    PARIS.--EVENTS THAT HAPPENED DURING THAT TIME.\n\n\nWe will now return to the duke of Burgundy, who having, as I have said,\ndismissed his Flemings, under the escort of his brother the duke of\nBrabant, went from Peronne to Arras, where he met the earls of Pembroke\nand of Arundel, and sir William Baldock, who had accompanied him on his\nlate expedition. As these earls were lately come from England, he paid\nthem every respect, in compliment to the king of England who had sent\nthem. They had brought full twelve hundred combatants, as well horse as\nfoot, all men of courage.\n\nMuch intercourse took place at this time between the king of England\nand the duke of Burgundy, respecting a marriage between Henry prince of\nWales and one of the duke\u2019s daughters[73].--After he had magnificently\nfeasted these english captains in his town of Arras, and made them\nhandsome presents, he ordered them to march to Peronne, and hastily\nsummoned men at arms from all quarters to meet him personally at\nPeronne, where he had commanded the nobles of his estates to assemble.\n\nThe duke of Brabant did not meet him this time, being detained in the\ncounty of Luxembourg by affairs on behalf of his wife. The duke of\nBurgundy left Peronne with no more than six thousand combatants, and\nmarched to Roye,--thence, by Breteuil, to Beauvais, and from Beauvais,\nthrough Gisors, to Pontoise, where he halted for three weeks or\nthereabout. During this period, great numbers of men at arms came from\ndifferent countries to serve him.\n\nWhile these things were passing, it was ordered by the royal council,\nin the presence of the duke of Acquitaine, the count de Mortain,\nthe lord Gilles of Brittany, Waleran count de St Pol, governor of\nParis, the chancellor of France[74], the lord Charles de Savoisy,\nand other great nobles, that certain proclamations should be sent to\nall the bailiwicks and seneschalships of the kingdom, respecting the\nassembling of such large bodies of men at arms, daily done in defiance\nof the king\u2019s orders, by the duke of Orleans, his brothers, the duke\nof Bourbon, the counts d\u2019Alen\u00e7on and d\u2019Armagnac, and others of their\nparty, to the great mischief and tribulation of the kingdom at large,\nand highly displeasing to the king and disgraceful to his dignity.\n\nThis proclamation again prohibited any one from daring to join the\naforesaid nobles, or any of their party in arms, under pain of being\nreputed rebels and traitors to the king and his realm. It likewise\ncommanded all that had joined them to depart without delay, and return\npeaceably to their homes, without further living on or harrassing the\npeople, and ordered that no hindrance should be given to prevent this\nfrom being carried into effect. Such as should disobey these orders\nwould be most rigorously prosecuted without delay as rebels,--and from\nthat day forth no grace or favour would be shown them.\n\nThis proclamation was published in the usual places, and some few, but\nin no great number, privately quitted the party of the Armagnacs, and\nreturned to that of the king. Those that were disobedient, when taken\nby the royal officers, were in great danger of their lives. Several\nwere publicly executed; and among them a knight, called sir Binet\nd\u2019Espineuse, attached to the duke of Bourbon from being a native of\nthe county of Clermont, suffered at Paris. The cause of his death was\nhis having taken by force some flanders horses that were coming as a\npresent to the duke of Acquitaine from the duke of Burgundy. After he\nwas beheaded in the market-place, his body was suspended by the arms to\nthe gibbet at Montfaucon.\n\nThis punishment was inflicted by order of sir Peter des Essars, who, as\nhas been said, was lately re-established in his office of provost of\nParis, in the room of sir Brunelet de Sainct-Cler.\n\nThe duke of Orleans and his party were indignant at this execution, as\nwell as at the late royal proclamation; and the duke of Bourbon was\nparticularly angry at the disgraceful death of his knight.\n\nThus affairs went on from bad to worse. One day, the duke of Orleans\nfixed his quarters, with a large force, at the castle of St Ouen, which\nis a royal mansion, and thence made daily excursions to the gates of\nParis. He pressed the Parisians so hard that they were much straitened\nfor provisions; for they were not as yet accustomed to war, nor had\nthey provided any stores or assembled a force sufficient to repel the\nattacks of their adversaries.\n\nThe archbishop of Sens, brother to the late grand master Montagu, had\njoined the Armagnacs, but not in his pontifical robes; for instead\nof a mitre, he wore a helmet,--for a surplice, a coat of mail,--and\nfor a cope, a piece of steel,--for his croisier, a battle-axe. At this\nperiod, the duke of Orleans sent his heralds with letters to the king\nand the duke of Acquitaine, to inform them that the duke of Burgundy\nhad fled with his Flemings from Mondidier, not daring to wait his\nnearer approach. He took that opportunity of writing also to some\nof his friends in Paris, to know if through their means he could be\nadmitted into the town. It was lost labour, for those who governed for\nthe duke of Burgundy were too active and attentive in keeping the party\ntogether.\n\nBy some intrigues between those of the Orleans-party and one named\nColinet du Puiseur, who was governor for the king in the town of St\nCloud, this place was given up to them. The duke of Orleans instantly\nre-garrisoned it, and continually harrassed the Parisians; for now\nhe could at any time cross the Seine at the bridge of St Cloud, and\nattack both sides of Paris at once. Thus were the Parisians oppressed\non all sides by the Armagnacs,--on which account, another proclamation\nwas issued in the king\u2019s name throughout the realm, complaining of\nthe continued atrocious and rebellious acts, in spite of the positive\norders of the king to the contrary, committed by the duke of Orleans\nand his allies, to the great loss and destruction of his subjects\nand kingdom; that since such grievous complaints had been made on\nthe subject, and were continually made, he was resolved to have a\nstop put to such lawless proceedings. The king, therefore, with\nmature deliberation of council, now declares the aforesaid family of\nOrleans, and their allies, rebels, and traitors to himself and the\ncrown of France; and in order that henceforward no persons may dare\nto join them, he declares, all such to have forfeited their lives and\nestates, and by these presents gives power and authority to all his\nloyal subjects to arrest and imprison any of the aforesaid rebels, and\nto seize on their properties, moveable or immoveable, and to drive\nthem out of the kingdom, without let or hindrance from any of the\nking\u2019s officers. Given at Paris, the 3d day of October, 1411. Signed\nby the king, on the report from the great council specially called\nfor this purpose, at the h\u00f4tel de St Pol, when were present the duke\nof Acquitaine, the count de Mortain, the count de la Marche, Louis\nde Baviere, the lord Gilles of Brittany, the count de St Pol, the\nchancellor of France, with many other nobles of high rank.\n\nIn consequence of this proclamation, many of the captains and noblemen\nof the Armagnacs grew cold in their service, or delayed joining them\naccording to their former agreements; and fearing greater evils might\nbefal them by further incurring the indignation of the king, they\nwithdrew to the king\u2019s party, and excused themselves the best way they\ncould.\n\nWhile these affairs were going forward, the duke of Burgundy remained\nat Pontoise, as I have before said, and was there joined by numbers of\nmen at arms, as well vassals to the king as his own.\n\nDuring his stay at Pontoise, a man of a strong make entered his\napartment, with the intention to murder him, and had a knife hid in\nhis sleeve to accomplish his wicked purpose; but as he advanced to\nspeak with him, the duke, having no knowledge of his person, and always\nsuspicious of such attempts, placed a bench before him. Shortly after,\nsome of his attendants, perceiving his design, instantly arrested him,\nwhen, on confessing his intentions, he was beheaded in the town of\nPontoise.\n\nThe king, in order to strike more terror into the duke of Orleans\nand his allies, issued other proclamations throughout his kingdom.\nUnderneath is the tenour of the one which he sent to the bailiff of\nAmiens.\n\n\u2018Charles, by the grace of God, king of France, to the bailiff of\nAmiens, or to his lieutenant, sends health.\n\n\u2018It has lately come to our knowledge, by informations laid before\nour council, that John, our uncle of Berry, Charles our nephew, duke\nof Orleans, and his brothers, with John de Bourbon, John d\u2019Alen\u00e7on,\nCharles d\u2019Albreth, our cousin Bernard d\u2019Armagnac, in conjunction with\nothers, their aiders and abettors, moved by the wicked and damnable\ninstigations of their own minds, have for a long time plotted to depose\nand deprive us of our royal authority, and with their utmost power to\ndestroy our whole family, which God forbid! and to place another king\non the throne of France, which is most abominable to the hearing of\nevery heart in the breasts of our loyal subjects.\n\n\u2018We, therefore, by the mature deliberation of our council, do most\nsolemnly, in this public manner, divulge these abominable and\ntraitorous intentions of the aforesaid persons, and earnestly do call\nfor the assistance of all our loyal subjects, as well those bound to\nserve us by the tenure of their fiefs as the inhabitants of all our\ntowns, who have been accustomed to bear arms, to guard and defend our\nrights and lives against the traitors aforesaid, who have now too\nnearly approached our person, inasmuch as they have entered by force\nour town of St Denis, which contains not only many holy relics of the\nsaints but the sacred bodies of saints, our crown and royal standard,\nknown by the name of the Oriflamme, with several other precious and\nrare jewels.\n\n\u2018They have also gained forcible possession of the bridge of St Cloud,\nand have invaded our rights, (not to say any thing of our very dear\nand well-beloved cousin, the duke of Burgundy, to whom they have sent\nletters of defiance,) by setting fire to and despoiling our towns and\nvillages, robbing churches, ransoming or killing our people, forcing\nmarried women, and ravishing maidens, and committing every mischief\nwhich the bitterest enemy could do. We therefore do enjoin and command\nthee, under pain of incurring our heaviest displeasure, that thou\ninstantly cause this present ordinance to be proclaimed in the usual\nplaces in the town of Amiens, and in different parts within thy said\nbailiwick, so that no one may plead ignorance; and that thou do punish\ncorporally, and by confiscation of property, the aforesaid persons,\ntheir allies and confederates, whom thou mayest lay hands on, as guilty\nof the highest treason against our person and crown, that by so doing\nan example may be held forth to all others. We also command, under\nthe penalty aforesaid, all our vassals, and all those in general who\nare accustomed to carry arms, to repair to us as soon as possible. Be\ncareful to have the within ordinances strictly executed, so that we may\nnot have cause to be displeased with thee.\n\n\u2018Given at Paris, the 14th day of October, 1411, and in the 32d year of\nour reign.\u2019\n\nThis ordinance was signed by the king, on the report of his council,\nand thus dispatched to Amiens and other good towns, where it was\nproclaimed in the usual places, and with such effect on the vassals and\nloyal subjects of the king that they hastened in prodigious numbers to\nserve him.\n\nOn the other hand, very many of those who were of the Orleans-party\nwere arrested in divers parts of the realm,--some of whom were\nexecuted, and others confined in prison, or ransomed, as if they had\nbeen public enemies. It was pitiful to hear the many and grievous\ncomplaints which were made by the people of their sufferings, more\nespecially by those in the neighbourhood of Paris and in the isle of\nFrance.\n\nI must not forget, among other circumstances, to relate, that the\nParisians, to the amount of three thousand, as well those of the\ngarrison as others, sallied out of Paris, and went to the palace of\nWinchester (Bic\u00eatre), a very handsome mansion of the duke of Berry,\nwhere, from hatred to the duke, they destroyed and plundered the whole,\nleaving the walls only standing.--When they had done this, they went\nand destroyed another house, where the duke kept his horses, situated\non the river Seine, not far from the h\u00f4tel de Neelle.\n\nThe duke was much enraged when he was told of the insult and mischief\nthat had been done to him, and said aloud, that a time would come when\nthese Parisians should pay dearly for it.\n\nAffairs daily grew worse; and at length, the duke of Berry, the duke of\nOrleans and his brothers, the duke of Bourbon, the counts d\u2019Alen\u00e7on and\nd\u2019Armagnac, the lord d\u2019Albreth, were personally banished the realm by\nthe king, with all their adherents, of whatever rank they might be, by\nsound of trumpet in all the squares of Paris, and forbidden to remain\nor set foot within it until they should be recalled.\n\nThey were not only banished the kingdom of France, but, by virtue of\na bull of pope Urban V. of happy memory, (preserved in the Tr\u00e9sor des\nChartres of the king\u2019s privileges in the holy chapel at Paris), they\nwere publicly excommunicated and anathematised in all the churches of\nthe city of Paris, by bell, book, and candle. Many of their party were\nmuch troubled at these sentences, but, nevertheless, continued the same\nconduct, and made a more bitter war than before.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XXXVI.\n\n    THE DUKE OF BURGUNDY MARCHES A LARGE ARMY FROM PONTOISE TO\n    PARIS, THROUGH MELUN.--THE SITUATION AND CONDUCT OF THE DUKE OF\n    ORLEANS.\n\n\nI have mentioned, that during the stay of the duke of Burgundy at\nPontoise, he received great reinforcements of men at arms from all\nparts: among others, the count de Penthievre, his son-in-law, joined\nhim with a noble company. Having remained there for about fifteen days,\nand made diligent inquiry into the state of his adversaries, on the 22d\nday of October, he marched his whole army thence about two o\u2019clock in\nthe afternoon. As the royal road from that place to Paris was occupied\nby the enemy, he quitted it for that through Melun sur Seine, where\nhe crossed the river with full fifteen thousand horse, and, marching\nall night, arrived on the morrow morning at the gate of St Jacques at\nParis. Great multitudes went out of the town to meet him; among whom\nwere the butchers of Paris, well armed and arrayed, conducted by the\nprovosts of the Ch\u00e2telet and of the merchants, under the command of the\ncount de Nevers, brother to the duke of Burgundy, who was attended by\nseveral princes, noble lords and captains: even the great council of\nstate went out upwards of a league to meet him, and to do him honour.\nIndeed, they all showed him as much deference and respect as they could\nhave done to the king of France, on his return from a long journey.\n\nWith regard to the people of Paris, they made great rejoicings on his\narrival, and sang carols in all the streets through which he passed;\nand because his entry was made late in the day, and it was dusk, the\nstreets were illuminated with great quantities of torches, bonfires and\nlanthorns.\n\nOn his approach to the Louvre, the duke of Acquitaine, who had married\nhis daughter, advanced to meet him, and received him with joy and\nrespect. He led him into the Louvre, and presented him to the king and\nqueen, who received him most graciously.\n\nHaving paid his due respects, he withdrew, and went to lodge at\nthe h\u00f4tel de Bourbon. The earl of Arundel was quartered, with his\nattendants, at the priory of St Martin des Champs, and his Englishmen\nnear to him in the adjoining houses. The rest quartered themselves as\nwell as they could in the city.\n\nOn the morrow, which was a Sunday, Enguerrand de Bournouville, with\nmany valiant men at arms and archers, as well Picards as English, made\na sally as far as La Chapelle, which the Armagnacs had fortified, and\nquartered themselves within it. On seeing their adversaries advancing,\nthey mounted their horses, and a sharp skirmish ensued, in which\nmany were unhorsed. Among those who behaved well, sir Enguerrand was\npre-eminent. Near his side was John of Luxembourg, nephew to the count\nde St Pol, but very young. Many were wounded, but few killed. The\nEnglish, with their bows and arrows, were very active in this affair.\n\nWhile this action was fought, the Armagnacs quartered at St Denis,\nMontmartre, and other villages, hearing the bustle, mounted their\nhorses, and hastened to cut off the retreat of Enguerrand. He was\ninformed of this in time, and, collecting his men, retreated toward\nParis; but as the enemy were superior in numbers, they pressed hard on\nhis rear, and killed and made prisoners several of his men.\n\nThe duke of Orleans and the princes of his party, on hearing of the\narrival of the duke of Burgundy with so large an army in Paris, ordered\ntheir men at arms, and others that were lodged in the villages round,\nto unite and quarter themselves at St Denis. To provide forage, sir\nClugnet de Brabant was sent with a body of men at arms into the Valois\nand Soissonois, where there was abundance. Sir Clugnet acquitted\nhimself well of his command, and brought a sufficient quantity to\nSt Denis; for at this time there was great plenty of corn and other\nprovision in France.\n\nThe Armagnacs were, therefore, well supplied; and as they were the\nstrongest on that side of Paris, they daily made excursions of\ndifferent parties as far as the rivers Marne and Oise, and throughout\nthe isle of France. In like manner, the army of the king and the duke\nof Burgundy scoured the country on the other side of the Seine, as far\nas Montlehery, Meulan and Corbeil; and thus was the noble kingdom of\nFrance torn to pieces.\n\nThere were frequent and severe rencounters between the men at arms of\neach side; and a continued skirmish was going forward between those in\nParis and in St Denis, when the honour of the day was alternately won.\n\nAmong other places where these skirmishes took place was a mill,\nsituated on an eminence, and of some strength. In this mill, two or\nthree hundred of the Orleans-party sometimes posted themselves, when\nthe Parisians and Burgundians made an attack on them, which lasted even\nuntil night forced them to retreat.--At other times, the Burgundians\nposted themselves in the mill, to wait for the assault of their\nadversaries.\n\nThe duke of Orleans had with him an english knight, called the lord de\nClifford, who had, some time before, joined him with one hundred men\nat arms and two hundred archers, from the country of the Bourdelois.\nHaving heard that the king of England had sent the earl of Arundel,\nwith several other lords, to the duke of Burgundy, he waited on the\nduke of Orleans to request that he would permit him to depart, for that\nhe was afraid his sovereign would be displeased with him should he\nremain any longer. The duke of Orleans having for a while considered\nhis request granted it, but on condition that neither he himself nor\nhis men should bear arms against him during the war. The knight made\nhim this promise, and then returned to England.\n\nOn the 6th day of November, Troullart de Moncaurel, governor and\nbailiff of Senlis, having marched about six score combatants of his\ngarrison to the country of Valois, was met by seven score of the\nArmagnacs, who vigorously attacked him; but, after many gallant deeds\nwere done, Troullart remained victorious. From sixty to eighty of the\nArmagnacs were taken or slain; and among the prisoners was sir William\nde Saveuse, who had followed the Orleans-party, when his two brothers,\nHector and Philip, were in arms with the duke of Burgundy. Thus, in\nthis abominable warfare, were brothers engaged against brothers, and\nsons against fathers. After this defeat, Troullart de Moncaurel and\nPeter Quieriet, who had accompanied him, returned with their booty\nto Senlis, when, shortly after, by the exertions of the old lord de\nSaveuse and the two brothers, Hector and Philip, sir William obtained\nhis liberty.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XXXVII.\n\n    THE DUKE OF BURGUNDY LEADS A GREAT FORCE, WITH THE PARISIANS,\n    TO ST CLOUD, AGAINST THE ARMAGNACS.\n\n\nThe duke of Burgundy having remained some time at Paris with his army,\nand having held many councils with the princes and captains who were\nthere, marched out of the town about midnight, on the 9th of November,\nby the gate of St Jacques. He was magnificently accompanied by men at\narms and Parisians, among whom were the counts de Nevers, de la Marche,\nde Vaudemont, de Penthievre, de St Pol, the earl of Arundel, Boucicaut\nmarshal of France, the lord de Vergy marshal of Burgundy, the lord de\nHeilly, lately appointed marshal of Acquitaine, the lord de St George,\nsir John de Croy, Enguerrand de Bournouville, the lord de Fosseux, sir\nRegnier Pot governor of Dauphiny, the seneschal of Hainault sir John de\nGuistelle, the lord de Brimeu, the earl of Kent, an Englishman, with\nmany other nobles, as well from Burgundy as from Picardy and different\ncountries. They were estimated by good judges at six thousand\ncombatants, all accustomed to war, and four thousand infantry from the\ntown of Paris.\n\nWhen they had passed the suburbs, they advanced in good array, under\nthe direction of trusty guides, to within half a league of Saint Cloud,\nwhere the Armagnacs were quartered. It might be about eight o\u2019clock in\nthe morning when they came thither, and the weather was very cold and\nfrosty. Being thus arrived without the enemy knowing of it, the duke of\nBurgundy sent the marshal of Burgundy, sir Gaultier des Ruppes, sir Guy\nde la Trimouille, and le veau de Bar, with eight hundred men at arms,\nand four hundred archers, across the Seine, toward St Denis, to prevent\nthe enemy from there crossing the river by a new bridge which they had\nerected over it. These lords so well executed the above orders that\nthey broke down part of the bridge, and defended the passage.\n\nThe duke, in the mean time, ascended the hill of St Cloud in order of\nbattle, and at the spot where four roads met posted the seneschal of\nHainault, sir John de Guistelle, the lord de Brimeu, John Phillips and\nJohn Potter[75], english captains, at one of them, with about four\nhundred knights and esquires, and as many archers. At another road, he\nstationed the lords de Heilly and de Ront, Enguerrand de Bournouville,\nand Aym\u00e9 de Vitry, with as many men as the knights above-mentioned. The\nthird road was guarded by Neville earl of Kent[76], with some picard\ncaptains; and the Parisians and others, to a great amount, were ordered\nto Sevres, to defend that road.\n\nWhen these four divisions had arrived at their posts, they made\ntogether a general assault on the town of St Cloud, which the Armagnacs\nhad fortified with ditches and barriers to the utmost of their power.\nAt these barriers, a notable defence was made by those who had heard of\nthe arrival of the enemy, under the command of their captains, namely,\nsir James de Plachiel, governor of Angoul\u00eame, the lord de Cambour,\nWilliam Batillier, sir Mansart du Bos, the bastard Jacob, knight, and\nthree other knights from Gascony, who fought bravely for some time; but\nthe superiority of numbers, who attacked them vigorously on all sides,\nforced them to retreat from their outworks, when they were pursued,\nfighting, however, as they retreated, to the tower of the bridge and\nthe church, which had been fortified.\n\nThe whole of the burgundian force which had been ordered on this duty,\nexcepting the party who guarded the passage of the bridge, now bent all\ntheir efforts against the church. The attack was there renewed with\ngreater vigour than before, and, notwithstanding the gallant defence\nthat was made, the church was stormed, and many were slain in the\nchurch as well as at the barriers. Numbers also were drowned of the\ncrowd that was pressing to re-enter the tower of the bridge, by the\ndrawbridge breaking under their weight.\n\nIt was judged by those well acquainted with the loss of the Armagnacs,\nthat including the drowned, there were nine hundred killed and five\nhundred prisoners. Among these last were sir Mansart du Bos, the lord\nde Cambour, and William Batillier. In the town of St Cloud were found\nfrom twelve to sixteen hundred horses that had been gained by plunder,\nand a variety of other things.\n\nWhile this was passing, the duke of Burgundy was with the main army\ndrawn up in battle-array, on a plain above the town: he had with him\nthe greater part of the princes, and his spies were every where on the\nlook-out that the enemy might not surprise him by any unexpected attack.\n\nThe engagement at the tower of the bridge was still continued by the\nBurgundians, in the hope of taking it; but it was labour in vain, for\nthose within defended it manfully.\n\nSome of the garrison sallied out on the opposite side, and hastened\nto St Denis, to inform the duke of Orleans of the disaster that had\nbefallen them. He was sorely displeased thereat, and instantly mounted\nhis horse, accompanied by the duke of Bourbon, the counts d\u2019Alen\u00e7on\nand d\u2019Armagnac, the constable, the master of the cross-bows, the young\nBoucicaut, and about two thousand combatants, advanced toward St Cloud,\nand drew up in battle-array on the side of the river Seine, opposite to\nwhere the duke of Burgundy was posted, and made every preparation as\nif for an immediate combat. The duke of Burgundy and his men likewise\ndismounted, drew up in order of battle, and displayed his banner, which\nwas most rich and splendid. But notwithstanding the eager desire which\nthese princes showed for the combat, it was to no purpose,--for the\nriver was between them, so that no damage could accrue to either party,\nexcepting by some chance bolts from the cross-bows, who shot at random.\n\nWhen the Armagnacs had remained there for some time, seeing that\nnothing effectual could be done, they remounted their horses and\nreturned to St Denis, leaving, however, a reinforcement to defend the\ntower of St Cloud. On their departure, the duke of Burgundy held a\ncouncil, and it was determined to march the whole army back to Paris.\nThe duke lost this day, in slain, not more than from sixteen to twenty;\nbut there were many wounded, among whom were Enguerrand de Bournouville\nand Aym\u00e9 de Vitry, who had fought well, as did the lord of Heilly. In\nlike manner, the earl of Arundel and his men behaved gallantly; and it\nwas one of them who had made sir Mansart du Bos prisoner, but for a sum\nof money he resigned him to one of the king\u2019s officers.\n\nThe duke of Burgundy, on his return, was received by the Parisians with\ngreat acclamations; for they had heard of his brilliant success, and\nthey imagined that through his means they should shortly be delivered\nfrom their enemies, who oppressed them sorely. With regard to the king,\nthe duke of Acquitaine, and the members of the grand council, prelates\nas well as seculars, the reception which they gave him, the princes and\nthe captains of his army, is not to be described.\n\nThe duke of Orleans, learning that the duke of Burgundy had returned\nto Paris with his army, held a council with the heads of his party,\nwhen, having considered the severe loss they had suffered of the most\nexpert of their captains, and the great power and numbers of their\nopponents, whom they could not at this moment withstand with hopes of\nsuccess, they resolved to retire to their own countries, and collect a\nsufficient army to oppose any force the king and the duke of Burgundy\nshould bring against them. This was no sooner determined than executed;\nfor they instantly packed up their baggage, and, crossing the\nnewly-erected bridge over the Seine, which they had repaired, and the\nbridge of St Cloud, hastily marched all night toward Estampes, and then\ncontinued their route to Orleans, and to other towns and castles under\ntheir obedience.\n\nThus, therefore, the duke of Orleans, in seeking vengeance for the\ndeath of his father, gained only disgrace and great loss of men. Such\nof them as were slain in the field, at the battle of St Cloud, were\nthere inhumanly left without sepulture, as being excommunicated, a prey\nto dogs, birds, and wild beasts. Some lords of his party, such as sir\nClugnet de Brabant, sir Aym\u00e9 de Sarrebruche, the lord de Hufalize, and\nmany more, passed through the county of Valois to Champagne, and thence\nto their own homes.\n\nNews of this retreat was, very early on the morrow, carried to the\nduke of Burgundy and his captains at Paris. Some of them mounted their\nhorses, and went to St Denis, when all that the Armagnacs had left was\nseized on and pillaged: they even arrested and carried away, in the\nking\u2019s name, the abbot of St Denis, for having admitted his enemies\ninto that town. Many of the principal inhabitants were also fined,\nnotwithstanding the excuses they offered. Others of the duke\u2019s officers\nwent to the town of St Cloud, which they found abandoned.--Many pursued\nthe Armagnacs, but in vain; for they had marched all night, and were at\na considerable distance before the news of their decampment had reached\nParis.\n\nA few days after, the king, by the advice and entreaties of the duke\nof Burgundy, bought the greater part of the prisoners made at the late\nbattle, by paying their ransoms to those who had taken them. In the\nnumber was Colinet, thus surnamed by many, who had betrayed the bridge\nof St Cloud to the duke of Orleans; and on the 12th day of November, he\nand five of his accomplices were beheaded in the market-place at Paris:\nhis body was quartered, and the five others were hung up by the arms on\nthe gibbet at Montfaucon.\n\nOn the 13th of the same month, a sermon was preached in the\nchurch-square, before the porch of N\u00f4tre Dame in Paris, by a Friar\nMinor, in the presence of the duke of Burgundy, many princes, and a\ngreat concourse of people,--in which he said that the bulls given by\npope Urban V. had been of the utmost efficacy against the rebellious\nsubjects of the king, and publicly denounced the duke of Orleans and\nhis party as excommunicated. They were also thus denounced in many\nother succeeding sermons.\n\nThe ensuing day, the king heard mass in N\u00f4tre Dame, and returned to the\nLouvre to dinner, when he most graciously received the earl of Arundel,\nand caused him to be seated at his table next to the duke of Burgundy.\n\nMany councils were held at Paris respecting this war, and on the\nmeasures the king should now adopt. It was at length determined, that\non account of the winter, neither the king nor the princes should\nattempt any thing more until the ensuing summer, but only have some\nable captains with a sufficient force on the frontiers, to harrass\nand pursue the enemy, and keep him in check. In consequence, the lord\nBoucicaut marshal of France, the lord de Heilly marshal of Acquitaine,\nEnguerrand de Bournouville, Aym\u00e9 de Vitry, the lord de Miraumont and\nothers, were ordered on this service with a very considerable force.\nThey marched toward Estampes and Bonneval, and those parts, having with\nthem the lord de Ront.\n\nBonneval, on the first summons from the above captains, surrendered to\nthe king\u2019s obedience, and the greater part of them were lodged in the\ntown, and in an adjoining abbey of some strength. Those of Estampes\nrefused to surrender, for it was garrisoned by the duke of Berry, and\nbegan to make war on the troops of the king and the duke of Burgundy,\nby the instigation of the lord Louis de Bourbon, governor of Dourdan,\nwho resided there.\n\nAt this period, with the consent of the duke of Burgundy, sir John de\nCroy, eldest son to the lord de Croy, still detained prisoner by the\nduke of Orleans, marched from Paris, with eight hundred combatants, for\nthe castle of Monchas, in the county of Eu, in which were the duke of\nBourbon\u2019s children and his lady-duchess, namely, one son about three\nyears old, and a daughter by her first husband nine years old, with\ntheir nurses and other attendants. The son of sir Mansart du Bos, and\nthe lord de Foulleuses, knight, were also there. The castle and the\nwhole of its inhabitants were taken by sir John de Croy; and he carried\nthem, and all he found within it, to the castle of Renty, where he held\nthem prisoners, until his father, the lord de Croy, was released. When\nthis misfortune was told to the duke of Bourbon, he was much afflicted;\nbut the duchess took it so sensibly to heart that very soon after she\ndied of grief[77].\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XXXVIII.\n\n    THE KING OF FRANCE SENDS THE COUNT DE SAINT POL TO THE VALOIS,\n    AND TO COUCY, AND OTHER CAPTAINS TO DIFFERENT PARTS AGAINST THE\n    ARMAGNACS.\n\n\nConformable to the resolutions of the aforesaid council, count Waleran\nde St Pol was sent into the Valois, to reduce the whole of that country\nto the king\u2019s obedience, and then to march to Coucy with a large body\nof men at arms, archers, and cross-bows.\n\nSir Philip de Servolles, bailiff of Vitry en Pertois, was also ordered\ninto the country of Vertus, with a considerable force, to subdue the\nwhole of it. The vidame of Amiens was sent into the county of Clermont.\nFerry d\u2019Hangest, bailiff of Amiens, was ordered, for the above purpose,\ninto the counties of Boulogne, Eu, and Gamaches.\n\nThe inhabitants of Crespy, the principal town of the Valois, no sooner\nlearnt the intentions of the count de St Pol than they surrendered it\nto him, and received him handsomely. He thence advanced to the castle\nof Pierrefons, which was very strong, and well provided with all\nwarlike stores and provision. On coming before it, he held a parley\nwith the lord de Boquiaux the governor, who concluded a treaty with\nhim for its surrender, on condition that the count would pay him, in\nthe king\u2019s name, two thousand golden crowns for his expenses, and that\nthe garrison should carry away all they had with them. The lady of\nGaucourt, who was in the castle, retired to the castle of Coucy, where\nshe was honourably received by sir Robert d\u2019Esne, the governor.\n\nThe count de St Pol marched from Pierrefons to la Fert\u00e9-Milon, a very\nstrong castle, and to Villers-Cotter\u00eats, both belonging to the duke of\nOrleans; when not only these two but all the other places in Valois,\nhearing of the surrender of so strong a castle as Pierrefons without\nmaking any resistance, surrendered, and returned to their obedience to\nthe king. The Count placed good garrisons in each, and then marched\nfor Coucy, in the Soissonois, where, as I have before said, sir\nRobert d\u2019Esne was governor of the castle. He had with him Rigault des\nFontaines, and others attached to the party of the duke of Orleans.\nThe governor of the town of Coucy was sir Enguerrand des Fontaines,\nand within it were many noblemen, who, holding a council, resolved to\nsurrender the place, and to leave it with all their baggage.\n\nThe count quartered himself and his men at arms in the town and\nsuburbs, and then summoned sir Robert d\u2019Esne, in the king\u2019s name, to\nsurrender the castle. This sir Robert refused to do, saying, that the\nduke of Orleans had given him orders, when he appointed him governor,\nnever to surrender it without his consent or knowledge, and these\norders he had sworn to obey; that it was well provided with all kinds\nof stores, and plenty of provision, so that he did not fear its being\ntaken by force; and he hoped, that before he should be induced to\nyield it, means would be found to restore his lord and master to the\ngood graces of the king.----The count, on hearing this answer, ordered\nthe castle to be surrounded, and quartered his men as near to it as\npossible, keeping up at the same time a brisk cannonade. Among other\nexpedients, the count employed a body of miners, to undermine the gate\nof the lower court, called la Porte Maistre Odon, which was as handsome\nan edifice as could be seen for twenty leagues round; and he employed\ncompanies of miners to work at the other large towers, who were so\nsuccessful that, in a short time, the mines were ready to be set fire\nto.\n\nThe governor was again summoned to surrender, but again refused. Upon\nwhich, the count ordered his men under arms, to be prepared for the\nstorm should it be necessary; and when all was ready, fire was set to\nthe combustibles within the mines, so that when the supporters were\nburnt, the whole of the tower and gate fell flat down, but, fortunately\nfor the besieged, the inside wall remained entire, so that the\nbesiegers were not greatly benefited. Several were killed and wounded\non both sides by the fall of the towers: one of them at the corner was\nprevented from falling to the ground by the wall supporting it; and one\nof the men at arms remained on this inclined tower, where he had been\nposted to guard it, and was in great peril of his life, but was saved\nby the exertions of the garrison.\n\nAt length, when the count de St Pol had been before this castle of\nCoucy about three months, a treaty was entered into between him and sir\nRobert, that he would surrender the castle on condition that he and his\ngarrison should depart unmolested whither they pleased, with all they\ncould carry with them, and should receive, for their expenses, twelve\nhundred crowns, or thereabout. When this was concluded, the governor\nmarched off with about fifty combatants, the principal of whom were\nhis son, le Baudrain de Fur, knight, Rigault des Fontaines, before\nmentioned, and Gaucher de Baissu. The lady de Gaucourt departed also\nin their company. Sir Robert and the greater part of his men went and\nfixed their residence at Creve-coeur and in the castle of Cambresis.\n\nThe count de St Pol, on the surrender of the castle, appointed sir\nGerard de Herbannes governor, with a sufficient garrison. There were\nwith him on this expedition his nephew John of Luxembourg, the vidame\nof Amiens, the lord de Houcourt, and many other nobles and esquires\nfrom Picardy, especially such as were his vassals. Having finished\nthis business so successfully, he returned to the king at Paris, who,\nin consideration of his good qualities, and as a remuneration for his\nservices, nominated him constable of France. The sword of office was\ndelivered to him, and he took the usual oaths, in the room of the lord\nd\u2019Albreth, who had been dismissed therefrom, being judged unworthy to\nhold it any longer.\n\nIn like manner, the lord de Rambures was appointed master of the\ncross-bows of France, in the place of the lord de Hangest, who had been\ndismissed by the king. The lord de Longny, a native of Brittany, was\nmade marshal of France, on the resignation, and with the consent, of\nthe lord de Rieux[78], who was superannuated.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XXXIX.\n\n    SIR PHILIP DE SERVOLLES, BAILIFF OF VITRY, LAYS SIEGE TO THE\n    CASTLE OF MOYENNES.----OTHER PLACES ARE BY THE KING\u2019S OFFICERS\n    REDUCED TO HIS OBEDIENCE.\n\n\nIn regard to the county of Vertus, the moment sir Philip de Servolles\ncame before the town of that name, it surrendered to the king,--and in\nlike manner all the other places in that county, excepting the castle\nof Moyennes. In this castle were sir Clugnet de Brabant, his brother\nJohn of Brabant, sir Thomas de Lorsies, and many more, who would not on\nany account submit to the king.\n\nThe bailiff of Vitry consequently laid siege to it, and made every\npreparation to conquer it by force. It was, however, in vain; for the\ngarrison were well provided with provision, artillery and stores of all\nkinds, so that they little feared the besiegers, and very frequently\ncut off their detachments.\n\nThe siege lasted for upwards of three months; and at the end of this\ntime, sir Clugnet and sir Thomas de Lorsies, mounted on strong and\nactive coursers, followed by two pages, set out from the castle,--and,\ngalloping through the besieging army with their lances in their rests,\npassed safely, striking down all opposers, escaped to Luxembourg, and\nwent to sir Aym\u00e9 de Sarrebruche to seek for succour. But they did not\nreturn with any assistance; for a few days after, John of Brabant was\nmade prisoner in a sally from the castle, and, by order of the king and\ncouncil, beheaded in the town of Vitry. After this event, the remainder\nof the garrison surrendered themselves to the king\u2019s obedience, on\nstipulating with the bailiff that they were to have their lives and\nfortunes spared. He instantly new-garrisoned the castle.\n\nThus was that whole country reduced to the king\u2019s obedience; and that\nof Clermont followed the example, by surrendering to the vidame of\nAmiens without making any resistance. The garrisons in the different\ntowns and castles that had done great mischief to the surrounding\ncountry withdrew with all their baggage, under the protection of\npassports, to the Bourbonois, and were replaced by the king\u2019s troops.\n\nThe bailiff of Amiens was equally successful at Boulogne-sur-mer,\nwhich, with all the adjacent places, surrendered, excepting the castle\nof Boulogne,--the seneschal of which, by name sir Louis de Corail,\na native of Auvergne, would not yield it without the permission of\nhis lord, the duke of Berry, who had intrusted it to his guard. The\nbailiff, however, with his men, destroyed the drawbridge, and filled\nup the ditches, so that no one could enter or come out of the castle.\nA parley took place between the governor and bailiff, when the first\nwas allowed to send to his lord, the duke of Berry, to know if he would\nconsent that the castle should be given up to the king, and hold him\ndischarged for so doing.\n\nThe duke, in answer, bade him surrender the castle to the king\u2019s\nofficers, and come to him at Bourges, which was done. In like manner,\nall the places in the county of Eu, and in the territory of Gamaches,\nwere surrendered to the king; and the officers who had been placed in\nthem by their lords were dismissed, and others of the king\u2019s servants\nput in their room.\n\nDuring this time, very large sums of money were raised in Paris and\nelsewhere, to pay the english troops who had come to serve the duke\nof Burgundy by permission of the king of England. On receiving their\npayment, the earl of Arundel, with his men, returned to England by\nway of Calais; but the earl of Kent[79] and his troops remained in the\nservice of the duke of Burgundy.\n\nAt this moment, the Orleans-party were in great distress, and knew not\nwhere to save themselves; for the instant any of them were discovered,\nwhether secular or ecclesiastic, they were arrested and imprisoned, and\nsome executed,--others heavily fined. Two monks were arrested at this\ntime, namely, master Peter Fresnel, bishop of Noyon, who was taken by\nsir Anthony de Craon, and carried from Noyon to the castle of Crotoy;\nthe other, the abbot of Foresmoustier, was made prisoner by the lord\nde Dampierre, admiral of France. They were soon delivered on paying a\nlarge ransom, when each returned to his bishoprick and monastery.\n\nThe lord de Hangest, still calling himself grand master of the french\ncross-bows, being attached to the Orleans-party, had, after the retreat\nfrom St Denis, secretly retired to the castle of Soissons. Having a\ndesire to attempt regaining the king\u2019s favour, he sent a poursuivant\nto demand a safe conduct from Troullart de Moncaurel, bailiff and\ngovernor of Senlis, for him to come and reside in that town. The safe\nconduct was sent to him, and he came to Senlis; but, because there was\nno mention of his return in this permission, Troullart made him and\nfifteen other gentlemen prisoners in the king\u2019s name. Shortly after,\nthey were carried to the Ch\u00e2telet in Paris, to his great displeasure,\nbut he could not prevent it.\n\nThe count de Roussy also had retired, after the retreat from St Denis,\nto his castle of Pont \u00e1 Arsy sur Aine; but it was instantly surrounded\nby the peasants of the Laonnois, who increased to about fifteen\nhundred, and made most terrible assaults on the castle,--and, in spite\nof its deep moat and thick walls, they damaged it very much. These\npeasants called themselves the king\u2019s children. Sir Brun de Barins,\nknight, bailiff of the Vermandois, and the provost of Laon, came to\nassist and to command them,--when the count, perceiving the danger he\nwas in, to avoid falling into the hands of these peasants, surrendered\nhimself and his castle to the bailiff of the Vermandois, on condition\nthat his own life, and the lives of all within it, should be spared.\nThe bailiff accepted the terms, and, having re-garrisoned it with the\nking\u2019s troops, carried the count and his men prisoners to Laon, where\nthey remained a long time; but at length, on paying a heavy ransom,\nthey obtained their liberty.\n\nThe archdeacon of Brie was, in like manner, taken in the tower of\nAndely by these peasants. He was natural son to the king of Armenia.\nSir William de Coussy, who was of the Orleans-party, retired to his\nbrother in Lorraine, who was bishop of Metz.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XL.\n\n    THE DUKES OF ACQUITAINE AND BURGUNDY MARCH TO CONQUER ESTAMPES\n    AND DOURDAN.----THE EXECUTION OF SIR MANSART DU BOS AND OTHER\n    PRISONERS.\n\n\nDuring these tribulations, there were so many grievous complaints made\nto the king and the princes at Paris, of the mischiefs done to the\ncountry by the garrisons of Estampes and Dourdan, that notwithstanding\nit had been determined in council that neither the king nor the duke\nof Acquitaine should take the field until the winter should be passed,\nthis resolution was overruled by circumstances.\n\nOn the 23d day of November, the duke of Acquitaine, accompanied by the\nduke of Burgundy, the counts of Nevers, de la Marche, de Penthievre,\nde Vaudemont, and the marshal de Boucicaut, with others of rank, and a\ngreat multitude of the Parisians on foot, marched out of Paris, with\nthe intent to reduce to the king\u2019s obedience the garrisons of Estampes\nand Dourdan, and some others, who continued the war on the part of the\nduke of Orleans and his adherents.\n\nHe halted at Corbeil to wait for the whole of his forces,--and thence,\nwith an immense quantity of warlike stores and bombards, with other\nartillery, marched his army toward Estampes, wherein was sir Louis\nde Bourdon, who instantly withdrew into the castle. The townsmen\nimmediately returned to their former obedience, and were kindly\nreceived by the duke of Acquitaine, in consideration of his uncle the\nduke of Berry. Sir Louis de Bourdon, however, refused to surrender,\nalthough he was summoned many times, when the castle was besieged on\nall sides. The lord de Ront was at this time prisoner there,--for he\nhad been taken by sir Louis not long before the arrival of the duke of\nAcquitaine.\n\nMany engines were now pointed against the walls, which they damaged in\nseveral places; and in addition, miners were employed to underwork the\ntowers. The siege was carried on with such vigour that the garrison,\nthinking it probable they should be taken by storm, opened a parley,\nand, by means of the lord de Ront, surrendered themselves to the duke\nof Acquitaine. Sir Louis de Bourdon, with some other gentlemen, his\nconfederates, were sent to the Ch\u00e2telet at Paris. Great part of the\nwealth of Bourdon, with a most excellent courser of his, were given to\nthe lord de Ront, to make amends for the losses which he sustained when\nhe was made prisoner.\n\nThe dukes of Acquitaine and Burgundy re-garrisoned this place, and\nthen returned with their army to Paris; for in truth, they could not,\nfrom the severity of the winter, make any further progress. A few days\nafter, by order of the duke of Burgundy, many noble prisoners were\ncarried from Paris to the castle of Lille; among whom were the lord de\nHangest, sir Louis de Bourdon, the lords de Gerennes, des Fontaines,\nsir John d\u2019Amboise and others, who had been arrested for supporting the\nparty of the duke of Orleans. They suffered a long confinement, but\nwere set at liberty on paying a heavy fine.\n\nAt this period, sir Mansart du Bos was beheaded in the market-place\nof Paris, his body hung by the shoulders on the gibbet at Montfaucon,\nand his head affixed to the spike on the top of the market-house.\nThis execution took place at the instance of the duke of Burgundy,\nbecause sir Mansart was his liege man, nevertheless he had sent him his\nchallenge at the same time with the brothers of Orleans, as has been\nbefore noticed. Not all the solicitations of his friends could save\nhim, and he had many of weight with the duke, who endeavoured earnestly\nto obtain his pardon; but it was in vain, for the duke had resolved\nupon his death.\n\nThere were in the prisons of the Ch\u00e2telet, and in other prisons of\nParis, very many of the Orleans-party who perished miserably through\ncold, famine, and neglect. When dead, they were inhumanly dragged\nout of the town, and thrown into the ditches a prey to dogs, birds,\nand wild beasts. The reason of such cruel conduct was their having\nbeen several times denounced from the pulpits, and proclaimed from\nthe squares, as excommunicated persons. It seemed, however, to many\ndiscreet men, as well noble as of the church, that it was a great\nscandal thus to treat those who were Christians and acknowledged the\nlaws of JESUS CHRIST.\n\nThe same rigorous conduct being persevered in, a short time after,\na valiant knight, called sir Peter de Famechon, was beheaded in the\nmarket-place of Paris: he was of the household and family of the duke\nof Bourbon,--and his head was affixed to a lance like the others. The\nduke of Bourbon was much exasperated at his death, especially when he\nwas informed of the disgraceful circumstances that had attended it. At\nthis time, therefore, all who sided with the Armagnacs, and were taken,\nran great risk of their lives; for there were few that dared speak in\ntheir favour, however near their connexions might be.\n\n\nEND OF THE SECOND VOLUME.\n\n\n  AT THE HAFOD PRESS,\n  BY JA.

This last condition, however, was not\ncompletely fulfilled until the reign of Sigismond Augustus in 1569.\n\n  _Baudran._\n\nJagellon took the name of Uladislaus V. on his baptism; but Hedwige,\ndaughter to the king of Poland, reigned two years before she married\nUladislaus.\n\n  _Anderson._\n\n\n[54] Sigismond was king of Hungary in 1387,--roman emperor 1411,--king\nof Bohemia 1419,--died 1437, aged 70. He married for his second wife\nBarbara, daughter to Hermannus II. count of Cilly in Crain.\n\n  _Anderson._\n\n\n[55] Of the half blood. See p. 138.\n\n[56] _I. e._ Bari.\n\n[57] Probably Nicholas d\u2019Este, connected by marriage with the house of\nMalatesta.\n\n[58] Probably Pandulph Malatesta, lord of Rimini, a captain of great\nreputation and adherent of king Ladislaus.\n\n[59] Sir Raoul de Gaucourt, successively promoted to the posts of\nchamberlain, governor of Dauphin\u00e8, and grand master of the household,\nbecame a distinguished actor in the wars with the English, from 1427 to\n1437 particularly.\n\nThere was also a sir Eustace de Gaucourt, lord of Vicy, who was grand\nfalconer in 1406 and 1412.\n\n[60] Count de Hembe. Q.\n\n[61] Charles de Mouroufle. Q.\n\n[62] The author of \u2018An Account of Livonia, with a Relation of the Rise,\nProgress and Decay of the Marian Teutonic Order,\u2019 London, 1701, relates\nthese transactions in the manner following:\n\n\u2018The order was now on the highest pinnacle of prosperity and honour,\nexceeding great kings and potentates of Europe in extent of dominions,\npower and riches, when Ulricus \u00e0 Jungingen was chosen great master; but\nhe being of a boisterous, fiery temper, soon broke the peace concluded\nbetween Poland with his brother Conradus \u00e0 Jungingen, whereupon\nking Uladislaus Jagellon joining forces with his father Witoldas of\nLithuania, formed an army of 150,000 fighting men and marched into\nPrussia. To stop the progress of this formidable army, the great master\ndrew up as many forces as he could, and, after the Livonians had\njoined him, found his army consisted, in a general muster, of 83,000\nwell armed stout combatants; and thus, with an undaunted spirit, he\nmarched forth to meet his enemy. Such a battle as this was never heard\nof before in these parts, and was given the 15th day of July 1410 in\nPrussia, near the town Gilgenbourg, between the two villages Tannenberg\nand Grunwald, on a large plain, with such obstinacy that, according\nto an exact computation, there were actually killed, on both sides,\n100,000 on the spot. The Poles got the victory, but lost 60,000 men.\nThe order lost 40,000,--but among them almost all their generals and\ncommanders. The great master himself, and the chief of the order, with\n600 noble german marian knights, were there slain. There is still\nkept every year a day of devotion upon that plain, in a chapel built\nto the remembrance of this battle, marked with the date of the year\nit happened, and this inscription, _Centum mille occisi_. The king of\nPoland was so weakened by this dear-bought victory that he very readily\nagreed to a peace. This memorable battle is called The Battle of\nTannenberg.\u2019\n\n[63] Moreri says, that the good duke Louis died at Monbucan on the 19th\nof August 1410. By his wife Anne, dauphiness of Auvergne and countess\nof Forez, he left John count of Clermont, his son and successor:\nhis other children, Louis and two daughters, died without issue and\nunmarried. He left also a natural son, named Hector, who was killed at\nthe siege of Soissons in 1414.\n\n[64] Boulogne, the property of the duke of Berry, by marriage with\nJane, heiress of Auvergne and Boulogne.\n\n    The county of Estampes belonged to the duke of Berry,\n    Valois, I believe, to the count d\u2019Alen\u00e7on,\n    Beaumont to the duke of Orleans,--and\n    Clermont to the duke of Bourbon.\n\n\n[65] Vinchestre, or rather Winchester,--now called Bic\u00eatre, was a\npalace built by a bishop of Winchester 1290. For further particulars,\nsee \u2018Sauval Antiquit\u00e8s de Paris\u2019, vol. ii. book vii.\n\n[66] I hardly know whether this can be the celebrated archbishop of\nRheims, and historian of the reign of Charles VI. who was one of the\nmost learned men of his time, and died at an advanced age, in 1474.\nHe had two brothers older than himself, William des Ursins, baron\nof Treynel, chancellor of France in 1445, and again in 1464,--and\nJames Juvenal des Ursins, who was archbishop of Rheims before him.\nThe history written by Juvenal des Ursins occupies the space from\n1380 to 1422, and throws great light, by comparison, on Froissart and\nMonstrelet.\n\n[67] Q. De Nesle?\n\nGuy III. de Nesle, lord of Offemont and Mello, was grand master of the\nhousehold to queen Isabella, and was killed at Agincourt. His two sons,\n_John_ III. and Guy IV. followed him in succession. He had a third son,\nwho died with him at Agincourt.\n\n[68] Monstrelet apparently mistakes. According to Moreri, _Robert_ duke\nof Bar died this year, leaving issue by his wife Mary (daughter to John\nking of France),\n\n    1. Henry lord d\u2019Ossy, who died in Hungary, 1396, leaving by his\n    wife Mary de Coucy, countess of Soissons, one son, Robert count\n    of Marle and Soissons, killed at Agincourt.\n\n    2. Philip, died in Hungary 1396.\n\n    3. Edward III. marquis du Pont, and duke of Bar after his\n    father\u2019s death.\n\n    4. Louis cardinal of Bar.\n\n    5. Charles lord of Nogent.\n\n    6. John lord of Puisaye. (Both Edward and John were killed at\n    Agincourt.)\n\n    7. Yoland, queen of Arragon.\n\n    8. Mary, countess of Namur.\n\n    9. Bona, countess of St Pol.\n\nOne striking peculiarity is discernible in this table, viz. the\npreference shown in the succession to Edward the third son, over\nRobert, son of the eldest son of the deceased duke; but this was\naccording to the law of many feudal tenures, which took no notice of\nour universally-established doctrine of _representation_ in descents.\nThe same law prevailed in Artois, and was the ground of that famous\ndecision by which Robert d\u2019Artois was ejected in the middle of the\nfourteenth century, and in consequence of which he retired in disgust\nto the court of our Edward III. who asserted the justice of his\npretensions.\n\n[69] He was a peer as duke of Burgundy, and again a peer as\ncount-palatine of Burgundy.\n\n[70] John, called count de Ligny, third son of John count of Brienne,\nbrother to the count de St Pol.\n\n[71] James de Ch\u00e2tillon was appointed admiral in 1408, in the room\nof Clugnet de Breban. He was lord of Dampierre, and son of Hugh de\nCh\u00e2tillon, formerly master of the cross-bows.\n\n[72] Nephew of duke Edward. See p. 232.\n\n[73] The advice which, according to Stowe, king Henry gave to the duke\nof Burgundy on this occasion was deserving of more attention than he\nwas disposed to pay to it. \u2018The duke of Burgoyne, desiring the king\u2019s\naid against the duke of Orliance, promised many things,--amongst the\nwhich he promised his daughter in marriage to the prince, and a great\nsum of gold with her. To whom the king answered: \u2018We advertise you not\nto fight with your enemie in this case, who justly seemeth to vexe\nyou, for the death of his father by you procured, but as much as in\nyou lyeth endeavor yourself to mitigate the young man\u2019s wrath, and\npromise to make him reasonable satisfaction, according to the advice\nof your friends; and if then he will not cease from persecuting you,\nget you into the strongest place of your dominion, and there gather\nsuch power as may be able to put off his force. If then, after this,\nhe will make war against you, you shall have the juster occasion to\nfight with him,--and in such case we will shew you such favour as yee\nhave demaunded.\u2019 Thus there were sent over to his ayde Thomas earl of\nArundell, Gilbert Umfreville earl of Angus, or earl of Kyme, sir Robert\nUmfreville, sir John Oldcastle, lord Cobham, sir John Grey and William\nPorter, with twelve hundred archers,\u2019 &c. &c.\n\n[74] According to the catalogue in Moreri, Arnauld de Corbie, lord of\nJoigny, was at this time chancellor.\n\n[75] Called William Porter by Stowe.\n\n[76] Q. If this is not _Umfreville_ earl of Angus and _Kyme_ (as Stowe\ncalls him)? There was at this period no Neville earl of Kent. The\nonly earl of Kent of that family was William Nevil lord Falconbridge,\ncreated 1461. I find this conjecture somewhat confirmed by the\noriginal, which is, \u2018Ousieville comte de Kam.\u2019 It is true, that\nHolinshed mentions the earls of Pembroke and of _Kent_ as being of the\nexpedition: but he cites Monstrelet as his authority, and is therefore\nlikely to be mistaken.\n\n[77] \u2018Que _\u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s_ elle _ne_ mourast de deuil.\u2019 \u2018That she was\nwithin a little of dying with grief.\u2019 Mary of Berry, daughter of John\nduke of Berry, and wife to John duke of Bourbon (her third husband, she\nhaving been before twice a widow, first of Louis de Ch\u00e2tillon count\nof Dunois, and, secondly, of the constable d\u2019Eu), lived till the year\n1434, when she died at Lyons. See Morery. Her children by the duke of\nBourbon were Charles, duke of Bourbon after his father,--Louis, who\ndied young,--and another Louis, founder of the line of Montpensier.\n\n[78] John II. lord of Rieux and Rochefort. According to Morery\u2019s\ncatalogue, two mareschals were created this year,--Louis lord of\nLoigny, and James lord of Heilly, commonly called Mareschal of\nAcquitaine.\n\n[79] See p. 328.\n\n\n[Transcriber's Note:\n\nInconsistent spelling and hyphenation are as in the original.\n\nSeven instances of \u201cPier-vves\u201d changed to read \u201cPier-Yves\u201d; and one\ninstance of \u201cPierre-vves\u201d changed to read \u201cPierre-Yves.\u201d]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Chronicles of Enguerrand de\nMonstrelet, Volume 2 (of 13), by Enguerrand de Monstrelet\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK CHRONICLES--ENGUERRAND MONSTRELET, VOL 2 ***\n\n***** This file should be named 52607-0.txt or 52607-0.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/5/2/6/0/52607/\n\nProduced by Wayne Hammond and The Online Distributed\nProofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net (This file was\nproduced from images generously made available by The\nInternet Archive)\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will\nbe renamed.\n\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United\nStates without permission and without paying copyright\nroyalties.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.

General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\nfreely shared with anyone.

I.\n\n    THE CONCLUSION OF THE DUCHESS OF ORLEANS\u2019 ADVOCATE AGAINST THE\n    DUKE OF BURGUNDY, AND THE REPLY FROM THE CHANCELLOR.\n\n\nThe chancellor of France, in the king\u2019s name, ordered the duchess\u2019s\nadvocate, master William Cousinot, to draw up such conclusions as\nshould be satisfactory to the duchess and her son, the duke of Orleans.\nThe advocate, after many excuses, began by showing how pitiable their\nstate was, and took for his theme part of the 7th chapter of the gospel\nof St Luke, \u2018H\u00e6c vidua erat quam cum vidisset Dominus misericordia\nmotus est super eam.\u2019\n\n\u2018Most noble prince, when our Lord entered a city called Nain, he met\nthe corpse of a young man, which his friends were carrying to the\ngrave; and when he noticed that the mother of the young man was a\nwidow, he was on this account moved with compassion toward her, and\nrestored her son to life. I may most truly apply these words to my\nlady of Orleans, for she is a widow who bewails the death of her lord\nand husband, and our lord will have compassion on her; for the king\nis our lord, in respect of terrestrial jurisdiction; and not only the\nking, but thou, lord of Acquitaine, and all other princes of this world\nhaving territorial powers, seeing my lady of Orleans thus disconsolate,\nought to feel compassion for her, and give her aid and support in\nprocuring strict justice to be done for the cruel death of her husband.\n\n\u2018In every case, and at all times, full justice should be administered\nto all; for, according to the words of the Psalmist, it is a good and\nmeritorious act,--\u2018Beati qui custodiunt judicium et faciunt justitiam\nin omni tempore.\u2019 Psalm cv.\n\n\u2018But justice should always be more rigorously observed in regard\nto widows and orphans, who have been deprived of their fathers or\nhusbands, than in any other case; for the divine, canon and civil\nlaws urge the necessity of succouring the widow and orphan. We have\nthe first instance of this in the 22d chapter of Jeremiah,--\u2018Facite\njudicium et justitiam, et liberate vi oppressum de manu calumniatoris,\npupillum et viduam,\u2019 &c.\n\n\u2018In regard to the canon law, the decrees declare, that it is very\nproper for kings to do justice and execute judgment, and deliver from\nthe hands of the oppressors widows and orphans who are injuriously used\nby them.\n\n\u2018As for the civil law, it is very clear, that widows and orphans are\nparticularly privileged in many cases, as may be seen in different law\nwritings.\n\n\u2018My lady of Orleans has lost her husband: her children have lost their\nfather, certainly one of the handsomest and most accomplished princes\nin Christendom. But let us see how they have lost him: had he been\ntaken from them by a natural death, their case would not have been so\nmuch to be pitied; but he is cut off violently in the flower of his\nyouth. In truth, this is such an outrage that every law and customary\nproceeding should bend in their favour against the malignant author of\nthe deed.\n\n\u2018In the first place, our king and sovereign lord is bounden\nparticularly by the commands of God, to whom he cannot be disobedient\nwithout sinning, to execute judgment, according to the words of\nJeremiah in the chapter before mentioned,--\u2018In memetipso juravi, dicit\nDominus, quia in solitudine erit domus vestra.\u2019 And this is conformable\nto the reply made by St Remy to king Clovis when he baptised him. The\nking asked him how long the kingdom of France would endure. The saint\nanswered, that it would last so long as justice should reign there. The\nconverse of which is, that when justice shall cease to be administered,\nthe kingdom will fall. To the king therefore may be applied what is\nwritten in the canon law, \u2018Quod justitia est illud quod suum firmat\nimperium.\u2019\n\n\u2018O, duke of Acquitaine! thou art he who, after the king, art bound\nto do justice according to the words of the Psalmist, \u2018Deus judicium\ntuum regi da et justitiam tuam filio regis.\u2019 Thou art the eldest son\nto the king, to whom, by the grace of God, thou wilt succeed, and be\nour lord: attend to our case for the love of God, for to thee more\nparticularly does it belong; and if thou dost not lay thy hand on it,\nwhen thou shalt come to reign, thou mayest find thy kingdom desolate\nand destroyed,--for each will in his turn seize parts of it, and be the\nmaster, should this atrocious crime remain unpunished.\n\n\u2018Ye also, my lords, princes, dukes and counts of the royal blood,\nrelations of the late duke, and ye other nobles, who have an affection\nfor the king\u2019s crown and honour, what ought to be your conduct on\nthis occasion? Why, certainly, if the king will not interfere in this\nmatter, ye ought to take up the business and execute judgment; for ye\nare bound by oath to guard and defend the king\u2019s honour against all who\nmay infringe upon it. This ye have done in former times, through God\u2019s\ngrace, and for which this kingdom has gained greater glory than any\nother realm in Christendom: insomuch that the English, the Germans, and\nother foreigners, have come hither to seek for justice.\n\n\u2018My lords, for the love of God, let your loyalty burst forth, according\nto your oaths, in behalf of my lady of Orleans, as she has the fullest\nconfidence it will; for, after God and the king, you are her only\nrefuge. Let no one fear to do justice, from the scandal or persecution\nthat may ensue, for it is a maxim of law, \u2018Utilius est scandalum nasci\nac permitti, quam ut veritas relinquatur,\u2019--although it were certain\nthe doing justice in this case would cause much grievous persecution\nto ensue. Yet for all this justice should not be neglected; for in\nthat case you would be indeed reproachable, if, through fear of the\noffender, you shall not dare to decree justice. On no occasion should\njustice be neglected: therefore, my lords, act according to what the\nprophet says, \u2018Viriliter agite, et confortetur cor vestrum et sustinete\nDominum.\u2019\n\n\u2018In truth, if ye do not act with courage, for one inconvenience that\nmay happen, by executing judgment, one hundred would ensue from default\nof justice. Therefore, my lords, do not hesitate to do justice to my\nlady of Orleans and her children from any dread of inconveniences\nthat may happen, but follow the dictates of our Lord,--\u2018Judicare\npupillo et humili ut non apponat magnificare se homo super terram.\u2019\nLet the punishment be so exemplary that none other may henceforth\ncommit so great or so disgraceful a crime, and that it may be held\nin perpetual memory and abhorrence. This is the object of my lady of\nOrleans and her children, namely, that the crime may be atoned for as\nheavily as possible in this world. In order that this atonement may\nbe made, my lady of Orleans and her children would willingly take the\nlegal steps for the infliction of capital punishment, if this could\nregularly be done; but as these steps, according to the customary\nusage of France, belong to the king\u2019s attorney-general alone, they\npropose that the offender shall be punished in manner following,--that\nis to say, by sentence of the king and of the court, be it ordered\nthat our adversary, the duke of Burgundy, be brought to the castle of\nthe Louvre, or elsewhere, according to the king\u2019s pleasure and that\nof my clients, and there, in the presence of the king, of my lord of\nAcquitaine, and the other princes of the blood, as well as of the\ncouncil and people, the duke of Burgundy, without hood or girdle,\nshall, on his knees, publicly confess, with a loud voice, before my\nlady of Orleans, her children, and as many other persons as she may\nplease, that maliciously and treacherously he has had my lord of\nOrleans assassinated, through hatred, envy and ambition, and for no\nother cause, notwithstanding all the charges made against him, and\nother imputations thrown on his character, to justify and exculpate\nhimself from so base a deed; and shall demand pardon from my lady of\nOrleans and her children, most humbly supplicating them to forgive his\noffences, declaring that he knows of nothing prejudicial to the honour\nand reputation of the said duke of Orleans deceased, and recals all he\nmay have said or published to the contrary.\n\n\u2018In this state he shall be carried to the court of the palace, and to\nthe h\u00f4tel de Saint Pol, the residence of the king, and to the spot\nwhere the murder was committed, and there, on high stages erected for\nthe purpose, he shall repeat the above words before such commissioners\nas my lady of Orleans and her son may please to appoint. He shall\nremain on his knees, at the last place, until priests nominated for\nthe purpose shall have recited the seven penitential psalms, said the\nlitany, and the other parts of the burial service, for the soul of the\ndeceased, after which he shall kiss the earth, and ask pardon of God,\nof my lady of Orleans, and of her children, for the offences he has\ncommitted against them.\n\n\u2018The manner and form of this recantation, and begging pardon, shall be\nwritten out, and copies sent to all the different towns in the kingdom\nwith orders for the magistrates to have them proclaimed by sound of\ntrumpet, that it may be notorious to all within and without the realm.\n\n\u2018And as additional reparations for such offences, and that they may\nremain in perpetual remembrance, all the houses belonging to the duke\nof Burgundy in Paris shall be razed to the ground, and remain in ruins\nfor ever. On the places where any of his houses shall have stood, there\nshall be erected handsome crosses of stone, having large and strong\ntablets, on which shall be written a full account of the murder of my\nlate lord, the duke of Orleans, and the cause of these houses being\ndestroyed.\n\n\u2018On the spot where my late lord was murdered shall be erected a similar\ncross; and the house wherein the murderers hid themselves shall be\npulled down. This spot, and the adjoining houses, the duke of Burgundy\nshall be forced to purchase, and to build thereon a handsome college\nfor six canons, six vicars, and six chaplains, whose nominations shall\nremain with my lady of Orleans and her heirs. In this college six\nmasses shall be said every day for the soul of the deceased duke of\nOrleans, and high mass at the usual time of canonical hours. For the\nsupport of this college there shall be a mortmain rent of one thousand\nlivres parisis; and the whole shall be well furnished with dresses,\nbooks, chalices, ornaments, and all other necessaries, at the sole\nexpense of the duke of Burgundy; and over the entrance shall be written\nin large letters the cause of its foundation.\n\n\u2018The duke of Burgundy shall, beside, be constrained to found a college\nfor the salvation of the soul of the deceased, in the town of Orleans,\nconsisting of twelve canons, twelve vicars, and twelve clerks, which\ncollege shall bear the name of the defunct; and the nominations to\nit shall belong to my lady of Orleans, and to the heirs of the late\nduke of Orleans. It shall be situated in whatever part of the late\nduke\u2019s possessions in Orleans the duchess shall please, and shall be\nhandsomely constructed, furnished with books and all other necessaries,\nwith an income of two thousand livres parisis; and a similar\ninscription to the one before mentioned shall be placed over the gate.\n\n\u2018For the greater perpetuity of this event, and that it may be made\nknown to all foreign nations, the duke of Burgundy shall be enjoined to\nerect two chapels; the one near the holy sepulchre at Jerusalem, and\nthe other at Rome, and assign to each the annual value of one hundred\nlivres in the coin of those countries, and to provide them with all\nnecessary furniture. In each of these chapels shall a daily mass be\nsaid for the soul of the deceased, and over the doors shall be placed\nthe same inscriptions as over the colleges.\n\n\u2018The duke of Burgundy shall also be constrained to pay the sum of\none million in gold, not to the profit of my lady of Orleans or her\nchildren, but to found and endow hospitals and monasteries, and to\ndistribute in alms and other works of piety for the salvation of the\nsoul of the defunct.\n\n\u2018That this sentence may be carried into due effect, all the lands\nwhich the duke of Burgundy possesses in this kingdom shall be placed\nin the hands of the king, that they may be sold for the accomplishment\nof the above works. The duke of Burgundy shall also be condemned to\nclose imprisonment in whatever place it may please the king, until\nthe above sentence be carried into execution. After which, he shall\nbe banished for ever beyond sea, or at least for the space of twenty\nyears, to bewail and repent of his crime, or until it shall be thought\nhe may have sufficiently done it. On his return, he shall be ordered,\nunder severe penalties, never to approach within one hundred leagues of\nthe queen or the children of the late duke of Orleans, without being\ncondemned to such heavy damages, and other penalties suited to the\nenormity of the case, as shall be held in perpetual remembrance. He\nshall also be condemned to pay whatever costs my lady of Orleans and\nher children may have occurred on this present occasion.\n\n\u2018I say, therefore, that such ought to be the judgment given for them,\nand without delay, considering the notoriety and enormity of the\noffence of our adversary; for it is publicly known, that the duke of\nBurgundy has confessed himself guilty of it. He first made a confession\nof his guilt to my lord of Berry and to the king of Sicily, giving no\nreason for it but that he was urged on by the devil: he then did the\nsame before several noblemen. This ought therefore to weigh against\nhim, and convict him of the crime, without further trial: nor ought\nyou to suffer any sort of colouring to be admitted in palliation of\nhis guilt. He ought not to be heard otherwise than he has been, for\nhe varied not in his confessions to the different persons; and pope\nInnocent approves of this, in his chapter on Free Will, and Guillermus\nde Montleon, in his chapter on Clerical Constitutions. Pope Nicholas\nheld king Lothaire, in like manner, convicted to his prejudice in a\ncertain case, about which he had written to the pope, as appears in\nthe above chapter. This confession of king Lothaire had been made in\na letter, previously to any trial. The duke of Burgundy, therefore,\nought to be condemned from this public confession of his crime in the\npresence of different persons. He has beside made a similar confession\nwhen he appeared publicly before thee, lord of Acquitaine, when thou\ndidst sit in judgment representing the person of the king, and before\nthe princes of the blood and all the council of state. He cannot,\ntherefore, deny his having made such confession before competent\njudges. It follows then, that no further trial is necessary, but that\nsentence should immediately be passed; for confession of guilt should\nbe judged the fullest evidence.\n\n\u2018The law says, \u2018In confitentem null\u00e6 sunt partes judicantis.\u2019 And\nsupposing, that according to some, a sentence is requisite, at least\nit is certain that no trial or examination of the cause is necessary,\nsince this present case is extremely notorious. So has it formerly been\ndetermined by the sentence and judgment of the kings in times past,\nagainst several great lords of their day,--to wit, that when the facts\nwere notorious, no other process or inquisition was required. And so\nshall it be determined, by the grace of God, in the present case,--for\nso reason demands.\n\n\u2018Should it, however, be thought necessary to go into another trial,\nwhich, from all I have said, I cannot suppose, my lady of Orleans\nis ready prepared to bring forward the fullest proof of what I have\nadvanced, and such as must convince all reasonable persons. But as my\nlady can now only offer civil conclusions, and would willingly propose\ncriminal ones, but that it belongs to the king\u2019s attorney-general\naccording to the usage in France,--my lady, therefore, most earnestly\nsupplicates the king\u2019s attorney to join with her, and propose such\nsentence as the law in this case requires.\u2019\n\nThese were the conclusions of my lady of Orleans and her sons,--after\nwhich, the council of the princes of the blood, and others of the\nking\u2019s council, with the approbation of the duke of Acquitaine, made\nthe chancellor reply to the duchess of Orleans, that the duke of\nAcquitaine, as lieutenant for the king, and representing his person,\nand the princes of the blood-royal were well satisfied with her\nconduct respecting her late lord the duke of Orleans: that they held\nhim perfectly exculpated from all the charges that had been brought\nagainst him; and that, in regard to her requests, speedy and good\njustice should be done her, so that she should be reasonably contented\ntherewith.\n\nA few days after, the young duke of Orleans, Charles, did homage for\nthe duchy of Orleans, and all his other possessions, to his uncle\nCharles king of France: then, taking leave of the queen and dauphin,\nand the princes of the blood who were in Paris, he departed with his\nmen at arms for Blois, whence he had come. The duchess-dowager of\nOrleans remained in Paris.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. II.\n\n    GUYE DE ROVE, ARCHBISHOP OF RHEIMS, APPEALS FROM THE\n    CONSTITUTIONS DRAWN UP BY THE UNIVERSITY OF PARIS, WHICH ANGERS\n    THAT BODY, AND THEY IMPRISON HIS COMMISSARY.\n\n\nAt this period, Guy de Roye[1], archbishop of Rheims, who had been\nsummoned specially by the king to attend the meeting of the prelates at\nParis, assembled to consider on the means of uniting the whole church,\nneither came himself nor sent any one in his behalf. He refused to\nagree to the decisions of this council, and sent a chaplain as his\ncommissary, with letters signed with his name and seal, to confirm his\nopposition to all the statutes they had drawn up, as well for himself\nand his diocese as for all his subjects within the province.\n\nThe king and the clergy were much displeased at this conduct; and the\nuniversity of Paris requested that the commissary should be confined in\nclose imprisonment, where he remained for a long time.\n\nThe cardinal of Bordeaux came at this time to Paris, partly for the\nunion of the church; and then also returned thither master Peter Paoul,\nand the patriarch of Alexandria, named master Symon Cramant, who\nhad been sent by the king of France and the university of Paris, as\nambassadors to the two rival popes.\n\nThe assembled prelates were very anxious for their arrival, that they\nmight be better acquainted with the business they had to manage, and on\nwhat grounds they should proceed. Master Peter Paoul frequently rode\nthrough the streets of Paris in his doctor\u2019s dress, accompanied by the\ncardinal riding on one side of his horse as women do. In the presence\nof this cardinal and doctor, the abbot of Caudebec, of the order of\nCistercians, and doctor in theology, proposed, on the part of the\nuniversity, an union of the church. The abbot of St Denis, with other\ndoctors in theology, declared for an union of the universal church;\nand, shortly after, the cardinal departed from Paris for Boulogne, and\nthence went to Calais.\n\nThe abbot of St Denis and another doctor of theology, who had been, by\nthe king\u2019s orders, confined in the prison of the Louvre, were released,\nat the request of the cardinal de Bar, and set at liberty, contrary to\nthe will of the university of Paris. In like manner did the bishop of\nCambray, master Peter d\u2019Ailly, an excellent doctor of theology, gain\nhis liberty. He had been confined at the instance of the university,\nbecause he was not favourable to their sentiments, and was delivered\nat the entreaties of count Waleran de St Pol, and the great council of\nthe king. All Christendom was now divided in religious opinions, as\nto the head of the church, by the contentions of the two rival popes,\nwho could not be brought to agree on the means to put an end to this\ndisgraceful schism.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. III.\n\n    THE DUKE OF BURGUNDY ASSEMBLES A LARGE BODY OF MEN AT ARMS TO\n    SUCCOUR JOHN OF BAVARIA AGAINST THE LIEGEOIS, AND COMBATS THEM.\n\n\nAbout this time, John duke of Burgundy was busily employed in\ncollecting a body of men at arms to aid his brother-in-law, the bishop\nof Liege, whom, as has been said, the Liegeois had driven out of their\ncountry, and besieged in the town of Maestricht. He sent for succour\namong his friends and allies, namely, to Burgundy, Flanders, Artois,\nand the borders of Picardy, whence came very many, and several from\nSavoy.\n\nThe earl of Mar, also, a Scotsman, then at Bruges, with about four\nscore combatants, ready to embark for Scotland, advanced into the\nTournesis, whither the duke came, and had a conference with their\nprincipal captains in the town of Tournay.\n\nOn the eleventh day of September, he marched thence with a\nnumerous body of men at arms, and a great train of artillery and\nbaggage-waggons to Enghien, where he was gladly received by the lord\nof the place. On the morrow, he advanced to Nivelle in Brabant, within\na league of Salmes. He marched next to Flourines, where he met sir\nRichard[2] Daulphin, sir William de Tignonville, lately provost of\nParis, and master William Bouratier, one of the king\u2019s secretaries,\nambassadors to him from the king of France. Having obtained an\naudience, they said they had been sent to him from the king and the\ngreat council on two objects; first, to know whether the Liegeois and\ntheir bishop were willing to submit their differences to the king and\nthe great council; secondly, to inform him of the suit urged against\nhim by the duchess-dowager of Orleans and her children, for the death\nof the late duke of Orleans, his brother, of the replies they had made\nto the charges he had brought against the late duke, and that they\ndemanded instant justice on him the duke of Burgundy, and that neither\nlaw nor reason ought to prevent sentence being passed by the king\naccording to the conclusions that had been drawn up against him.\n\nThe duke of Burgundy shortly answered, that in regard to the first\npoint, he was willing, as was right for him to do, to obey the king\u2019s\norders, but that his brother-in-law, John of Bavaria, who had married\nhis sister, had most earnestly solicited his assistance against the\ncommonalty and his subjects of Liege, who had rebelled, and even held\nhim besieged. Similar requests had been made to duke William, count\nof Hainault, his brother in law, and also brother-in-law to John of\nBavaria: wherefore the armaments could not now be broken up, since\nduring the time the ambassadors would be negotiating between the two\nparties, John of Bavaria, their bishop and lord, might be in great\ndanger from his rebellious subjects, and their success might serve for\nan example and inducement for other subjects to resist their lords, and\ngive rise to an universal rebellion. He added, that the king and his\ncouncil might, without any prejudice to themselves, have refrained from\nso readily listening to such requests, as none of the aforesaid parties\nwere subjects to the kingdom of France.\n\nIn regard to the second point, he, John duke of Burgundy, made answer,\nthat instantly on his return from this expedition he would wait on\nthe king of France, and act towards him, and all others, in a manner\nbecoming a good subject, and the near relationship in which he stood to\nthe king.\n\nThe ambassadors, finding they could not obtain more satisfactory\nanswers to the points on which they were sent, were obliged to be\ncontented. They resolved, however, to wait the event of this expedition\nagainst the Liegeois; and during that time there came to the duke\nof Burgundy, from the country of Hainault, his brother-in-law duke\nWilliam, accompanied by the counts de Conversan, de Namur, and de\nSalines, in Ardennes, with many notable lords, as well knights as\nesquires, from Hainault, Holland, Zealand, Ostrevant, and other\nplaces, to the number of twelve hundred helmets[3], or thereabout, and\ntwo thousand infantry well equipped, with from five to six hundred\ncarriages laden with provision and military stores.\n\nMany councils were held at Flourines, and in that neighbourhood, as\nto their future conduct, and whither they might march their army\nwith the greatest probability of success. It was determined that duke\nWilliam should command the van, and, as he advanced, destroy the whole\ncountry with fire and sword; that the duke of Burgundy, with the earl\nof Mar and the main body, should direct their march along the causeway\nof Branchaut, which leads strait to Tongres and Maestricht. In the\nlast place, the lord de Pier-Yves[4] and the Liegeois had, as has been\nbefore said, besieged their bishop and lord, John of Bavaria.\n\nIn consequence of this resolution, the two dukes began their march\nby different roads, and destroyed all the country on the Tuesday,\nWednesday and Thursday, and met on the Saturday evening, about vespers,\nin the town of Montenach, situated on the above causeway. In this\nplace and neighbourhood was the whole army lodged, forming but one\nbody; and two marshals were appointed to command and find quarters for\nit;--on the part of the duke of Burgundy, the lord de Vergy[5],--and\non that of duke William, the lord de Jeumont. They had under their\nimmediate orders five hundred helmets, seven hundred cross-bows, and\nfifteen hundred archers, all men of tried courage, with sixteen hundred\ncarriages, as well carts as waggons, laden with arms, ammunition and\nprovision, and all other necessaries for such an expedition.\n\nOn this Saturday, the lord de Pier-Yves, and his son the newly-elected\nbishop of Liege, as they were besieging Maestricht, learnt from their\nspies, that the two before-mentioned dukes were rapidly advancing\nagainst them, and burning the country on their line of march. They\ninstantly raised the siege, and retreated to the city of Liege with\nfull forty thousand combatants, where they fixed their quarters, Liege\nbeing only five leagues distant from Maestricht. The commanders there\nheld a council, with such of the inhabitants as had not been at the\nsiege; and at its close it was proclaimed through different parts of\nthe town, by orders of the governor and his son, the bishop, that every\nman capable of bearing arms should, on the morrow-morning, at the sound\nof a bell, be ready equipped to follow their commanders out of the town\nwhithersoever they might lead them.\n\nIn consequence of this order, on the morrow, the 22d day of September\n1408, there issued out of Liege, according to computation, about fifty\nthousand armed men. In this number were from five to six hundred well\narmed, in the french manner, on horseback, and from one hundred to six\nscore english archers, in their pay. They were followed by infinite\nnumbers of carts and other carriages, and a mob of people dressed in\nvarious manners, according to their own fancies.\n\nThe bell tolled at break of day, and they then sallied forth in good\narray, following their governor and bishop, very eager to offer combat\nto the enemy. Their governor had frequently warned them of the dangers\nthat might ensue from a battle, as their enemies were, for the greater\npart, nobles or gentlemen accustomed to war and obedience to their\ncommanders, which was not the case with them; and that it would be more\nto their advantage to remain within well-inclosed towns and castles\nharrassing the enemy by various means, and so tiring him out that he\nshould be forced to quit their country.\n\nThis advice, however, was not agreeable to the Liegeois, for it seemed\nto them that their numbers were so great that the enemy could not\nresist them; and they were not well pleased with what their governor\nhad told them. The governor, perceiving the Liegeois determined on\nbattle, led them into the plain, and drew them up in handsome array. He\nfrequently exhorted them to behave themselves valiantly, and with one\naccord, this day against the enemy, who was marching to attack them,\nand to defend with courage their lives and liberties.\n\nThey marched near to Tongres, which is five leagues distant from Liege,\nwhither the two dukes had advanced on the Saturday; for they had\nalready heard the siege of Maestricht was broken up, and that the men\nof Liege were intending to offer them battle. After some councils had\nbeen holden with the captains and the most experienced in their army,\nthey sent off, very early on the Sunday morning, two hundred light\ntroops, under the command of Robert le Roux and some other noblemen\nof the country, to inquire into the truth of what they had heard, and\nto see what the enemy was about. They shortly returned, and told the\ndukes, that the intelligence they had received was true, for that they\nhad seen the Liegeois in great numbers marching in battle-array. The\ndukes, on hearing this, commanded their men to arm, and to draw up in\norder of battle. When this was done, they marched to meet the Liegeois,\nand scarcely had they advanced half a league when they appeared in\nsight.\n\nThe Liegeois also saw them, for they were near to Tongres. Both armies\nadvancing, the dukes then posted themselves and all their infantry\non a very advantageous spot; and thinking the enemy would attempt to\ndislodge them, they formed their army into one battalion, the better to\nsupport the attack, and placed their baggage in their rear. They posted\nthe greater part of their archers and cross-bows on their right and\nleft as wings. The lord de Miraumont this day commanded the archers, by\norders of the duke of Burgundy, and with great credit to himself. The\nduke of Burgundy was on the right, and duke William on the left of the\narmy, each attended by his own people.\n\nAfter the proper orders had been given, and every arrangement made\naccording to the advice of the most experienced officers, very many\nnew knights were created. The men of Liege, swelled with pride, and\narrogantly considering the army of their opponents as infinitely\ninferior to them, marched on the right for an eminence called the\nheights of Hasbane, where they halted in handsome array. They had with\nthem the standard of St Lambert, and those of their different guilds;\nand the reason why they had halted on this spot was, that some of their\nold men had told them that it was there their ancestors had gained a\nvictory, and they flattered themselves with similar success.\n\nThey then formed their army in handsome order, and played off many\ncannons against their enemies, which annoyed them very much. It should\nbe known, that between the two armies was a narrow valley, at the\nbottom of which was a ditch to carry off the water in times of rain.\n\nThe two dukes having with their army remained stationary, observing\nthat the Liegeois did not seem inclined to quit their position, and\nbegin the battle, held a short council with their ablest officers,\nand thinking success was more likely to follow the most courageous,\ndetermined to advance slowly toward them in battle-array, on account of\nthe weight of their arms, and attack them where they were, before they\ncould fortify themselves, or increase their numbers by reinforcements.\n\nIn consequence, five hundred men at arms, on horseback, were ordered to\nattack the army of Liege on its rear, and about a thousand infantry,\nunder the command of the lords de Croy, de Helly, de Neufville and de\nRaise, knights, with Enguerrand de Bournouville, esquire, on the part\nof the duke of Burgundy; and by the lords de Hamette and de Ligne,\nknights, with Robert le Roux, esquire, who instantly advanced into the\nplain according to their orders.\n\nThe Liegeois, observing so large a detachment quit the duke\u2019s army,\nand march away, as it were, thought they were running off from fear\nof their great numbers, and began shouting, in their language, \u2018Fuyo,\nfuyo!\u2019 and repeating this word many times. The lord de Pier-Yves, the\ngovernor, like an able man, well versed in war, frequently, but gently,\nchecked them for making this noise, saying, \u2018My very dear friends,\nthat troop on horseback which you see, are not running away, as you\nsuppose; but when that other body of infantry, much greater, as you\nmay observe, shall be advanced near enough to begin the attack, those\non horseback will instantly wheel about, like skilful soldiers, and\ncharge your rear, with a design to divide your army, while the others\nshall attack you in front. Notwithstanding we have every appearance\nof a successful issue to our battle, I have always advised you to the\ncontrary; and though your hearts are set upon it, as if already sure\nof victory, I remain still in the same opinion,--because you are not\nso well used to warfare, nor armed like to your adversaries, who have\nlearnt all military exercises from their childhood. This was the reason\nwhy I proposed avoiding a battle; for it would have been more to your\nadvantage to have defended your towns and fortresses, and whenever a\nfavourable opportunity offered, to have fallen on your enemies, so that\nthey would have been forced to have quitted your country. However, the\nday you have so ardently wished for is now come; and I beg of you to\nput your hopes in God, and boldly and steadily exert yourselves in the\ndefence of your country against the enemy now marching to attack you.\u2019\n\nHaving finished this speech, he wanted to mount some of his most\ndetermined men on horseback to oppose the detachment then on the\nplain; but in truth the commonalty would not suffer it to be done, and\nuttered against him many reproaches, calling him a traitor.\n\nHe patiently suffered their rude ignorance, and hastily commanded the\narmy to be formed into a square, in the front of which was a body drawn\nup in the form of a triangle,--and the carts and baggage were towards\nthe rear, on the right and left of his army, handsomely arranged: their\nhorses were in the rear, on one of the wings, intermixed with their\narchers and cross-bows,--but they were of little value, except the\nenglish archers, who were better disposed of in other places.\n\nThe lord de Pier-Yves, accompanied by his son the bishop and some of\nhis best companions in arms, like a good commander, posted himself at\nthe head of his army, fronting the enemy.\n\nDuring this time, the two dukes began their march, gaily exhorting\ntheir men to behave themselves gallantly against the enemy, a rude\nand ignorant people, who had rebelled against their lord, and who\nconfidently trusted in their superior numbers for success,--telling\ntheir men, that if they acted as they expected they would, victory\nwould infallibly be theirs, and they would gain everlasting honour.\n\nWhen the dukes had made such like speeches, they retired to their\nposts, and under their banners, and advanced slowly toward the enemy,\nwho kept up a heavy fire against them with their cannons.\n\nThe banner-bearer of the duke of Burgundy was a very valiant knight,\ncalled sir James de Courtjambe, who, accidentally falling on his knees\nas he marched, alarmed many, who thought it was an unfavourable omen\nof their success; but he was soon raised by the help of those of his\nguard, and behaved himself honourably the whole day. This knight was a\nnative of Burgundy. The banner of duke William was that day borne by\na gallant knight, called sir Hoste d\u2019Escaussines, who behaved himself\nright well.\n\nWhen the two armies met, the conflict became very severe on each side,\nand lasted for upwards of an hour, when many deadly blows were given\nby both parties. At this moment, the detachment on horseback, with\nthe infantry, according to their orders, advanced to the rear of the\nLiegeois; but from the position of their baggage-waggons, they had\nmuch difficulty to force their way. At length, by dint of courage, they\nsucceeded, and, having gained an entrance, began to lay about them so\nvigorously that the army of the enemy was divided,--and they saw full\nsix thousand Liegeois quit their ranks, with their guns and the banners\nof their guilds, and take flight with all speed towards a village half\na league from the field of battle.\n\nWhen the detachment perceived this, they left off the attack they had\nbegun, and pursued the runaways, whom they charged, not once, but\nseveral times, beating down and slaying them without mercy,--and, in\nshort, routed them so effectually that, through fear of death, they\nfled here and there, into woods and other places, to hide themselves.\n\nThis party of the Liegeois being either killed, dispersed, or taken\nprisoners, the horsemen returned to their main body, gallantly fighting\nthe enemy, who, it must be said, defended themselves courageously. In\ntruth, the event of this battle was some time doubtful,--for, during\none half hour, it could not be known which side would be victorious.\nThe noise of their war-cries was frightful:--the Burgundians and\nHainaulters shouted under their banners, \u2018Our Lady for Burgundy! Our\nLady for Hainault!\u2019 and the Liegeois, in their turn, shouted, \u2018St\nLambert for Pier-Yves!\u2019\n\nThe men of Liege would perhaps have conquered, if this detachment on\nhorseback, when returned from the defeat of the runaways, had not again\nfallen on their rear, and behaved so marvellously well that those who\nopposed them were pierced through, and all attempts to check them were\nvain. A great slaughter was made by them in a short time, for none were\nadmitted to ransom; and by their vigour whole ranks fell one over the\nother, for now all the weight and power of the infantry were brought\nagainst them.\n\nThe defeat once begun, there were such heaps of dead and wounded that\nit was melancholy to behold, for they were thicker in many places than\nstooks of corn in harvest. This ought not to occasion surprise; for\nwhen the common people are assembled, badly armed, and puffed up with\ntheir extravagant desires, although they be in great numbers, yet shall\nthey hardly be able to resist an army composed of noblemen well tried\nin arms, even when God shall permit it so to be. At this period of\nthe battle, and near to the banner of the duke of Burgundy, where the\nconflict was the strongest, fell the lord de Pierre-Yves and his two\nsons,--namely, the one who had been elected bishop of Liege and his\nbrother: they were instantly put to death.\n\nThe heir of Salmes[6], who bore the standard of St Lambert, namely,\nthe eldest son to the count de Salmes[6], who was in the army of the\ntwo dukes; sir John Collet, and many other knights and esquires to\nthe amount of upwards of five hundred; all the english archers, and\nabout twenty-eight thousand of the commonalty, were left dead on the\nfield,--and more perished by arrow-shots than by any other weapon.\n\nSir Baldwin de Montgardin, knight, to save his life, surrendered\nhimself to the duke of Burgundy:--he was led out of the engagement, and\nafterward given by the duke to sir Wicart de Bours.\n\nI have no need to particularise the great courage and coolness of the\nduke of Burgundy, nor how he galloped to different parts of the army,\nexhorting them to act well,--nor how, until the end of the battle,\nhe most gallantly behaved himself,--for in truth, his conduct was\nsuch that he was praised and spoken of by all knights and others;\nand although he was frequently covered with arrows and other missile\nweapons, he did not on that day lose one drop of blood.\n\nWhen he was asked after the defeat, if they should cease from slaying\nthe Liegeois, he replied, \u2018Let them all die together! for I will not\nthat any prisoners be made, nor that any be ransomed!!\u2019\n\nIn the like gallant manner did duke William, the other princes, and in\ngeneral the whole body of the chivalry and nobility of the two dukes\nbehave themselves. There were slain from five to six hundred of their\nmen; and among the number were, John de la Chapelle, knight to the\nabove duke,--sir Flourimont de Brimeu, John de la Trimouille, who on\nthis day had been made a knight,--Hugotin de Nambon, John de Theune,\nviscount de Brimequet, a native of Hainault,--Rollant de la Mote, and\nothers, to the amount of one hundred and six score gentlemen: the rest\nwere varlets[7].\n\nJust as the dukes had gained the victory, about two thousand men made\na sally from Tongres, to assist the Liegemen. When they saw they were\ndefeated, they retreated to their town, but were so closely pursued by\nthe body of horse that had done such essential service that very many\nof them were killed.\n\nThe two dukes, seeing their victory was now complete, met, and returned\nthanks to the Creator, congratulating with one another for their\nsuccess. They had tents pitched on the field of battle, and remained\nthere for three days and three nights.\n\nThe french ambassadors, having now taken their leave, departed for\nTournay, and continued their road to Paris to the king and his council;\nbut prior to their departure, the duke of Burgundy had dispatched a\nmessenger to the king of France, with letters to inform him and his\ngood friends in Paris of the fortunate event of the battle. This news\nwas not very agreeable to many who were intending to urge the king\nto prosecute the duke of Burgundy for the murder of the late duke of\nOrleans,--and on the contrary, it gave great joy to his friends.\n\nOn Monday, the morrow of the battle, about the hour of twelve, John\nof Bavaria, bishop of Liege, attended by the heir of Heinseberg, and\nseveral others, nobles and not nobles, to the number of six hundred\nhelmets, or thereabout, came from the town of Maestricht, wherein\nthey had been besieged, to the camp of the two dukes, and most humbly\nthanked them for the succour they had afforded him. He and his party\nwere received with much joy; and, on his arrival, he was presented with\nthe head of the lord de Pier-Yves, which had been found among the dead,\nwith his two sons, and was fixed to the top of a lance, that all who\npleased might see it!\n\nOn the following Tuesday, the feast of St Fremin, a martyr, the\ninhabitants of Liege, Huy, Dinant and Tongres, and of all the other\ngood towns in the bishoprick of Liege, excepting the castle of\nBouillon, hearing of the great destruction of their countrymen, and the\npower of their enemies, were panic-struck, and, seeing no probability\nof any assistance, surrendered themselves to the obedience of the dukes\nof Burgundy and of Holland. They sent to them ambassadors to this\neffect, and also to supplicate John of Bavaria, their bishop and lord,\nthat he would graciously have pity upon them, and grant them his pardon.\n\nThe bishop, through the intercession of the two dukes, complied with\ntheir request, on condition that such as had been most active in\npromoting the rebellion, many of whom were still alive, whose names\nthey would set down, should be given up to the two dukes, to do by them\nas they in their justice should think right; and each of the towns gave\nsufficient hostages for the due performance of the terms.\n\nOn the ensuing Thursday, the two dukes and the bishop, with the whole\narmy, broke up the camp, and advanced toward the town of Liege. The\nduke of Burgundy was quartered in the town of Flauye, on the river\nMeuse, one league distant from Liege, and duke William among the\nmountains.\n\nOn the following Sunday, the dukes and the bishop held a full council,\nto which all their ministers were admitted, on the present state of\naffairs. Other councils were continued until the Tuesday, when the\nbishop made his entry into Liege, and was received with great humility\nby the remnant of its inhabitants. The most culpable in the late\nrebellion had been before arrested and thrown into prison in this and\nin all the other towns.\n\nThe bishop went first to the cathedral church of St Lambert to offer\nhis prayers, and reconcile himself with the chapter: after this he went\nto his palace, when he was most humbly entreated by the people to have\nmercy on them, which he granted; and, shortly after, he returned to the\ncamp of the two dukes.\n\nAbout two o\u2019clock in the afternoon, on the morrow, the dukes and the\nbishop, with several nobles of the army, assembled on an elevated spot\nnear the camp, whither sir John de Jeumont, marshal to duke William,\nby the commands of the two dukes and the bishop, had ordered the heir\nof Rochefort, a rich nobleman, John de Saramie[8], knight, and fifteen\nother citizens, to be brought from the town, and had their heads cut\noff, one after another, by the executioner. Many churchmen, and some\nwomen, were also drowned in the Meuse for having been concerned in the\nrebellion!\n\nOn the morrow, the dukes and the bishop moved with the army to a town\nthree leagues distant, called Beaucloquet, where many conferences\nwere held, on the state of the country. The count de Nevers joined\nhis brother, the duke of Burgundy, at this place, with four hundred\ncombatants. Hither also sir John de Jeumont ordered nineteen citizens\nfrom the town of Huy to be brought, who underwent a similar punishment\nto those of Liege, and for the same cause; and, as before, many\nchurchmen and women were drowned[9].\n\nAm\u00e9 de Viry, a Savoyard, a nobleman well experienced in war, came\nhither also to aid the duke of Burgundy, and accompanied by three\nhundred helmets from that country. When the dukes and the bishop had\nfor several days consulted together on the affairs of Liege, it was at\nlength concluded, with the approbation of John of Bavaria, now surnamed\nJohn the Pitiless, that they should all meet again in the city of\nTournay, on St Luke\u2019s day next ensuing, to determine finally on the\nmeasures to be pursued touching these matters.\n\nAfter many executions had taken place in the bishoprick of Liege\non those who had been concerned in the rebellion, and when the\nfortifications of the towns of Huy, Dinant and others, had been\ndestroyed, the two dukes began their march homeward, taking with them\na number of persons from Liege, who had been given as hostages for the\nobservance of all the articles of the treaty that should be made with\nthem. Some of them were sent by duke William to Mons and Valenciennes,\nand some to Lille, Arras, and other places belonging to the duke of\nBurgundy, who went to his county of Flanders, and duke William to\nHainault, after they had disbanded their men at arms. The greater part\nreturned to their homes much enriched by the plunder of the Liegeois,\nwho, thunderstruck by the misfortune that had befallen them, became\nstupified and indolent.\n\nMany great lords attended the duke of Burgundy on this expedition:\namong them were, from Burgundy, sir John de Ch\u00e2lons[10], sir Gaultier\nde Ruples, the lord de Vergy[11], marshal of Burgundy, the lord de St\nGeorge, sir John de la Balme[12], sir William de Champ-divers, sir\nJames de Courtjambe, the lord de Montagu, and many more. From Picardy,\nthe lords de Croy[13], de Heilly, de Fosseux, de Vaurin, sir Bort\nGuieret and his brothers, the lord of Inchy, the lord of Raisse, the\nlord de Brimeu, sir Regnault de Crequy lord of Comtes[14], Enguerrand\nde Bournouville, the lord de Ront, sir Raoul de Flandres, the lord de\nPoix, sir Wincart de Bours, the lord d\u2019Auxy, the lord de Mailly, the\nlord de Thiennes and the lord d\u2019Azincourt. From Flanders, sir John and\nsir Louis de Guystelle, the lord de Hames, sir John de Bailleul, sir\nCollart de Fosseux, and others, the principal nobles of the country.\n\nIn like manner, duke William had assembled his nobles, with many\nothers, his allies; among whom was sir John de Bethune, brother to the\nviscount de Meaux. Common report said, that Anthony duke of Brabant,\nbrother to the duke of Burgundy, and Waleran de Luxembourg count\nde St Pol, had refused their assistance, because they had not been\nmade acquainted with the terms and agreements entered into by John\nof Bavaria on the one part, and the lord de Pier-Yves on the other,\nfor the resignation of the bishoprick of Liege. They also made other\nexcuses.\n\nWhen the day appointed for the meeting of the duke of Burgundy, duke\nWilliam and the bishop of Liege, in the town of Tournay, for the final\nsettlement of the affairs of Liege drew near, the inhabitants of\nthat town sent them a petition, by ambassadors chosen from among the\nprincipal citizens, to request they would fix on some other town, as\nthe numbers of their attendants would greatly harrass and impoverish\nthem, considering the very small stock of provision that was in\nTournay. Their request was granted,--and the town of Lille was chosen\nfor their meeting on the day that had before been fixed on.\n\nThither all the hostages from Liege were conducted, and brought into\nthe presence of the aforesaid dukes and bishop, with several more that\nhad been deputed to hear what judgment should be given, which was as\nfollows:\n\n\u2018The dukes of Burgundy and Holland declare, that this their judgment\nshall be punctually fulfilled in every respect, with regard to the\npresent time, reserving to themselves the power of making any future\nalterations in it as often as, and in what manner, they shall please.\n\n\u2018First, They consent that the inhabitants of Liege, of the towns and\ncountry of that bishoprick, situated within the district of Liege,\nthe country of Los, the countries of Hasbane, St Tron, the territory\nof Bouillon, shall enjoy their customary franchises and privileges.\nThey order, that the citizens of Liege, and of the other towns above\nnamed, do bring to the monastery des Escolliers, in the town of Mons\nin Hainault, on the morrow of Martinmas-day next ensuing, all the\nletters patent and charters of their laws and privileges, which they\npossess,--which they will deliver into the hands of such as may be\ncommissioned by the said dukes to receive them. Those who bring them\nshall make oath, on the salvation of their own souls, and of the souls\nof them who sent them, that they have not fraudulently left behind any\ncharters of their laws and privileges.\n\n\u2018Item, the dukes aforesaid declare, that should the city of Liege, or\nany other town, neglect to send, or fraudulently retain, any of their\ncharters, that town so retaining them shall be for ever deprived of its\nprivileges and particular laws.\n\n\u2018Item, the lords aforesaid will, that these charters and letters\npatent be delivered to the commissioners punctually on the morrow of\nMartinmas-day.\n\n\u2018Item, they likewise ordain, that when these charters and privileges\nshall have been duly examined, and new ones drawn up and delivered,\nneither the bishop of Liege nor his chapter shall grant any new\nprivileges to the inhabitants, without the consent of the two dukes or\ntheir successors.\n\n\u2018Item, they also ordain, that henceforward the commonalty shall not\nappoint or nominate, in the aforesaid towns and bishoprick, any\nofficers, such as governors, masters of trades, doctors of arts,--but\nthat from this day all such offices be annulled.\n\n\u2018Item, they ordain, that all bailiffs, provosts, mayors, and others\nbearing similar titles, shall be nominated by the bishop of Liege\nand the count de Los;--and also, that the sheriffs in such towns as\nclaim the right of shrievalty shall be renewed yearly, and a certain\nnumber appointed according to the exigency of the case and size of the\ntowns. In no large town shall father and son, two brothers-in-law, two\ncousins-german, the uncle and nephew, nor anyone who has married the\nmother of another, be appointed sheriffs at the same time, in order\nthat no improper favours be shewn from partiality of kindred. All\nofficers shall swear solemnly on their creation, to preserve and abide\nby every article and point contained in the constitution delivered to\nthem.\n\n\u2018Item, they ordain, that the bishop of Liege may, each year, at the\nexpiration of the shrievalty, appoint such sheriffs as he shall please,\nor re-appoint those of the preceding year, or others according to his\ngood pleasure, provided they are not any way connected by blood, as\nhas been before mentioned. All disputes respecting the persons or\nfortunes of the inhabitants of the different towns having sheriffs,\nshall be brought before their jurisdictions,--and at the end of the\nyear, the sheriffs shall be bound to render an account of their\nadministration before their lord, the bishop of Liege, or his deputies,\nand before one commissary deputed by the chapter, and another on the\npart of the different churches.\n\n\u2018Item, they ordain, that all guilds and fraternities in the city of\nLiege, and in all the other towns, shall henceforth cease and be\nannulled; and that the banners of the above guilds in Liege shall be\ndelivered up to commissaries, on an appointed day that shall be made\nknown to them; and the banners of the other towns shall be brought\nby the inhabitants to a certain place on an appointed day, to the\ncommissioners named to receive them, and who shall do with them as they\nmay judge expedient.\n\n\u2018Item, they also ordain, that in the above city, and in the towns\nwithin the said bishoprick, no one shall be reputed a citizen unless\nhe shall have really resided within such town in which he shall claim\nhis right of citizenship. And all such rights of citizenship are for\nthe present annulled; for although there may be resident citizens in\nthe aforesaid towns, they cannot, in such right, claim any moveables by\nreason of inheritance, without the cognizance of the lords under whom\nsuch persons have lived, and in whose territory such inheritances are\nsituated.\n\n\u2018Item, they ordain, that from this moment, and in times to come, the\ntowns of Huy, Dinant, and others within the territory of Liege, the\ncountry of Los, the country of Hasbane, and all within the jurisdiction\nof Liege, shall no longer call together any assembly, or congregation\nof people, under pretence of holding councils or otherwise, without the\nconsent of their aforesaid bishop and lord, or of the chapter of Liege,\nshould the bishoprick at the time be vacant.\n\n\u2018Item, they ordain, that the bishop of Liege, or any others having the\ngovernment of the said territory and its dependancies, shall never bear\narms against the king or kings of France, their successors; nor against\nthe two said dukes, their successors in the said duchies and counties;\nnor against the count de Namur for the time being, or his successors;\nnor against any of the countries, of the aforesaid, except when ordered\nby the emperor, and only when the emperor shall be himself present:\nprovided, nevertheless, that the king of France and the above-mentioned\npersons do not invade the territories of the bishop and chapter of\nLiege.\n\n\u2018Item, they likewise ordain, that in perpetual remembrance of this\nvictory, and the conquest made over them by the above two dukes, they\nand their successors shall have a free passage, whenever they may\nchoose to cross the river Meuse, through all towns in the territory of\nLiege, fortified or not, and with a body of men at arms or with few\nattendants according to their pleasure,--provided they do not permit\nany of the inhabitants of the said towns, villages, or country through\nwhich they shall pass, to be any way molested by their men,--and\nprovisions shall be found them for their money, without demanding\nhigher prices for the articles than they are usually sold for.\n\n\u2018Item, they ordain, that the coin of the aforesaid dukes and their\nsuccessors shall have free currency throughout the territories and\ndependancies of the bishop and chapter of Liege.\n\n\u2018Item, they ordain, that a chapel shall be erected on the spot where\nthe last victory was gained, and funds allotted for the support of four\nchaplains and two priests; and the said chapels shall be furnished\nwith chasubles, chalices, and other ornaments for celebrating mass\nand such other divine services as shall be thought advisable for the\neternal welfare of the souls of those who were slain in that battle.\nThe nomination to the above benefices shall remain with the two dukes,\naccording to regulations which they shall hereafter make between\nthemselves,--the Liegeois only to be once at the expense of providing\nthis chapel with sacred vessels and ornaments. The bishop of Liege\nshall allot from his revenues two hundred golden crowns of annual rent\nfor the support of the four chaplains and two priests; that is to say,\nfor each chaplain forty crowns, for each priest ten crowns, and for the\nrepairs of the chapel twenty crowns.\n\n\u2018Item, the said dukes will, that on the twenty-third day of every month\nof September, on which day the battle took place, a mass shall be\ncelebrated to the blessed Virgin, with great solemnity, by the provost\nor dean of the church of St Lambert, in Liege, who shall chaunt it in\nthe choir and at the grand altar, in commemoration of this victory,\nand for the welfare of the souls of those who fell in battle. The same\nshall be required of all the churches and chapels to monasteries, as\nwell for men as women, within the said town of Liege, as of all others\nwithin its jurisdiction.\n\n\u2018Item, the said dukes require from the bishop of Liege and the chapter,\nthat they strictly enjoin such services to be regularly performed on\nevery twenty-third day of September throughout the diocese; and that\nall priests, after the performing of this service, shall be suffered\npeaceably to return to their homes.\n\n\u2018Item, they ordain, that the bishop of Liege and his successors, and\nsuch as may have the government of the country in times of a vacancy\nin the see, and the members of the chapter of Liege, shall appoint\nsuch governor of the castle of Huy as they shall approve of: in which\ncastle, likewise, they shall not place a greater garrison, nor more\nstores of provision, than they shall judge expedient, like as an\nupright lord shall determine. They also insist on having a free ingress\nand regress into and from the town of Huy and the adjacent country.\nThey likewise ordain the same regulations respecting the castles of\nEscoquehen[15] and Bouillon, as to their governors, garrisons and\nstores.\n\n\u2018Item, the aforesaid dukes ordain, that should any one, however\nhigh his rank, attempt, by force, or otherwise, to deprive those of\nsuch gifts and preferments in the church, or any other offices for\nlife, as have been usually granted by the bishops of Liege and their\npredecessors, the members of the chapter of Liege shall be bound to\nrestore, and defend them in, their possessions to the utmost of their\npower, without any fraud whatever.\n\n\u2018Item, as there are still living many perverse conspirators, who are\nnow fugitives from the territories of Liege and county of Los, and\nhave retired into the neighbouring countries, where they have been\nreceived, the dukes aforesaid will appoint proper commissioners to\nmake inquiry whither such wicked persons have gone, and publish their\nnames. On the discovery of the places to which they have withdrawn,\napplications shall be made to the princes and lords thereof, that they\nmay be surrendered to the bishop of Liege, for him to inflict on them\nthe punishments due to their deserts, or at least that such princes\nand lords may drive them out of their respective countries. But should\nthese lords refuse to comply, or to do justice on such conspirators,\nthey shall be for ever banished from the bishoprick of Liege, the\ncounty of Los, and their dependancies, as conspirators and movers of\nsedition; and it shall be proclaimed throughout the above countries,\nthat no one receive them within their houses, but deliver them up\nto justice, should any attempt to return, demanding assistance from\ntheir lord, should there be a necessity for it. Should they be unable\nto arrest them, they shall denounce them to the nearest officers of\njustice, under pain of suffering corporal punishment, and having their\nfortunes confiscated, as would have been done to such conspirators\nand rebels. While exerting themselves in the performance of this\nduty, should they accidentally put to death any of such rebels, no\nconsequences shall ensue to their loss.\n\n\u2018Item, they ordain that the walls of the castle of Thuin, with its\ngates and towers, be razed, as well the part toward the town as that\ntoward the mountain, and the ditches filled up.\n\n\u2018Item, the same to be done to the town of Fosse and to the town\nand castle of Commun,--which towns shall not be repaired. And in\nlike manner shall all the posts on the river Sambre be destroyed,\nthe ditches filled, and neither they nor the towns shall be ever\nagain repaired, so that they may serve for places of defence to the\ninhabitants, on any pretence, in future times.\n\n\u2018Item, the gates, walls and towers of Dinant shall be pulled down, as\nwell on the opposite side of the Meuse as on this; and the inhabitants\nshall never rebuild them again.\n\n\u2018Item, the inhabitants of the said towns of Thuin, Fosse, Commun and\nDinant, or any persons from other towns, shall not rebuild or repair\nthe fortified places between or on the two rivers Sambre and Meuse, on\nthe road to Namur.\n\n\u2018Item, one of the gates of Tongres shall also be razed, namely, that\nwhich leads to Maestricht, with forty feet of wall on each side of the\nsaid gate, without a possibility of its ever being re-erected. The town\nof Tongres shall likewise, at its own expense, cause to be filled up\nthe trenches they had opened before the said town, when they besieged\ntheir lord within it, because they had put the country of Liege under\nheavy taxes, and had subjugated it.\n\n\u2018And whereas it is notorious, that very great losses have attended this\nsubjugation, the aforesaid dukes will, that an aid be levied on this\ncity, and the towns before mentioned, to the amount of two hundred and\ntwenty thousand golden crowns, which shall be raised as soon as may be,\nbeing levied in proportion to the comparative riches of each inhabitant.\n\n\u2018Item, in case any of the hostages shall die before all the articles\nof this treaty are completed, the aforesaid lords will, that the town\nor district whence such hostage or hostages shall have been sent, do\ninstantly furnish others of the same rank and property as those who\nhave died.\n\n\u2018Item, they ordain, that when this treaty shall be properly engrossed,\nthe bishop of Liege, his chapter, and the principal inhabitants, shall\ncome to sign it, and engage, that should any articles of it be not\ncompleted according to the exact tenor of the terms, then for each\nomission or neglect the bishop, his successors, the chapter and chief\ntowns shall forfeit two hundred thousand golden crowns of the coin of\nthe king of France, or other florins of gold of France, of the value\nof the aforesaid crowns. That is to say, fifty thousand to the then\nemperor or king of the Romans; to the king of France fifty thousand;\nand to each of the said dukes the like sum;--the whole to be levied on\nthe lands and moveables of the said Liegeois, by seizure of their goods\nand bodies wherever they may be.\n\n\u2018They are likewise to signify their consent, that should obstacles be\nthrown in the way by any of the said towns to prevent the articles\nof the said treaty from being carried into effect, the bishop of\nLiege, and the archbishop of Cologne for the time being, shall be the\narbitrators between such towns,--and their decision shall be final.\n\n\u2018When a legal pope shall be elected, and his authority over the whole\nchurch of God be acknowledged, then such as make opposition to the\nexecution of the above treaty shall be laid under an interdict, which\nshall not be taken off, until sufficient reparation be made, and the\naforesaid pecuniary forfeitures be paid.\n\n\u2018Should any of the towns, or their inhabitants, offer any insult, in\ncontradiction to the above treaty, to either of the said dukes or\ntheir successors, the bishop of Liege, or his vicar in his absence,\nthe chapter and citizens shall be required to constrain the offenders\nto make full reparation within one month from the time of complaint\nbeing made. And should such reparation not be made within the month,\nas aforesaid, after the summons to that effect has been delivered, the\ncountry shall be liable to the same fines as before mentioned.\n\n\u2018The dukes of Burgundy and of Holland order, that all these articles be\nfairly engrossed, and then sealed with their seals, and then given to\nthe lord bishop of Liege, or to his chapter, with a copy for the city\nof Liege and one for each principal town. In return, the bishop and the\ntowns shall give to the dukes aforesaid letters signed with their great\nseals acknowledging the receipt of the above treaty, and promising\nobedience to all the articles of it, and binding themselves to the\nfines therein mentioned.\n\n\u2018As many noble persons and others, as well secular as ecclesiastic,\nhave presented many petitions to complain of the great losses they have\nsuffered during the late rebellion, and specifying their particular\ngrievances,--the dukes aforesaid, not having had time to examine them\nwith the attention they deserve, will have them examined with all\npossible speed, and will attend to each of them.\u2019\n\nThe whole of the above, having been written out fair, was, by the\ncommand of the two dukes aforesaid, publicly proclaimed in the great\nhall at Lille, and in their presence, the 24th day of October, in the\nyear 1408.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. IV.\n\n    THE KING OF FRANCE HOLDS A GRAND COUNCIL AT PARIS, TO CONSIDER\n    ON THE MANNER OF PROCEEDING AGAINST THE DUKE OF BURGUNDY FOR\n    THE MURDER OF THE DUKE OF ORLEANS.\n\n\nDuring the expedition of the duke of Burgundy against the Liegeois, a\ngreat many of the principal lords were, by the king\u2019s orders, assembled\nat Paris. Among them were, Louis king of Sicily, Charles king of\nNavarre, the duke of Brittany, the duke of Bourbon, and several others,\nthe greater part of whom were friendly to the duchess-dowager of\nOrleans and her children in their prosecution of the duke of Burgundy.\nMany councils were held as to the manner in which the king should\nproceed against the duke of Burgundy, who was the principal actor in\nthis murder, as has been before explained.\n\nIt was at length determined in these councils, that a most rigorous\nprosecution, in conformity to the laws, should be carried on against\nhim; and should he refuse to obey, the king, with all his subjects\nand vassals, should march, with as great a force as could be raised,\nagainst him, to bring him and his abettors to due obedience.\n\nAt the same time, at the solicitations of the duchess of Orleans\nand her children, the king annulled all his letters of pardon which\nhe had formerly granted to the duke of Burgundy, and declared them\nof no weight, in the presence of the queen, the duke of Acquitaine,\nthe princes of the blood, and the whole of the council. The duchess\ndemanded and obtained letters, confirming this renunciation of the\npardon; after which, she and her daughter-in-law, wife to the young\nduke of Orleans, left Paris, and returned to Blois.\n\nNot long after this, news came to Paris of the great victory which\nthe duke of Burgundy had gained over the Liegeois. This was confirmed\nby the return of the king\u2019s ambassadors, sir Guichard Daulphin and\nsir William de Tignonville, who, as has been related, were present at\nthe battle, and gave to the king and the lords then in Paris a most\ncircumstantial account of it. On hearing this, several who had been\nmost violent against the duke of Burgundy, now hung their heads, and\nbegan to be of a contrary opinion to what they had before held, fearing\nthe steadiness, boldness and power of the duke, who was said to have a\nmind equal to the support of any misfortunes that should happen to him,\nand which would encourage him to oppose and conquer all attempts of his\nadversaries. In short, all the measures that had been adopted against\nhim were dropped, and the men at arms were ordered to return to the\nplaces whence they had come.\n\nAmbassadors had arrived from England to treat of a peace, or a truce\nfor one year, between the kings of England and of France, which having\nobtained, they set out on their return, through Amiens and Boulogne,\nto Calais. On the road, they heard of the grand victory of the duke\nof Burgundy, which surprised them very much,--and they gave him the\nsurname of \u2018Jean sans peur.\u2019\n\nThe duke of Burgundy was very active in attaching to his party noblemen\nand warriors from all countries, to strengthen himself against his\nenemies, of whom he was given to understand that he had many. He\nheld on this subject several consultations with his two brothers and\nbrothers-in-law, namely, duke William of Holland and John of Bavaria,\nto which were admitted his most trusty friends; and they deliberated\nlong on the manner in which he should now carry himself. It was at\nlength finally concluded, that he should openly oppose all, excepting\nthe king of France and the duke of Acquitaine; and those present\npromised him aid and support with all the power of their vassals, on\nthese terms.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. V.\n\n    THE KING OF FRANCE IS CARRIED, BY THE PRINCES OF THE BLOOD,\n    TO TOURS IN TOURAINE.----PEACE IS MADE IN THE TOWN OF\n    CHARTRES.--THE DEATH OF THE DOWAGER DUCHESS OF ORLEANS.\n\n\nThe king of France left Paris, accompanied by the kings of Sicily and\nNavarre, the queen, the duke of Acquitaine, the dukes of Berry and\nBourbon, who, with others of the blood-royal, conducted him, under\nthe escort of a large body of men at arms, to Tours in Touraine, as\nhis place of residence,--to the great displeasure of the inhabitants\nof Paris, who were so much troubled thereat that they barricadoed the\nstreets with chains. They hastily sent to inform the duke of Burgundy,\nat Lille, of the king\u2019s departure, giving him to understand that the\ngreater part of those who had carried him away from Paris were not well\ninclined towards him.\n\nThis intelligence was not very agreeable to the duke, for he suspected\nthat the king had only been conducted to Tours that his enemies might\ncarry their measures against him more securely; for the lords who had\nthe government knew well that the Parisians loved the duke of Burgundy,\nand would not that any other should have the government of the kingdom,\nbelieving, from the hints he had thrown out, that when in power he\nwould abolish all gabelles and other taxes which oppressed the people.\n\nThe duke of Burgundy first consulted the dukes of Brabant and of\nHolland, and other steady friends, and then remanded his men at arms\nfrom Burgundy, who were on their march to their own country from Liege,\nand assembled another body from various parts. He advanced to Roye, in\nthe Vermandois, where he mustered his men, and then marched them toward\nParis. He quartered himself, on the 23d day of November, in the town of\nSt Denis, and his forces in the adjacent country. On the morrow, as he\nwas advancing with his men at arms in array toward Paris, two thousand\nor more combatants sallied out thence, and conducted him, with every\nmark of honour, to his h\u00f4tel of Artois.\n\nMany of the Parisians sung carols in the squares, although all\nrejoicings had been strictly forbidden on his arrival, to avoid\nincreasing the envy of the princes of the blood. Some of the king\u2019s\nservants said to those who were singing carols, \u2018You may otherwise\nshow your joy for his arrival, but you ought not thus to sing.\u2019\nNotwithstanding this, all the principal citizens, and those in\nauthority, showed him as much honour and respect as if he had been king\nhimself.\n\nA few days afterward, duke William, count of Hainault, arrived at\nParis, well accompanied by unarmed men, and, at the request of the\nduke of Burgundy, set out for Tours, attended by the lords de Croy,\nde St George, de la Viefville, d\u2019Olhaz, and others of the council of\nthe duke, to negotiate his peace with the king, and the lords who had\ncarried him from Paris. The count of Hainault was most honourably\nreceived at Tours by the king, the queen, and the other great lords;\nfor the marriage had taken place between John duke of Touraine, second\nson to the king, and the daughter of the duke of Burgundy: he was also\nnearly related to the queen.\n\nOn the conclusion of the feasts made on his arrival, the count of\nHainault and those who had accompanied him opened, in full council,\nthe business of their mission, namely, to make peace for the duke\nof Burgundy. After many discussions, it was resolved, that the king\nshould send certain persons, selected by him, to hold a conference with\nthe duke of Burgundy at Paris, and point out to him the means of his\nregaining the good graces of the king.\n\nDuke Louis of Bavaria, brother to the queen, Montagu grand master of\nthe king\u2019s household, and other experienced counsellors, were nominated\nfor this purpose; and they returned with the count de Hainault to\nParis, when what had passed was told to the duke of Burgundy.\n\nAs all the circumstances of this treaty were not agreeable to the duke,\nand as he had many suspicions respecting Montagu, he was not disposed\nto receive the negotiators in the way they were sent to him. He even\npersonally made many reproaches to Montagu, who bore them patiently,\nexcusing himself for any thing that had passed. The treaty, however,\nhaving been altered and corrected, was sent back to the king at Tours,\nand in the end agreed to in the manner you shall hear.\n\nWhile these negotiations were going forward, and before their\nconclusion, the duchess-dowager of Orleans, daughter to Galeazzo duke\nof Milan, died in the town of Blois, broken-hearted at not having been\nable to obtain justice from the king and council against the duke of\nBurgundy for the murder of her late lord and husband, Louis duke of\nOrleans. The duke of Burgundy was much rejoiced at this event, for the\nduchess had bitterly carried on her prosecution against him.\n\nHer heart was buried at Paris, near that of her husband, and her body\nin the church of the canons at Blois. After her death, Charles, her\neldest son, was duke of Orleans and of Valois, count of Blois and of\nBeaumont, lord of Coni and of Ast, with many other lordships:--Philip,\nthe second son, was count of Vertus,--and John, the youngest, was named\ncount of Angoul\u00eame. These three brothers, and one sister, thus became\norphans, but they had been very well educated; yet, by the deaths of\nthe duke and duchess of Orleans, they were much weakened in support\nand advice,--and several of the king\u2019s ministers were not so zealous\nto prosecute the duke of Burgundy as they had been. This was very\napparent in the negotiations which took place some little time after\nthe death of the duchess, between the duke of Burgundy and the children\nof Orleans; for although the treaty sent by the king was not wholly to\nthe liking of the duke, as has been said, yet it was so corrected that\nthe parties accepted of it, in the following terms:\n\nFirst, it was ordered by the king and his great council, that the duke\nof Burgundy should depart from Paris with his men at arms, and return\nto his own country, where he was to remain until a certain day, namely,\nthe first Wednesday in February, when he was to meet the king at the\ntown of Chartres, accompanied only by one hundred gentlemen at arms,\nand the children of Orleans with fifty. It was also ordered, that duke\nWilliam, count of Hainault, should have under his command four hundred\nof the king\u2019s men at arms, to preserve the peace. It was also ordered,\nthat the duke of Burgundy, when he appeared before the king, should be\nattended by one of his council, who should repeat the words he was to\nsay; and the duke, in confirmation of them, was to add, \u2018We will and\nagree that it should be thus.\u2019\n\nAfterward, according to the tenor of the treaty, the king was to say to\nthe duke of Burgundy, \u2018We will, that the count de Vertus, our nephew,\nhave one of your daughters in marriage.\u2019 The duke was by this treaty to\nassign over to his daughter three thousand livres parisis yearly, and\ngive her one hundred and fifty thousand golden francs.\n\nWhen this treaty had been concluded, duke William set out from Paris\nfor Hainault; and shortly after, the duke of Burgundy disbanded his men\nat arms, and left Paris to go to Lille, whither he had summoned the\nduke of Brabant his brother, duke William and the bishop of Liege, his\nbrothers-in-law, and many other great lords.\n\nAt this period, there was a great quarrel between the duke of Brabant\nand duke William. It was caused by the father of duke William having\nborrowed in former times from the late duchess of Brabant one hundred\nand fifty thousand florins to carry on a war against some of his\nrebellious subjects in Holland, which sum the duke of Brabant had\nclaimed as belonging to him. He had in consequence, by the advice\nof his Brabanters, taken possession of a castle called Heusden[16],\nsituated between Brabant and Holland.\n\nThe duke of Burgundy took great pains to make up the quarrel between\nthese two princes, that they might the more effectually assist him in\nhis plans, which were very extensive. After this business had been\nsettled, and the parties had separated, duke William assembled in\nHainault, according to the king of France\u2019s orders, four hundred men\nat arms and as many archers. The principal lords among them were, the\ncounts de Namur, de Conversant and de Salmes. The duke of Burgundy,\nconformably to the treaty, set out, the day after Ash-Wednesday,\nattended by his son-in-law the count de Penthievre[17], and lay at\nBapaume. Thence he went to Paris, with duke William, the above-named\nlords, the count de St Pol, the count de Vaudemont[18], and several\nothers of the nobility.\n\nOn Saturday, the 2d day of March, they arrived all together at the\ntown of Gallardon, four leagues distant from Chartres. The Wednesday\nfollowing, duke William of Holland advanced with his body of forces to\nChartres, where the king then was. On the ensuing Saturday, the duke\nof Burgundy set out from Gallardon, to wait on the king, escorted by\nsix hundred men at arms; but when he approached Chartres, he dismissed\nthem all, excepting one hundred light horsemen, in compliance with the\ntreaty, and thus entered Chartres about ten o\u2019clock in the morning,\nriding strait to the church as far as the cloisters of the canons,\nwhere he was lodged.\n\nAt this same time, the duke of Orleans, in company with his brother the\ncount de Vertus, and, according to the treaty, attended by only fifty\nmen at arms, entered the church of our Lady at Chartres, with the king\ntheir uncle, the queen, the duke of Acquitaine, and several princes of\nthe blood.\n\nThat the king and lords might not be pressed upon by the spectators,\nand that all might plainly see the ceremony, a scaffolding was erected\nin the church, on which the king was seated near the crucifix. Round\nhim were placed the queen, the dauphin and dauphiness, daughter to the\nduke of Burgundy, the kings of Sicily and Navarre, the dukes of Berry\nand Bourbon; the cardinal de Bar, the marquis du Pont his brother, the\narchbishop of Sens, and the bishop of Chartres, with other counts,\nprelates, and the family of Orleans were behind the king. At the\nentrance of the church, by the king\u2019s orders, were a body of men at\narms drawn up in battle-array.\n\nIt was not long before the duke of Burgundy entered the church, and on\nhis advancing toward the king, all the lords, excepting the king, queen\nand dauphin, rose up from their seats. The duke, on his approach to the\nking, kneeled down with his advocate the lord d\u2019Ollehaing, who repeated\nto the king the following words:\n\n\u2018Sire, behold here my lord of Burgundy, your subject and cousin, who\nis thus come before you, because he has heard you are angry with him,\nfor the action he has committed against the person of the late duke of\nOrleans your brother, for the good of yourself and your kingdom,--the\ntruth of which he is ready to declare and prove to you, whenever you\nshall please. My lord, therefore, entreats of you, in the most humble\nmanner possible, that you would be pleased to withdraw from him your\nanger, and restore him to your good graces.\u2019 When the lord d\u2019Ollehaing\nhad said this, the duke of Burgundy himself addressed the king, saying,\n\u2018Sire, I entreat this of you:\u2019--when instantly the duke of Berry,\nseeing the king made no reply, bade the duke of Burgundy retire some\npaces behind,--which being done, the duke of Berry, kneeling before\nthe king, said something to him in a low voice,--and immediately the\ndauphin, the kings of Sicily and Navarre, with the duke of Berry, knelt\ndown to the king, and said, \u2018Sire, we supplicate that you would be\npleased to listen to the prayer of your cousin the duke of Burgundy.\u2019\nThe king answered them, \u2018We will that it be so,--and we grant it from\nour love to you.\u2019\n\nThe duke of Burgundy then approached the king, who said to him,--\u2018Fair\ncousin, we grant your request, and pardon you fully for what you have\ndone.\u2019 After this, he advanced, with the lord d\u2019Ollehaing, toward the\nchildren of Orleans, who, as I have said, were behind the king weeping\nmuch.\n\nThe lord d\u2019Ollehaing addressed them, saying, \u2018My lords, behold the\nduke of Burgundy, who entreats of you to withdraw from your hearts\nwhatever hatred or revenge you may harbour within them, for the act\nperpetrated against the person of my lord of Orleans, your father, and\nthat henceforward ye may remain good friends.\u2019 The duke of Burgundy\nthen added, \u2018And I beg this of you.\u2019 No answer being made, the king\ncommanded them to accede to the request of his fair cousin the duke\nof Burgundy. Upon which they replied, \u2018Sire, since you are pleased to\ncommand us, we grant him his request, and shall extinguish all the\nhatred we bore him; for we should be sorry to disobey you in any thing\nthat may give you pleasure.\u2019\n\nThe cardinal de Bar then, by the king\u2019s orders, brought an open Bible,\non which the two parties, namely, the two sons of the late duke of\nOrleans and the duke of Burgundy swore on the holy evangelists,\ntouching them with their hands, that they would mutually preserve a\nfirm peace towards each other, without any open or secret attempts\ncontrary to the full meaning of their oaths. When this was done, the\nking said, \u2018We will that henceforth ye be good friends; and I most\nstrictly enjoin, that neither of you attempt any thing to the loss or\nhurt of the other, nor against any persons who are attached to you,\nor who may have given you advice or assistance; and that you show\nno hatred against any one on this occasion, under pain of offending\nagainst our royal authority,--excepting, however, those who actually\ncommitted this murder, who shall be for ever banished from our kingdom.\u2019\n\nAfter this speech of the king, these princes again swore they would\nfaithfully abide by their treaty. The duke of Burgundy then advanced\nto salute the wife of the dauphin, the duke of Acquitaine; and about\nan hour after this ceremony had taken place the duke took his leave\nof the king, queen, and the lords present, and set out from Chartres\nfor Gallardon, where he dined. Many who were there were very much\nrejoiced that matters had gone off so well; but others were displeased,\nand murmured, saying, that henceforward it would be no great offence\nto murder a prince of the blood, since those who had done so were so\neasily acquitted, without making any reparation, or even begging pardon.\n\nThe duke of Orleans and his brother shortly after took leave of the\nking, queen, dauphin, and the lords of the court, and returned, with\ntheir attendants, to Blois, whence they had come, not well satisfied,\nany more than their council, with the peace that had been made.\n\nThe marquis du Pont, son to the duke of Bar, and cousin to the duke of\nBurgundy, who before this day was not beloved by him, on account of\nthe murder of the duke of Orleans, followed him to Gallardon, where\nthey dined publicly together in great friendship and concord. About two\no\u2019clock in the afternoon duke William, the count de St Pol, and other\ngreat lords, visited the duke of Burgundy at his lodgings in Gallardon,\nand then returned together toward Paris.\n\nThe king, the queen, the dauphin, and the other kings, princes and\ncardinals, arrived at Paris on Mid-Lent Sunday; and the dukes of\nBurgundy and of Holland, with the cardinal de Bordeaux, who was at that\ntime in Paris, on his way to the council of Pisa, went out to meet\nthem, followed by upwards of two hundred thousand Parisians of both\nsexes, eager to receive the king, singing carols, as he entered the\ngates, and conducting him with great rejoicings to his palace.\n\nThey were very happy that the king was returned to Paris, and also that\na peace had been concluded respecting the death of the late duke of\nOrleans. They attributed the whole to the great mercy of God, who had\npermitted that such strong symptoms of a civil war should be so readily\nextinguished; but they did not foresee or consider the consequences\nthat ensued.\n\nThe greater part of the Parisians were obstinately attached to the\nduke of Burgundy, through the hope that by his means all the most\noppressive taxes would be abolished; but they did not see clearly all\nthe mischiefs that afterward befel the kingdom and themselves,--for in\na very short time, as you shall hear, a most cruel contention broke out\nbetween the families of Orleans and Burgundy.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. VI.\n\n    THE QUEEN OF SPAIN DIES DURING THE SITTING OF THE COUNCIL AT\n    PISA.--THE MARRIAGE OF THE KING OF DENMARK, NORWAY AND SWEDEN.\n\n\nIn this year died the queen of Spain[19], sister to Henry king of\nEngland, and mother to the young king of Spain and queen of Portugal.\nThe Spaniards after her death sent home all the english servants, male\nand female, belonging to the late queen, who returned to England in\nmuch grief and sorrow at heart.\n\nAt this same season, great numbers of prelates, archbishops, bishops\nand abbots, set out from various countries of Christendom to attend the\ncouncil at Pisa which was assembling to restore union to the church,\nwhich had for a long time suffered a schism, to the great displeasure\nof many princes and well-inclined persons.\n\nAbout this same period, Henry[20] king of Denmark, Norway and Sweden,\ntook to wife the daughter of Henry king of England. These kingdoms were\nput into the hands of the king of Denmark by their queen, who divested\nherself of all power and profit over them in favour of king Henry.\n\n\n\n\n[A. D. 1409.]\n\nCHAP. VII.\n\n    THE KING OF FRANCE HAS A SEVERE RETURN OF HIS DISORDER.--THE\n    MARRIAGE OF THE COUNT DE NEVERS WITH THE DAMSEL OF COUCY.--THE\n    WAR OF AM\u00c9 DE VIRY, A SAVOYARD, WITH THE DUKE OF BOURBON.\n\n\nAt the beginning of this year, Charles king of France was much\noppressed with his usual disorder. On this account, when the kings of\nNavarre and Sicily, and the duke of Berry, had properly provided, in\nconjunction with the duke of Burgundy, for the state of the king, and\nthe government of the realm, they went to visit their own territories.\nIn like manner, the duke of Burgundy, went to the marriage of his\nbrother Philip count of Nevers, who took to wife the damsel of Coucy,\ndaughter to sir Enguerrand de Coucy[21], formerly lord and count of\nSoissons, and niece by the mother\u2019s side to the duke of Lorraine and to\nthe count de Vaudemont; which marriage was celebrated in the town of\nSoissons.\n\nThis ceremony was performed on Saint George\u2019s day, and the feasts and\nentertainments lasted for three days afterward. There were present the\nduchess of Lorraine[22] and the countess of Vaudemont[23], who had come\nexpressly thither to do honour to the lady of Coucy and her daughter.\n\nWhen these feasts were over, the duke of Burgundy, attended by his\nson-in-law the count de Penthievre, set out for Burgundy; and shortly\nafter, the count de Nevers conducted his wife, and the duchess of\nLorraine and the countess of Vaudemont, to his county of Rethel, where\nshe was received with every token of joy.\n\nDuring this time, the duke of Bourbon was challenged by Am\u00e9 de Viry,\na Savoyard, and a poor blade in comparison with the duke of Bourbon;\nnevertheless, he committed much damage by fire and sword in the\ncountries of Bresse and Beaujolois. The duke was very indignant at\nthis, and assembled a large body of men at arms and archers to punish\nand conquer him. He ordered his son, the count de Clermont, to lead on\nthe van, and he speedily followed in person.\n\nIn his company were the counts de la Marche and de Vend\u00f4me, the lord\nd\u2019Albret, constable of France, Louis de Baviere, brother to the queen,\nMontagu, grand master of the king\u2019s household, the lord de la Heuse and\nmany more great lords, who advanced with a numerous body of men to the\ncounty of Beaujolois.\n\nAm\u00e9 de Viry was informed of the great force which the duke of Bourbon\nwas marching against him, and dared not wait his arrival; for he had\nnot strength enough to garrison the forts he had taken. On his retreat,\nhe marched to a town called Bourg-en-Bresse, which belonged to the earl\nof Savoy, his lord. The earl, however, would not support him against\nhis great uncle, the duke of Bourbon, but gave him up, on condition\nthat Am\u00e9 should make every amends in his power for the mischiefs he had\ndone, and should surrender himself to one of the prisons of the duke,\nuntil he should have completely made him satisfaction, but that no harm\nof any sort should be done to his person.\n\nThe duke of Bourbon gladly received him, and thanked his nephew for his\nfriendship.--This caused a quarrel of some standing to be made up; for\nthe earl of Savoy had declared his great uncle owed him homage for his\nlands of Beaujolois, which he would not pay,--but now the dispute was\nmutually referred by them to the duke of Berry.\n\nWhen these matters were concluded, the duke of Bourbon returned to\nFrance, and disbanded his forces. Some time after, by means which Viry\nmade use of with the duke, he obtained his liberty. Waleran count de\nSt Pol intended being of this expedition with the duke of Bourbon, and\nraised a large force; but on marching near Paris, he was ordered not to\nproceed further, and to return to the frontiers of the Boulonois, where\nhe had been specially commissioned by the king.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. VIII.\n\n    TWO COMBATS TAKE PLACE AT PARIS IN THE PRESENCE OF THE\n    KING.----THE DEATH OF THE ARCHBISHOP OF RHEIMS.----THE COUNCIL\n    AT PISA.\n\n\nAbout Ascension-day, the king of France, who had been grievously ill,\nwas restored to health,--and in consequence, the dukes of Berry,\nBurgundy, and Bourbon, with many other lords, instantly returned to\nParis. Two combats were ordained to be fought in the square behind St\nMartin des Champs, in the presence of the king and the aforesaid lords.\nOne was between a breton knight, called sir William Batailler, and an\nEnglishman, named sir John Carmien, for a breach of faith.\n\nWhen they were met, and Montjoye king at arms had proclaimed their\nchallenges and the causes of them, in the accustomed manner, he bade\nthem do their duty. Sir William, who was the appellant, issued first\nout of his pavilion, and marched proudly toward his adversary, who was\nadvancing to meet him. They threw their lances without effect, and\nthen made use of their swords: but in this last combat the Englishman\nwas slightly wounded below his armour, when the king instantly put an\nend to the fight. They were both very honourably led out of the lists,\nand conducted to their lodgings.\n\nThe other combat was between the seneschal of Hainault and sir John\nCornwall, an english knight of great renown, and who had married a\nsister to the king of England[24]. This combat was undertaken by the\ntwo knights at the desire of the duke of Burgundy, when at Lille, to\nshow their prowess in running a few courses with the lance and giving\nsome strokes with the battle-axe: but when the duke had caused the\nlists to be prepared, the two champions were ordered by the king to\nrepair to Paris, and to perform their deeds of arms in his presence.\n\nAccording to these orders, and on the appointed day, sir John Cornwall\nentered the lists first, very grandly equipped, and, galloping his\nhorse around, came before the king, whom he gallantly saluted. He was\nfollowed by six little pages mounted on as many war-horses, the two\nfirst of which were covered with furniture of ermines, and the other\nfour with cloth of gold. When he had made his obeisances, the pages\nretired without the lists.\n\nShortly after, the seneschal arrived, attended by the duke of Brabant\nand his brother, the count de Nevers, each holding a rein of his horse,\non his right and left. The count de Clermont bore his battle-axe, and\nthe count de Penthievre his lance. When he had made the circuit of the\nlists, and had saluted the king, as sir John Cornwall had done, they\nprepared to tilt with their lances; but as they were on the point of so\ndoing, the king caused it to be proclaimed that they should not proceed\nin this matter, which was very displeasing to both of them, and forced\nthem to return to their h\u00f4tels.\n\nIt was again proclaimed, by the king\u2019s orders, that this deed of arms\nshould not be carried further,--and that in future no one, under pain\nof capital punishment, should, throughout his realm, challenge another\nto a duel without a substantial cause.\n\nWhen the king had magnificently feasted these two knights, and shown\nthem much honour at his court, they departed, as it was said, for\nEngland, with the intention of completing their deed of arms.\n\nDuring this time, the cardinal de Bar, son to the duke of Bar, and\nGuye de Roye, archbishop of Rheims, in company with master Peter\nd\u2019Ailly, bishop of Cambray, and several other prelates and churchmen,\nwere journeying to the general council which was to be held at Pisa,\nand took up their lodgings one night at a town called Voltri, on the\nsea-coast, about four leagues from Genoa. At this place the blacksmith\nof the archbishop had a quarrel with a blacksmith of the town, about\nthe price of shoeing a horse, which proceeded from words to blows, and\nthe archbishop\u2019s blacksmith killed the other, and fled instantly for\nsafety to the lodgings of his master.\n\nThe townsmen immediately rose,--and a great number of them came to\nrevenge the death of their countryman. The archbishop, hearing of the\ncause of this tumult, left his chamber, and kindly addressed them,\npromising to have the injury immediately repaired, according to their\nwishes; and, the more to appease them, he delivered up his blacksmith\ninto the hands of the magistrate of the place, who was a lieutenant of\nBoucicaut marshal of France, then governor of Genoa.\n\nBut this was of no avail,--for as the archbishop was speaking to them,\nwithout the door of his house, one of the mob thrust his javelin right\nthrough his body to the heart, so that he dropped down dead without\nuttering another word. It was a great pity, for he was a religious\nprelate, and of a noble family.\n\nThis deed, however, did not satisfy them; for instantly after they\nmurdered the magistrate and the aforesaid blacksmith, and also\nendeavoured to force their way into the house, whither the cardinal de\nBar and the greater part of the others had retired, in order to put\nthem likewise to death.\n\nThey were, however, at length appeased by the principal inhabitants,\nand it was concluded that the cardinal should grant them his pardon for\nwhat they had done against him,--to which, indeed, he was induced by\nhis attendants, from their fears of being all destroyed.\n\nThey never told him of the murder of the archbishop until he was gone\ntwo leagues from the town: on the hearing of it, he was so troubled,\nand sick at heart, that he was near falling off his mule. His\nattendants, notwithstanding, made him hasten his pace as much as they\ncould; for they were alarmed for their lives, after the instances they\nhad seen, and from the numbers of people they perceived descending\nthe hills, and the accustomed signs they saw when a town is under any\napprehension of danger, and the ringing of bells in the manner usual on\nthese occasions.\n\nThese signals were sounded throughout the country, and the peasants\nwere seen running down the hills to overtake them; but when they were\narrived within a league of Genoa, the marshal Boucicaut[25] came out\nwith a handsome company to meet him. The cardinal made loud complaints\nto him of the outrages that had been committed on his people at the\ntown of Voltri, and demanded that he would judicially inquire into it.\nThe marshal replied, that he would make so severe an example of that\ntown that all others should take warning from it.\n\nThe cardinal was then conducted into the city of Genoa, where he was\nmade welcome by the churchmen and other inhabitants; and this same\nday the body of the archbishop of Rheims was brought thither, and\nhonourably interred,--and his obsequies were performed in the principal\nchurch of Genoa.\n\nShortly after, the marshal Boucicaut punished most severely all whom\nhe could apprehend that had committed these outrages, with their\naccomplices: they were put to death in various ways, and their houses\nalso were razed to the ground, that these executions might serve for\nwarnings to others never to commit such cruel murders.\n\nThe cardinal de Bar, with his companions, now set out from Genoa, and\ntravelled, by easy day\u2019s journies, to Pisa, where were assembled a\nprodigious number of cardinals, doctors in theology, and graduates in\ncivil law and other sciences, ambassadors and prelates, in obedience\nto the two popes, from different kingdoms, and from all parts of\nChristendom.\n\nAfter many councils had been held on the schism in the church, they\ncame at last to this conclusion: they unanimously condemned the\ntwo rival popes as heretics, schismatics, obstinate in evil, and\nperturbators of the peace of our holy mother the church. This sentence\nwas passed in the presence of twenty-four cardinals, at the gates\nof Pisa, before all the people, the 15th day of June, in the year\naforesaid.\n\nThe same cardinals, after invoking the grace and assistance of the\nholy Spirit, entered into conclave, where they remained until the 16th\nday of the same month, when they finished their election. They chose\nPeter of Candia, so named from being a native of that island: he was\nof the order of Friars Minors, created a doctor in theology at Paris,\narchbishop of Milan and cardinal; and, when consecrated sovereign of\nthe true and holy catholic church, he took the name of Pope Alexander V.\n\nO, most powerful God! how great was the joy thus caused, through thy\nnever-failing grace; for it is impossible to relate the shoutings and\nacclamations that resounded for more than a league round the city of\nPisa. But what shall we say of the city of Paris? Why, when this joyful\nnews was brought thither, on the 8th of July, they incessantly shouted,\nnight and day, \u2018Long live Alexander V. our pope!\u2019 in all the squares\nand streets, and entertained all passengers with meat and drink, from\ntheir heartfelt happiness. When the ceremony of consecrating the pope\nwas over, letters were sent to different persons, the more fully to\nexplain the proceedings of the council. I shall insert the one written\nby the abbot of Saint Maixence to the bishop of Poitiers, the tenor of\nwhich was as follows.\n\n\u2018Reverend father, and my redoubted lord, after my humble respects being\naccepted, I know that your reverence would gladly be informed of the\nproceedings of the council, which has been held in the city of Pisa,\nand any intelligence concerning it; and it is for this reason I have\nindited the following lines to your reverence.\n\n\u2018First, then, on the 25th day of March all the cardinals, who had been\ncreated by both popes, and all the prelates then in Pisa, assembled\nin the church of St Martin, which is situated beyond the river, on the\nroad leading to Florence, and thence being dressed in their robes, with\nmitres on their heads, they made a grand procession to the cathedral\nchurch, which is as distant from that of Saint Martin as our church of\nN\u00f4tre Dame at Paris is from that of St Martin des Champs. There the\ncouncil always afterward assembled; and on this first day, mass was\ncelebrated with great solemnity: the sermon was preached by my lord\ncardinal of Milan, of the order of Friars Minors, a great theologian.\nWhen the service was over, the morrow was fixed on to open the council,\nand the two popes were summoned to attend on that day at the gates of\nthe church by two cardinals; but neither of them appeared, nor any one\nfor them.\n\n\u2018The council continued to sit till the latter end of March, when the\npopes were again summoned to appear, but neither of them obeyed. The\ncouncil therefore having required the two rival popes to come before\nthem, on account of the schism that has reigned in the church, and\nneither of them appearing, or sending any one to make satisfactory\nanswers for them, and the term allotted for their appearing being\nelapsed, declared them both guilty of the schism that distresses the\nchurch, and of contumacy, by their conduct, toward the council.\n\n\u2018The council ordered prosecutions to be carried on against both of the\npopes, on the Monday after Quasimodo-Sunday, the 15th of April, when\nmy lords cardinals celebrated together the service of the holy week.\nOn Good Friday, my lord cardinal d\u2019Orsini celebrated divine service in\nSaint Martin\u2019s church; and a secular doctor of divinity, from Bologna\nla Grassa, preached an excellent sermon.\n\n\u2018My lords cardinals were all present at the ceremonies of Easter\nSunday. During the ensuing week they assembled in council, sometimes\nalone, at others they called in the prelates, to deliberate on the\nstate of affairs, and what line of conduct should be pursued; and every\nthing was carried on with mutual good will on all sides. This week the\nambassadors from the king of the Romans arrived at Pisa.\n\n\u2018On the Sunday of Quasimodo, an italian bishop said mass before the\ncardinals; and a cordelier from Languedoc, a doctor in divinity\npreached the sermon, in which he greatly praised my lords cardinals\nfrom France, and such as were seeking to restore peace to the\nchurch,--but very harshly treated the two contending popes, calling\nthem schismatics, heretics, and traitorous enemies to God and to his\nchurch. He chose for his text, \u2018Jesus dixit, Pax vobis,\u2019 which he\nhandled extraordinarily well.\n\n\u2018The following Monday, the cardinals, prelates, ambassadors, and\nprocurators then present, made oath to obey the decisions of the\ncouncil. Mass was then chaunted, and succeeded by many prayers; then\nthe litany was sung, at which all the cardinals and prelates, dressed\nin their robes and mitres, attended, and so continued as long as the\nsittings of the council lasted, which made it a handsome sight to see.\n\n\u2018This same day, the council gave audience to the ambassadors from\nRobert king of the Romans; and the bishop of Verdun, on the part of\nRobert, who favoured pope Gregory as much as he could, began his\nharangue, taking for his theme, \u2018Pax vobis.\u2019 He made many mischievous\npropositions, to divide and distract the council, in obedience to\nhis master, and to serve the false pope Gregory. There were with\nthis bishop an archbishop of a foreign order, and a numerous body of\nattendants. When the bishop had made his propositions, the ambassadors\nwere required to deliver the same in writing, and to show their\nprocurations from their lord. A day was then fixed to hear the answer\nof the council to their propositions; but before this day arrived, the\nambassadors went away without taking leave of their host.\n\n\u2018This week of Quasimodo, the lord Malatesta came to Pisa in great\nstate: he had given to pope Gregory one of his castles called\nRimini[26], and made the following request to the cardinals assembled,\nas well on the part of pope Gregory as on his own,--namely, that it\nwould please the members of the council to adjourn its sittings, and\nchange the place of its meeting; that if they would so do, pope Gregory\nwould attend personally, provided the situation were in a place of\nsafety, and that he might have security for his coming to and going\nfrom it.\n\n\u2018In consequence of this request, the cardinals summoned the prelates to\nnotify it to them; but they unanimously declared, they would neither\nconsent that the place of holding the council should be changed nor\nthat the meetings of it should be adjourned. This answer was very\nagreeable to the cardinals. The lord Malatesta, therefore, returned\nwithout having succeeded in his object; but his anger was appeased by\nsome of the cardinals, his friends and acquaintance.\n\n\u2018From the 15th of April, the council continued sitting to the 23d\nof the said month,--when, after the solemnity of the mass, the\nadvocate-fiscal demanded, that the council should declare, that the\nconjunction of the two colleges of cardinals of the holy church of Rome\nhad been, and was, lawful and canonical at the time it was formed.\n\n\u2018Item, that it should declare, that this holy council is duly\ncanonical, by the cardinals of both colleges assembling for so\nexcellent a purpose.\n\n\u2018Item, that this holy council has been called together by the cardinals\nof both colleges with a good intent.\n\n\u2018Item, that it has been assembled at a convenient opportunity.\n\n\u2018Item, that it should declare, that this holy council, as representing\nthe universal church of God, has a right to take cognizance of the\nmerits of the two competitors for the papacy.\n\n\u2018Item, that a narrative should this day be read of the introduction and\ncommencement of the schism that took place from the time of the death\nof pope Gregory X. until the convention of this holy general council.\n\n\u2018In this narrative were displayed all the tricks and deceits that had\nbeen made use of, either individually or conjunctively by the two rival\npopes.\n\n\u2018After it had been read, the advocate fiscal drew several conclusions\nagainst the said rivals and their pretensions to the papacy, and ended\nhis harangue by demanding that they should be deposed and punished\ncorporally, and that the council should proceed to the election of a\ntrue and holy pope.\n\n\u2018The sittings were prolonged to Saturday the 27th day of the same\nmonth, when the ambassadors from the king of England entered the\ncouncil with a most magnificent state.--The bishop of Salisbury[27],\nin the diocese of Canterbury, made a handsome speech, urging the\nnecessity of peace and union in the church.\n\n\u2018When he had finished, the advocate-fiscal made an interesting oration,\nand concluded by demanding, through the procurator of the holy council,\nthat it would please to appoint a commission of certain wise, discreet,\nand experienced persons to examine witnesses as to the notorious sins\ncharged on the two competitors for the papacy, and his request was\ngranted.\n\n\u2018The second Sunday after Easter, mass was celebrated before the\ncardinals, and the sermon was preached by the bishop of Digne in\nProvence: he was of the order of Friars Minors, a learned doctor in\ndivinity, and had ever been a great friend to Pietro della Luna, and\nwas well acquainted with the tricks and cavils of both popes. This\nbishop delivered a good sermon from his text of \u2018Mercenarius fugit,\u2019 in\nwhich he discovered many deceptions of the two rivals, in descanting on\nthe words of his text.\n\n\u2018The sittings were continued from this Sunday to the 2d day of May,\nwhen mass was said before the cardinals; and the sermon was preached\nby the cardinal Prenestin, more commonly called the cardinal of\nPoitiers.--He delivered a good discourse, and chose for his text,\n\u2018Libera Deus Israel ex omnibus tribulationibus suis.\u2019 He urged in his\nsermon eleven conclusive arguments against the two popes, for refusing\nto give peace to the church, and ended by requiring the council, in\nconsideration of their obstinate contumacy, to proceed against them and\nprovide a pastor for the flock of God.\n\n\u2018On the 2d day of May, there was a general meeting of the council,\nwhen, after the usual solemnities, a very renowned doctor of Bologna\nmade a reply to the insidious propositions of the bishop of Verdun, on\nthe part of the emperor Robert. He condemned, by arguments drawn from\ndivine, canon, and civil law, all that had been advanced by the bishop;\nand his reasoning was so just and clear that the council were much\nsatisfied and comforted.\n\n\u2018The ensuing Sunday, mass was said before the cardinals, and the sermon\nwas preached by the general of the order of Augustins. He was a great\ndoctor in divinity, and a native of Italy. He chose for his text, \u2018Cum\nvenerit ille arguet mundum de peccato, et de justitia, et de judicio.\u2019\nHe discussed this subject very well, and with a good intent.\n\n\u2018The sittings were prolonged from this 2d of May to the 10th.--The\npatriarch of Alexandria celebrated mass before the cardinals on the\nfeast of the revelation of St Michael, the 8th of May; and he likewise\npreached a sermon, taking for his text, \u2018Congregata est ecclesia ex\nfiliis Israel et omnes qui fugiebant a malis additi sunt, et facti\nsunt illis ad firmamentum.\u2019 These words are written in the 2nd and 5th\nchapters of the first book of Machabees. In the course of this sermon,\nhe pressed six arguments against the two rival popes.\n\n\u2018On Friday, the 10th of May, the council, after the usual solemnities,\nresumed its sittings, when the advocate-fiscal made the following\nrequisitions: that the holy council would be pleased to confirm and\napprove the demands he had before made, namely, that it should declare\nthat the union of the two colleges of cardinals has been and is legal;\nand that the council should pronounce definitively on the other demands\nhe had made. The procurator fiscal made a request to the council, that\neight days should be allowed for the production of witnesses; and the\ncouncil was adjourned to the 16th of May.\n\n\u2018On the Sunday preceding that day, mass was said before the cardinals\nby the bishop of Faenza; and the sermon preached by a native of\nArragon, a learned doctor in divinity, who had always been of the party\nof Pietro della Luna. He chose his text from one of St Paul\u2019s epistles,\n\u2018Expurgate vetus fermentum ut sitis nova conspersio.\u2019 He expatiated on\nthis with such ability that all the doctors wondered. Drawing from it\ncertain conclusions, he said that the two rivals were as much popes\nas his old shoes, calling them worse than Annas and Caiaphas, and\ncomparing them to the devils in hell.\n\n\u2018Such things passed in the council to the 23d day of this present\nmonth, as I have briefly related, on which day the ambassadors from the\nking of Spain were to come to Pisa. The number of prelates that were\npresent cannot be estimated, for they were daily increased by new ones,\nwho came from all parts of Christendom. I should suppose that at the\nlast sitting of the council there were present of cardinals, bishops,\narchbishops, and abbots, wearing mitres, one hundred and forty, without\ncounting the non-mitred members.\n\n\u2018There were also ambassadors from the kings of France, England,\nJerusalem, Sicily, Cyprus, and Poland; from the dukes of Brabant,\nAustria, Stephen of Bavaria, William of Bavaria; from the counts of\nCleves and of Brandac[28]; from the marquis of Brandenbourg and de\nMoraine[29]; from the archbishops of Cologne, Mentz and Saltzbourg, and\nfrom the bishop of Maestricht; from the grand master of the Teutonic\norder; from the patriarch of Aquileia, and from many princes in Italy.\nNumbers of doctors in divinity, and in the canon and civil law, were\npresent, as well from France as from other countries, and very many\nprocurators from divers parts of the world, who, by the grace of God,\nhave held instructive and charitable conversations together from the\ncommencement of the council until this moment.\n\n\u2018In the city of Pisa are abundance of all sorts of provisions, which\nare sold at reasonable prices; but they would be much cheaper, were\nit not for the gabelles and taxes that are levied in these countries.\nIn my mind, Pisa is one of the handsomest cities existing: it has a\nnavigable river, within a league distant, running into the sea,--and\nwhich river brings large vessels, laden with different merchandise, to\nthe town. Around the city are vineyards of white grapes and many fine\nmeadows.\n\n\u2018We are very well lodged, considering the great number of men at\narms quartered in it for its guard. The town has been conquered by\nthe Florentines, who have banished many of the Pisans to prevent any\ntreasons, and sent them to Florence, to the amount of two thousand; and\nthey are obliged to show themselves twice every day to the governor at\nan appointed place, under pain of death.\n\n\u2018Four or five thousand of the Pisans went to ask succour from king\nLancelot[30], who, in compliance with their request, advanced within\nfive leagues of Pisa, with a force of twenty-three thousand combatants,\nas well horse as foot; but the Florentines, through the grace of God,\nare well able to resist all his power, and guard us. True it is, that\nthis king Lancelot ran a risk of losing his kingdom by the union of\nthe holy church, for he had tyrannically seized on a large part of the\npatrimony of St Peter.\n\n\u2018It was said that there were certain ambassadors from Pietro della Luna\nat the council, not with the intent of forwarding the union, but of\nthrowing every obstacle in its way.\n\n\u2018There were nineteen cardinals of both colleges, at this council\nat Pisa, including the cardinal de Challan, whose attendants were\narrived,--and the cardinal was to follow with the ambassadors from\nSavoy.\n\n\u2018My lords the cardinals are much displeased with those bishops,\nabbots, and chapters of cathedral churches, who have neglected to send\nprocurators to this general council. I have nothing more to send to\nyou at present.--Written at Pisa the 15th day of May, by your humble\nmonk and servant, the abbot of St Maxence.\u2019\n\nThe direction was, \u2018To the reverend father in JESUS CHRIST, and by the\ngrace of God, lord bishop of Poitiers, and chancellor to my lord the\nduke of Berry.\u2019\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. IX.\n\n    THE AMBASSADORS TO THE COUNCIL FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF PARIS\n    WRITE LETTERS, TO INFORM THOSE WHO HAD SENT THEM OF WHAT\n    HAD PASSED AT THIS COUNCIL.--PIETRO DELLA LUNA AND GREGORY\n    ARE DEPRIVED OF THE PAPACY, AND ALL PERSONS FORBIDDEN BY\n    THE HOLY COUNCIL FROM OBEYING EITHER IN ANY MANNER.--PETER\n    OF CANDIA, A CORDELIER, IS ELECTED BISHOP OF ROME BY THE\n    CARDINALS.--REGULATIONS FOR THE APPROBATION OF THE GENERAL\n    COUNCIL.\n\n\nI shall now transcribe the letters written by the ambassadors from the\nuniversity of Paris to the council at Pisa, the contents of which are\nas follows.\n\n\u2018Reverend fathers, lords and masters, after offering you our humble\nrecommendation, may it please you to know, that we write to inform you\nof the conclusions entered into by the council-general, which has held\nthirteen sittings.\n\n\u2018The two rival popes, having for some time been waited for in vain,\nnotwithstanding the summons sent them, have been declared contumacious\nin respect to schism and the faith. Many decrees were passed against\nthem for their contumacy, and commissioners were appointed to examine\nwitnesses against them.\n\n\u2018Item, the council-general approved of the union of the colleges of\ncardinals, the citations served on the contending popes, and the place\nof meeting of the council, as being perfectly convenient and secure.\nThe council declared, that it was supreme on earth to take cognizance\nand judge of the charges brought against the contenders for the papacy.\nIt was also declared by the council, that it had been lawful for any\none to quit his obedience to either of the popes, from the moment they\nhad promised to abdicate the papacy; and that all suits and processes,\ncarried on against such as had quitted their obedience to either, were\nannulled and of no weight.\n\n\u2018Public charges were then made against them, and an interlocutory\nsentence passed on the notorious sins of the two competitors. This\nday, doctor Peter Paoul declared, in full council, your opinions,\nand took for his text, \u2018Congregabuntur filii Jud\u00e6 et filii Israel et\nfacient sibimet caput unum.\u2019 That is to say, Those who are come to\nthis council, and such as shall hereafter come, will choose from among\nthemselves a head to the church. A little before this, doctor Dominic\nle Petit had made a solemn harangue before all the cardinals, taking\nfor his text, \u2018Principes populorum congregati sunt cum Deo Abraham.\u2019\nThe cardinals and prelates of the holy church are styled princes of\nthe people. On this day also, the theologians, to the number of six\nscore and three, delivered their opinions, and eighty of them are your\nfriends and supporters.\n\n\u2018Item, this day it has been ordered that the two rival popes be\nsummoned to appear at the doors of the church on Wednesday the 5th of\nJuly, to hear their definitive sentence.\n\n\u2018Gregory has sent a bull to the English to entreat they would be of his\nparty, with Robert king of the Romans, to change the place of holding\nthe council, and that they would please to be of his council; but\nhe labours in vain, for the English, Germans, Bohemians, Polanders,\nFrench, those from Cyprus, Rhodes and Italy, are all unanimous,\nexcepting Robert, whose ambassadors have gone away.\n\n\u2018Few prelates have come to this council from the kingdom of Hungary.\nKing Ladislaus wrote that he intended being here in person, but he is\nfully occupied in his war against the infidels.\n\n\u2018Pietro Mastin, called della Luna, has issued a most thundering bull,\nin which he admonishes the cardinals to return to their duty toward\nhim; and should they refuse, he prohibits them from attempting to\nmake another election, menacing them, in case of disobedience, with\nexcommunication and other penalties against them and their supporters.\n\n\u2018Reverend fathers, and redoubted masters, we have nothing more for the\npresent to write to you, except that all nations seem inclined to a\nreformation in the church, which the new pope, whom it shall please\nGod to elect, will be forced to comply with. Should you have any orders\nto send us, we are ready to obey them to the utmost of our power.\nBeseeching you humbly to keep all our concerns in your consideration,\nmay the Sovereign Lord have you under his guard!\n\n\u2018Written at Pisa the 29th day of May.\u2019 Underneath were signed the\nnames of Dominic le Petit, Pierre Paoul de Quesnoy, Jean Pere Ponce,\nVincent, Eustace de Faquemberge, Arnoul Vibrant, Jean Bourlet, dit\nFran\u00e7ois.--Master Pierre de Poingny and master Guillaume le Charpentier\ndid not sign the above, because they were absent.\n\nHere follows the sentence on the two contending popes.\n\n\u2018This present holy council, assembled in the name of JESUS CHRIST,\nwithdraws itself from the obedience to Pietro della Luna, called Pope\nBenedict XIII. and from Angelo Corrario, called Pope Gregory XII.; and\nthe holy council decrees and declares, that all true Catholics ought to\ndo the same.\n\n\u2018Item, the same holy synod, as representative and judge of the\nuniversal church, after mature consideration and examination of\nwitnesses concerning the horrible sins of the two contending popes,\npronounces, in the church of Pisa, this its definitive sentence, that\nboth popes be deprived of every honour and dignity, especially that of\nthe papacy. It also pronounces, that they be separated from the holy\nchurch, in conformity to the sacred canons, and by the above sentence,\nforbidding all persons to have the boldness ever to defend or obey\neither of them as pope.\n\n\u2018The council forbids any Christians from obeying or showing favour\nto either, notwithstanding any oath or promise they may have made or\nentered into, under pain of excommunication,--and decrees, that whoever\nshall disobey this sentence shall be delivered into the hands of\nsecular justice, and condemned as one who favours heretics, and that he\nshall be punished according to the divine commandments, and the decrees\nof the holy canons.\n\n\u2018The council also declares and pronounces, that all promotions of\ncardinals made by the two rival popes, namely, those made by Angelo\nCorrario since the 3d day of May, and by Pietra della Luna since the\n15th day of June, of the year 1408, have been and are of no effect,\nand are annulled by this definitive sentence. It also declares, that\nevery judgment given by the aforesaid competitors for the papacy, to\nthe prejudice of the holy church, against any kings, princes, lords,\npatriarchs, archbishops, bishops, prelates of the church, or other\nprivate persons, are of no effect; and the holy synod has ordained that\nproceedings to the contrary, and to the welfare of the holy church\nshall commence on the ensuing Monday, the 10th day of June.\u2019\n\nThe above sentences and declarations were passed in the general council\nof Pisa, the 5th day of June, in the year 1409.\n\nThe 26th day of June, in the year 1409, Peter of Candia, a Cordelier\nand native of Greece, doctor of divinity, and usually called the\nCardinal of Milan, was unanimously chosen pope by the cardinals at\nPisa, with the approbation of the general council, and called Alexander\nV. who, immediately after his election, published the following bull.\n\n\u2018Alexander, bishop and servant to the servants of God, to the bishop\nof Paris, health and apostolical benediction. Praise and glory be to\nthe God of heaven for having instilled into the minds of men a desire\nof peace on earth, and who, through his benign grace and mercy, has\nbrought about an union of his Christian people, hitherto long disturbed\nby a dangerous schism.\n\n\u2018Who is there among mankind that will not most heartily rejoice at\nthis happy event, on considering the perils souls must run when such\ndivisions take place in the holy church, and which have for so long a\ntime been encouraged by sacrilegious schismatics?\n\n\u2018Our blessed God, taking pity on his people, who had long suffered\nfrom this division, opened and illuminated the minds of the holy\ngeneral council, who have justly condemned the two popes, according\nto the sacred canons, as enemies to God and his holy church, by their\nenormous, horrible, and notorious sins.\n\n\u2018When our brethren, the venerable Cardinals of the holy roman church,\nof whom we were one, were desirous of finding a proper pastor for the\nChristian flock, after the usual ceremonies and solemnities, with the\nconsent of the council-general, they entered into conclave, where,\nafter long discussions, they unanimously selected our humble self, then\ncardinal-priest of the church of the Twelve Apostles, and chose us\nbishop of Rome. Although we knew our unworthiness of so great a charge,\nconsidering our weakness, yet, always confiding in the aid of God, we\nhave accepted of it.\n\n\u2018Venerable brother, these things we notify to thee, as one loving and\ndesirous of the peace of the church, as we have been well informed;\nand we exhort thee and thy flock to render thanks to the all-powerful\nGod for this most gracious gift which he has granted to us. We have so\ngreat an affection for thy worthy person, that we inform thee, that we\nare ready to serve thee and thine to the utmost of our power.--This\npresent letter we have intrusted to be delivered to thee by our\nwell-beloved son, that notable man Paulin d\u2019Arc\u00e9, esquire of honour,\nchamberlain, and our loyal servant.--Given at Pisa the 8th day of July,\nin the first year of our papacy.\u2019\n\nIt is the good pleasure of our very sacred lord Alexander V. by divine\nProvidence, pope, that all promotions, translations, confirmations and\ncollations whatever, and all consecrations of bishops and others, that\nhave been granted or performed by the two competitors for the papacy,\nshall be considered as strictly legal, provided they were effected\nprior to passing of the definitive sentence, and done according to the\nregulations of the canon law.\n\nItem, it is also the pleasure of the general council, that our\naforesaid lord shall give his orders concerning the archbishop of Genoa.\n\nItem, the benefices in the church, that had been given by ordinary\njudges, have the approbation of the holy council to continue to them to\nwhom they have been given.\n\nItem, the holy council approves of proceedings being instituted against\nall who shall obstinately obey or favour either of the late competitors\nfor the papacy, Pietro della Luna or Angelo Corrario,--and the council\ncondemns such, as guilty of schism and notorious heresy, and ordains\nthat they be punished according to the regulations of the sacred canons.\n\nItem, it is ordered, that should the cardinal de Flisque[31] be willing\nto return to his duty, and appear personally within two months, he\nshall be kindly received, and enjoy all his honours and benefices,\nwhich he obtained in the year 1408.\n\nItem, all dispensations given by bishops of dioceses in those parts\nnot obedient to the two competitors, in the cases of persons not being\nof sufficient age to obtain dignities in the church or benefices,--and\nall absolutions, and acts of penitence, ordained by the competitors\nduring the schism, shall be reserved to the determination of the holy\napostolic see. All of which has been approved of and certified by the\nholy council.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. X.\n\n    THE DEATH OF THE BISHOP OF PARIS.----THE MARRIAGES, OF THE\n    DUKE OF BRABANT WITH THE NIECE OF THE KING OF BOHEMIA,--OF THE\n    CONSTABLE OF FRANCE\u2019S DAUGHTER WITH THE SON OF MONTAGU, GRAND\n    MASTER OF THE HOUSEHOLD,--OF THE KING OF CYPRUS WITH CHARLOTTE\n    DE BOURBON.\n\n\nIn these days, the lord John d\u2019Orgemont, bishop of Paris, departed this\nlife, in his episcopal palace, about the end of June. He was succeeded\nin his bishoprick by the lord Gerard de Montagu, bishop of Poitiers,\nchancellor to the duke of Berry, and brother to the grand master of\nthe king\u2019s household and to the archbishop of Sens. He was honourably\nreceived in the cathedral church of N\u00f4tre Dame in Paris, the 22d day of\nSeptember following.\n\nThe king of France, the dukes of Berry, Burgundy, and Bourbon, the king\nof Navarre, and several other princes, with prelates and churchmen\nwithout number, were present at his consecration. With the aid of the\ngrand master, his brother, the feast he gave on the occasion was the\nmost magnificent ever seen, in regard to the quantity of gold and\nsilver plate, and the diversity and abundance of meats and liquors.\nFrom this grand display, the princes observed that the grand master\ngoverned the king as he pleased; and they began to form suspicions as\nto the uprightness of his conduct.\n\nOn the 16th day of July following, duke Anthony of Brabant married, at\nBrussels, the niece of the king of Bohemia[32], heiress to the duchy\nof Luxembourg in right of her father. This marriage had been concluded\nby the mediation of the bishop of Ch\u00e2lons and sir Regnier Pot.\n\nSeveral knights, esquires, ladies and damsels of high rank, had\naccompanied the lady to Brussels, according to the orders of the king\nof Bohemia, her uncle. There were present at these nuptials the two\nbrothers of the duke of Brabant, the duke of Burgundy and the count de\nNevers, with their sister, wife to duke William count de Hainault; the\ncount de Charolois and the countess of Cleves, children to the duke of\nBurgundy; the marquis du Pont, his brother John[33] and their sister,\nthe countess de St Pol[34], all three children to the duke de Bar; the\ncounts de Namur and de Conversant, with their ladies, with many more of\nthe great nobility of both sexes.\n\nThe count de Clermont, son to the duke de Bourbon, was also there,--and\nwhen he tilted was attended by the duke of Burgundy and count de\nNevers. The duke bore his shield and the count his lance, to the\nsurprise of many present, on account of the great hatred that had so\nlately subsisted between them for the murder of the duke of Orleans:\nhowever, they seemed then to be in perfect concord. This feast was\nabundantly served with all sorts of provisions and wines,--and when it\nwas ended, the different guests retired to their respective countries.\n\nOn the last day but one of the same month of July, the marriage of the\ndaughter of the lord d\u2019Albret, constable of France, with the eldest\nson of Montagu[35], grand master of the king\u2019s household, was solemnly\ncelebrated. The queen of France and numbers of the great nobles were\npresent,--and the whole of the expense was paid by the king, which\ncreated much anger and envy in several of the princes of the blood\nagainst Montagu.\n\nAt this time, the truces were broken between the kings of France and of\nEngland, but only at sea; and a bitter naval war ensued, to the great\nloss of many merchants in each country.\n\nOn the 2d day of August, John de Lusignan, king of Cyprus, espoused by\nproxy, Charlotte de Bourbon, sister-german to the count de la Marche.\nThe ceremony was performed in the castle of Melun, in the presence of\nthe queen of France, the duke of Acquitaine and her other children,\nthe king of Navarre, the dukes of Berry and of Bourbon, the counts de\nla Marche and de Clermont, the lord Louis de Baviere, brother to the\nqueen, and many ladies and damsels, who greatly amused themselves in\ntournaments, dances, in feastings and other pastimes.\n\nThe lady Charlotte, queen of Cyprus, was very handsome, and well\nendowed with noble and gracious manners. On the conclusion of these\nfeasts, she departed for Cyprus, most honourably accompanied by the\nnobles so ordered by her brother, and also by those who had been sent\nto her from the king of Cyprus. She landed at the port of Chermes,\nwhither the king came to meet her, much rejoiced at her safe arrival,\nand conducted her, attended by the greater part of the nobility of\nthe island, to Nicosia, where were made many feasts, according to the\ncustom of the country. They reigned for a long time with much honour,\nand had two children, of whom more shall be spoken hereafter.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XI.\n\n    THE DUKE OF BURGUNDY HOLDS A GREAT COUNCIL AT LILLE ON HIS\n    AFFAIRS.--THE DEATH OF THE DUCHESS OF ORLEANS.\n\n\nOn the 5th of August, and the eight succeeding days, duke John of\nBurgundy held a grand council in his town of Lille, on his own affairs,\nand on the means of reconciling his brother and brother-in-law, the\nduke of Brabant and duke William of Holland, who had quarrelled for a\ncause before mentioned.\n\nWith these two dukes, there were also present the duke of Burgundy\u2019s\nsister, the wife of duke William, the bishop of Liege, and the count\nde Namur. At length, the duke of Burgundy made peace between them, on\ncondition that duke William should pay to the duke of Brabant, for all\nhis demand of debt, the sum of seventy thousand golden florins of the\ncoin of France, by different instalments.\n\nWhen this had been settled, the duke of Burgundy went, about the\nmiddle of August, to Paris, by orders from the king and royal council:\nhe was accompanied by many men at arms, whom he quartered in the\nvillages round Paris. The reason why he was attended by such a force\nwas, because the duke of Brittany had lately brought from England\ngreat numbers of English, and, in conjunction with his Bretons, was\ncarrying on a sharp war against the old countess of Penthievre[36]\nand her lands. The queen of France and the king\u2019s ministers were much\ndispleased at this conduct of the duke of Brittany, because it was to\nthe prejudice of the realm. The duke had increased this displeasure\nagainst him by having beaten and ill treated his duchess, daughter to\nthe king of France, for blaming him on account of his undertaking this\nwar.\n\nIt was therefore intended, that the duke of Burgundy should march the\nforces he had brought, attended by other princes and captains, against\nthe duke of Brittany, to conquer his country and oblige him to submit\nto the king. The duke of Burgundy was very desirous of succouring\nthe countess and her fair son, the count de Penthievre; but while the\npreparations were making, the duke of Brittany, informed by some of\nhis friends that he was in the ill graces of his mother in law, the\nqueen of France, and of those who governed the king, sent, by advice\nof his council, certain ambassadors to Paris, to offer to submit his\ndifferences with the countess de Penthievre to the king and council,\nwhich was at length accepted, through the interference of the king of\nNavarre.\n\nThe countess de Penthievre and her son were summoned to Paris, whither\nalso came the duke of Brittany, when, after some discussions, peace was\nmade between them.\n\nIn this same month, Isabella, the king of France\u2019s eldest daughter, and\ndowager queen of England, but wife to Charles duke of Orleans, died\nin childbed. The duke bitterly lamented her loss, but received some\nconsolation out of regard to the daughter she had brought him.\n\nThe patriarch of Alexandria, bishop of Carcassonne, succeeded Guy de\nRoye (whose murder has been noticed) in the archbishoprick of Rheims,\nand the archbishop of Bourges succeeded to the patriarchate. Doctor\nWilliam Bouratier, secretary to the king, was nominated archbishop\nof Bourges; and nearly about this time died doctor Peter Paoul, and\nwas succeeded in his dignities by doctor Gilles des Champs, almoner\nto the king. Louis de Harcourt, brother to the count de Harcourt, was\nappointed archbishop of Rouen.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XII.\n\n    THE TOWN OF GENOA REBELS AGAINST BOUCICAUT, MARSHAL OF FRANCE,\n    THE GOVERNOR, WHILE OBEYING A SUMMONS FROM THE DUKE OF MILAN.\n\n\nBoucicaut, marshal of France, was at this time governor of Genoa, and\nresided there. He was called upon by the duke of Milan and his brother,\nthe count of Pavia[37], to settle a dispute which had arisen between\nthem, respecting part of their dominions. He accepted the invitation,\nthinking he should do an agreeable service to the duke of Milan, and\nnot suspecting any trick in the matter. But during his absence, the\ninhabitants of Genoa rebelled against his government, and sent for some\nof their allies and accomplices to come to them.\n\nThey cruelly murdered the marshal\u2019s lieutenant, the chevalier de\nColletrie, named Chollette, a native of Auvergne, which the other\nFrenchmen hearing of, fled into the forts, for fear of suffering a\nsimilar fate. These were instantly besieged by the Genoese, who sent\nfor the marquis of Montferrat[38]: he lost no time in hastening to\ntheir aid with four thousand combatants, as they had promised to pay\nhim ten thousand florins yearly,--and they immediately elected him doge\nof Genoa. They also chose twelve knights, as a council to manage public\naffairs.\n\nA few days after, Fassincault[39], a very renowned captain in Italy,\nand a great friend of the marquis of Montferrat, came to Genoa with\nthe intent of assisting the marquis; but the Genoese refused to admit\nhim, or accept of his offers. On his return, his force, amounting\nto eight thousand men, took a town called Noefville; but the French\nretreated within the castle, which was instantly besieged.\n\nWhen Boucicaut heard of the rebellion of the Genoese, he set out\naccompanied by his men, and the duke of Milan and the count of Pavia,\nand arrived with speed at the castle of Gaing[40], situated between the\ntown of Noefville[41] and Genoa, and fought with Fassincault and his\nforces. In this battle, eight hundred men were slain, the greater part\nbelonging to Fassincault,--and night alone separated the combatants.\n\nBoucicaut, by the advice of Enguerrand de Bournouville and Gaiffier\nde la Salle, both men at arms of acknowledged prowess, advanced that\nnight to the castle of Gaing, which he won, and amply provided it with\nprovision and all necessary stores. Fassincault remained in the town;\nbut seeing he could not gain the castle, he departed with his men to\nhis own fortresses.\n\nThe marshal Boucicaut carried on a severe warfare against the Genoese\nand those who had assisted them. He also sent messengers to inform\nthe king of France of his situation, and to require that he would\nimmediately send him reinforcements of men at arms.--The king and his\ngreat council, on receiving this intelligence and considering the\nfickleness of the Genoese, determined to proceed cautiously against\nthem. The king sent, at his expense, the lords de Torsy, de Rambures,\nand de Viefville, with a certain number of men at arms, to the city of\nAsti, belonging to the duke of Orleans, and near to the territory of\nGenoa, with the hope of affording assistance to Boucicaut.\n\nOn their arrival at Asti, they found that the whole country was in\nrebellion, excepting some forts, which held out for the French; but as\nthey were without the town, and could not contain many men, from dread\nof wanting provision, they were not of consequence, nor could they do\nmuch mischief. The above knights, therefore, perceiving they could not\nperform any essential services, resolved to return to France.\n\nAll merchants, and others who came from or had any connexions with\nGenoa, were now sought after in Paris, arrested and imprisoned, and\ntheir goods confiscated to the king\u2019s use. Now these Genoese had for a\nlong time been under obedience to the king, and had diligently served\nhim in many of his wars.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XIII.\n\n    THE PRINCES OF THE BLOOD ASSEMBLE, AND RESOLVE TO REFORM THE\n    MANAGEMENT OF THE ROYAL FINANCES.--THE DEATH OF MONTAGU.\n\n\nAt this period, the following princes of the blood,--Louis king of\nNavarre[42], the dukes of Berry, Burgundy, and Bourbon, and many other\ngreat lords, were at Paris; and having learnt that the king\u2019s treasury\nwas impoverished by his officers and those who governed him, insomuch\nthat his plate and the greater part of his jewels were in pawn, they\none day personally explained to the king, in the presence of the queen,\nthe duke of Acquitaine and others of his council, the miserable state\nof his finances, and the unworthy government of the officers of his\nhousehold. They at the same time requested, that he would be pleased\nto permit that some of them should have power to reform in general the\nabuses that had commenced with his reign, and to call to an account,\ndismiss, and punish all who should have mismanaged the finances,\naccording as the cases might require, without any exception whatever.\n\nThis request the king granted; and for the better carrying on their\nobject, the greater part of the lords before mentioned left their\nown h\u00f4tels, and resided in the king\u2019s palace of St Pol, where, with\nthe advice of the members of the parliament and the university, they\ncontinued their reformations for many days.\n\nThey soon discovered that those who had managed the finances for the\nlast sixteen or twenty years had very dishonestly acquitted themselves,\nand had acquired for themselves and their friends immense fortunes,\nto the prejudice of the state. Montagu, who had been the principal\nminister of finance, was particularly the object they aimed at,--and\nthey ordered him, with several others, to be arrested and confined in\nthe prisons of the Ch\u00e2telet.\n\nSir Peter des Essars, provost of Paris, was directed to put this order\ninto execution, with his sergeants; and by the command of the duke of\nBurgundy, the lords de Heylly, de Robais, and sir Roland de Vequerque,\nwere appointed to assist the provost in this duty. Having assembled\ntogether, they, on a certain day, met Montagu, and with him the doctor,\nMartin Gouge, bishop of Chartres, both going to hear mass at the\nmonastery of St Victor.\n\nThe provost, attended by the above lords, on meeting them, laid his\nhands on both, saying, \u2018I lay hands on you by virtue of the royal\nauthority vested in me for this purpose.\u2019--Montagu, hearing these\nwords, was much astonished, and trembled greatly; but his courage soon\nreturned, and he replied to the provost, \u2018What! rascal, art thou daring\nenough to lay hands on me?\u2019 But the provost answered, \u2018Matters will\nnot turn out as you think,--for you must make reparation for the many\nand great mischiefs you have done.\u2019\n\nMontagu, unable to resist, was tightly bound by the provost, and\ncarried by him straight to the little Ch\u00e2telet. The bishop of Chartres\nwas arrested with him, as he had been president of one of the financial\ndepartments. Montagu was several times put to the torture, insomuch\nthat, suspecting his end was approaching, he asked his confessor what\nhe had best do: the confessor replied, \u2018I see no other remedy than your\nappealing from the jurisdiction of the provost of Paris.\u2019 This he did;\nand the provost waited on the lords who had commanded him to arrest\nMontagu, to inform them, that he had appealed against his jurisdiction.\nThe parliament was consequently convoked to examine into the matter;\nand the members of it declared the appeal of no effect. The lords,\ntherefore, seeing the cause had been judged, said to the provost, \u2018Go,\nwithout delay, accompanied by some of the populace well armed, take thy\nprisoner, and finish the matter by cutting off his head with an axe,\nand fix it on a lance in the market-place.\u2019\n\nAfter these words, the populace armed themselves, and, on the 17th\nof October, assembled in bodies in the place Maubert, and in other\nparts of the town. They carried Montagu to a scaffold erected in the\nmarket place, where, having made him strip to his shirt, they cut off\nhis head, and fixed it to the end of a pike, and hung his body by the\nshoulders to the highest gibbet at Montfaucon. This execution was\nchiefly owing, as it was said, to the duke of Burgundy\u2019s hatred to him,\nwho even sent for a very great number of the nobles of his countries of\nBurgundy, Flanders, and Artois, to be spectators of it.\n\nA little before this execution took place, the duke of Bourbon, and\nhis son the count de Clermont, left Paris, indignant at the arrest of\nMontagu. The duke of Orleans, his brothers, and all of their party,\nwere also very much displeased that he was put to death,--but they\ncould not help it, for at that time they were not listened to by the\nking\u2019s council.\n\nOn the morrow of this event, duke William count of Hainault arrived at\nParis, having been sent for by the duke of Burgundy. A large company of\nthe nobles went out of the town to meet him; and he was most graciously\nreceived by the king, the duke of Acquitaine and the other princes. On\nhis arrival, the h\u00f4tel that had belonged to Montagu was given to him,\nwith all its furniture, for it had been confiscated to the king\u2019s use;\nand duke William took instant possession.\n\nThe castle of Marcoussi, which had been built by Montagu, was seized\nby the king: it is situated seven leagues from Paris, on the road to\nChartres. Montagu was born in Paris, and had first been secretary\nto the king: he was the son of Gerard de Montagu, who had also been\nsecretary to Charles V. He was of noble birth by his mother\u2019s side, and\nhad three daughters, two of whom were married; the elder to John[43]\ncount de Roussy, the second to Peter de Craon, lord of Montbason;\nand the third was betrothed to John de Melun, son to the lord\nd\u2019Antoing[44], but the match was broken off: his son was married to the\ndaughter of the lord d\u2019Albret, constable of France and cousin to the\nking, as has been related.\n\nAfter this, the provost of Paris arrested many of the king\u2019s officers,\nparticularly those who had been concerned in the finances and in\nmatters of revenue. All the principals in the department of the\ngeneralities, the presidents and others of the chamber of accounts,\nPerrin Pillot, a merchant, with several others, were imprisoned in the\nLouvre and in other places of confinement.\n\nWhen the borgne de Foucal, equerry to the king, and keeper of that\ndepartment of the treasury called the Epargne, heard that the grand\nmaster of the household was arrested, he was greatly astonished and\ntroubled, and, instantly changing his dress, mounted a fleet horse, and\nsecretly left Paris. This caused him to be much suspected of improper\nconduct by the princes who were examining into these matters.\n\nAt this period, the archbishop of Sens, brother to the grand master,\nGuichart Daulphin, William de Tignonville, knights, and master Goutier\nCol, secretary to the king, were sent, by orders from the king, to meet\nthe english ambassadors at Amiens. The archbishop, hearing of the\narrest and imprisonment of his brother, took leave of his companions,\nand set out from Amiens: but as he was journeying toward Paris, he was\nmet by one of the king\u2019s ushers, who made him his prisoner; for he had\norders so to do from the king, and confine him at Amiens, should he\nchance to find him there.\n\nThe archbishop very prudently replied, that he was ready to follow him\nto prison or to death; but when they came to the river Oise, near the\npriory of St Leu de Cherens, he played the usher a trick. On leaving\nthe ferry boat with a few of his people, he mounted the fleetest of his\nhorses, and galloped off, leaving the usher on the other side waiting\nfor the return of the ferry-boat; but, thunderstruck at his being so\ncheated, he returned to Paris without his prisoner.\n\nThe lord de Tignonville, having been a member of the chamber of\naccounts, was, by command of the princes, arrested by the bailiff of\nAmiens, and confined in his prison. But after a short time, he, the\nbishop of Chartres, and the other prisoners at Paris, were suspended\nfrom their offices, and, having given bail, were permitted to go about\nParis, or wherever they pleased.\n\nThe princes, not being able to attend sufficiently to these matters\nof reform from their other occupations of greater weight, appointed\na commission to examine carefully into them, which commission was\ncomposed of the counts de la Marche, de Vend\u00f4me and de St Pol, with\nsome members of the parliament.\n\nThe men at arms that had been called together round Paris by the duke\nof Burgundy and others were disbanded; and each, as they returned to\nthe places whence they had come, devoured the substance of the poor\npeople, according to the custom of that time.\n\nSir Guichart Daulphin[45], before mentioned, was, by the princes,\nappointed grand master of the king\u2019s household in the room of the\nmurdered Montagu; for the king was then troubled with his usual\ndisorder.\n\nThe bishop of Paris now requested of the princes, that they would, in\ntheir mercy, permit him to have the body of his brother taken down from\nthe gibbet, and, with many tears and supplications, petitioned for\nleave to bury him. But neither of these requests was granted him by the\nprinces; on which the bishop, ashamed of the disgraceful death of one\nbrother and the flight of another, the archbishop of Sens, soon after\nquitted his see, and taking with him his sister-in-law, the widow of\nMontagu, and some of their children, for the duke of Berry had already\nappointed another chancellor, went to the estate of his sister-in-law\nin Savoy: she was the daughter of sir Stephen de la Grange, formerly\npresident of the parliament, and brother to the cardinal d\u2019Amiens.\n\nThe borgne de Foucal, not answering to the proclamations that were\nmade for his appearance, was banished the realm of France, by sound\nof trumpet in the four quarters of Paris. In like manner were the\narchbishop of Sens and many other fugitives banished the kingdom.\n\nThe king of Navarre, the dukes of Berry, Burgundy and Holland, with the\ncounts de Vend\u00f4me and de la Marche, and several great lords, waited on\nthe queen of France and the duke of Acquitaine, to make them acquainted\nwith the reasons for the executing Montagu, and what progress they had\nmade in the reformation of abuses, and the measures they had pursued\nagainst such as were criminal. The queen testified her satisfaction,\nand was contented that they should proceed as they had began. She was,\nhowever, far from being pleased with the duke of Burgundy, whom she\ndreaded, from the great power he was now possessed of, more than any of\nthe other princes, although he treated her respectfully in his speech.\n\nThe marriage of the lord Louis of Bavaria, brother to the queen, was\nagain talked of with the daughter of the king of Navarre; and he was\npresented with the castle of Marcoussi, with all its furniture and\nappurtenances, which had lately been confiscated to the king, by the\ndeath of Montagu, which was very agreeable to the queen.\n\nAfter these lords had for some days transacted business at Melun, where\nthe court was, they all returned to Paris, carrying with them master\nPeter Bosthet, president of the parliament, and some members of the\nchamber of accounts, and assembled daily to inquire after those persons\nwho had been in the receipt and expenditure of the public revenues.\n\nDuring this time, the king, who had been very ill, was restored\nto health, insomuch that on the 2d day of December, he rode from\nhis palace of St Pol, dressed in a hauberk under his robes, to the\ncathedral church of N\u00f4tre Dame, where he made his prayers, a page\ncarrying behind him a very handsome steel helmet and a moorish lance.\nHaving finished his prayers, he returned to his palace of Saint Pol.\n\nOn the morrow, he held a royal council in person, at which were present\nthe king of Navarre, the dukes of Berry, Burgundy, and of Bourbon,\nwhich last was lately returned to Paris. It was there resolved, that\nthe king should summon the following lords to attend him personally\nat the ensuing feast of Christmas, namely, the dukes of Orleans, of\nBrittany, of Brabant, of Bar, and of Lorraine: the counts of Savoy[46],\nof Alen\u00e7on, of Penthievre, of Namur, of Harcourt, of Armagnac[47],\nand in general all the great lords within his realm of France and\nDauphiny, with many prelates and other noblemen. After this summons of\nthe king, the duke of Burgundy gave orders for a large body of men at\narms to be collected in his countries of Flanders, Artois and Burgundy,\nfor the safety of his person.\n\nShortly after this council, duke William count of Hainault went to\nMelun, the residence of the queen of France, who was his near relation;\nand so managed that she, who could not bear the duke of Burgundy, and\nhad strongly supported the party adverse to him, namely, that of my\nlord the duke of Orleans, was reconciled to him.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XIV.\n\n    DUKE LOUIS OF BAVARIA ESPOUSES THE DAUGHTER OF THE KING OF\n    NAVARRE.--THE NAMES OF THE LORDS WHO CAME TO PARIS IN OBEDIENCE\n    TO THE KING\u2019S ORDERS.\n\n\nAbout this time, duke Louis of Bavaria was married at Melun to the\ndaughter of the king of Navarre, according to what has been before\nmentioned. She had previously married the eldest son of the king of\nArragon[48], who had lately been slain in a battle between him and the\nviscount de Narbonne and the Sardinians, which took place in Sardinia.\nThere was much feasting at this wedding, which was attended by many\nlords, ladies and damsels.\n\nAbout Christmas the greater part of those lords whom the king had\nsummoned, arrived at Paris: the duke of Orleans and his brothers,\nhowever, did not come. On the eve of Christmas-day, the king went to\nthe palace to hold his state, and remained there until St Thomas\u2019s day,\nwhere he celebrated most solemnly the feast of the nativity of our Lord.\n\nOn this day the following persons were seated at the king\u2019s table at\ndinner: on his right, doctor William Bouratier, archbishop of Bourges,\nwho had said the mass, next to him was the cardinal de Bar. The king\nwas seated at the middle of the table, very magnificently dressed in\nhis royal robes. On his left were the dukes of Berry and Burgundy. A\ngreat variety of ornamental plate was produced in gold and silver,\nwhich were wont to be served before the king on high feasts, but which\nhad not for some time been seen, because they had been pawned to\nMontagu, and had been found after his death in his castle of Marcoussi,\nand in other places where he had hidden them.\n\nBy orders from the princes of the blood they had been replaced, as\nusual, in the king\u2019s palace, which was a very agreeable sight to the\nnobles and people of Paris, from their regard to the honour of the\nking\u2019s person, and his royal state.\n\nA great many princes and others had obeyed the king\u2019s summons, and\nwere at this feast,--namely, the king of Navarre, the dukes of Berry,\nBurgundy, Bourbon, Brabant, duke William count of Hainault, the duke of\nLorraine, duke Louis of Bavaria, brother to the queen,--and nineteen\ncounts, namely, the count de Mortain, brother to the king of Navarre,\nthe count de Nevers, the count de Clermont, the marquis du Pont, son\nto the duke of Bar, the count de Vaudemont, the count d\u2019Alen\u00e7on, the\ncount de Vend\u00f4me, the count de Penthievre, the count de St Pol, the\ncount de Cleves, the count de Tancarville, the count d\u2019Angy[49], the\ncount de Namur, and several others, to the aforesaid amount. The number\nof knights who accompanied these princes was so great that, from the\nreport of the heralds, they were more than eighteen hundred knights,\nwithout including esquires.\n\nNevertheless, there were not in this noble company the duke of Orleans\nnor his brothers, nor the duke of Brittany, nor the lord d\u2019Albret,\nconstable of France, nor the counts de Foix, d\u2019Armagnac, and many other\npotent lords, although they had been summoned by the king in like\nmanner as the others.\n\nOn St Thomas\u2019s day, after the king had feasted his nobles in royal\nstate, the queen, by orders from the king, came from the castle of\nVincennes to Paris. All the princes, prelates, and great crowds of\npeople, went out to meet her and her son, the duke of Acquitaine, and\nconducted her to the palace, where they presented her to the king, in\nthe presence of all the before-mentioned lords. Her son had visited\nhis government, to be properly instructed in arms, and other necessary\nmatters, that he might be the better qualified to rule his kingdom when\nit should fall to him.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XV.\n\n    THE KING OF FRANCE KEEPS ROYAL STATE IN HIS PALACE, WHEREIN\n    SEVERAL OF THE GREAT LORDS BEFORE MENTIONED HOLD MANY COUNCILS\n    ON THE STATE OF THE NATION.\n\n\nIn consequence of several meetings having been held in the presence of\nthe king, queen, and duke of Acquitaine, the king ordered the great\nhall of the palace to be magnificently prepared for a royal sessions.\nThither were summoned all the principal noblemen, prelates and others,\nwhen the king appeared seated in his regal robes. On one side of him\nwere the king of Navarre and the cardinal de Bar, and on the other\nthe duke of Acquitaine, the duke of Berry, and all the other princes\nand nobles, each seated according to his rank: in like manner were\nthe prelates, knights, and clergy, and a multitude of others, seated\naccording to their respective situations in life.\n\nThen, by the king\u2019s commands, the count de Tancarville, an able and\neloquent man, harangued with a loud and clear voice, how Richard\nlate king of England, and son-in-law to the king, had been basely and\ntreacherously put to death, during the time of a truce, by Henry of\nLancaster, calling himself king of England, but then earl of Derby, in\nconjunction with his partisans, as might be fully proved by several of\nthe English, near relations of the deceased king Richard:--And also how\nthe young prince of Scotland, an ally to the king, when on his voyage\nto France, was taken by this same Henry, and detained his prisoner for\na long time; as were likewise many Scots, who were in the company of\nthe prince of Wales. Yvain Graindos[50], with several of his Welshmen,\nallies also to the king, notwithstanding the aforesaid truce, were by\nthe English harrassed with war. The eldest son likewise to the prince\nof Wales was made captive[51], carried to England, and imprisoned by\nHenry for a considerable time.\n\n\u2018In consequence of the facts above stated, the king thinks he may,\nwithout further consideration, lawfully wage war against the said\nHenry and his english subjects, without giving them any respite.\nNotwithstanding this,\u2019 continued the orator, \u2018the king is desirous that\nwhatever he may please to order should be for the common welfare of the\nstate; and for this purpose a royal sessions has been held, for every\none to consider these matters and what ought to be the line of conduct\nfor him to pursue,--and, having an opinion thereon, if they will inform\nthe king or his council thereof, the king will thank them and follow\nthat advice which shall seem to him the most advantageous for the\ngeneral good.\n\nUpon this, the eldest of the princes of the blood, namely, the king\u2019s\nuncle the duke of Berry, arose from his seat, and, advancing in front\nof the king\u2019s throne, fell on his knees, and, speaking for himself and\nthe other princes of the blood, declared they would relinquish, to the\nuse of the state, all taxes and impositions which they annually levied\non their lands,--and in like manner would they relinquish all the fees\nand perquisites of office which they were in the habit of receiving\nfrom their places under the king, and as the members of his council.\n\nThe king kindly listened to the duke\u2019s speech, and accepted his offers,\nand then commanded him to be reseated. The lord Tancarville continued\nhis harangue, saying, that the king, then present, revoked all pensions\nand grants which he had given, and thus publicly annulled them. In\nregard to the reformation and future management of the finances, the\nking declared his intention that such regulations as should be ordered\nby himself, and by the advice of the count de la Marche (who had now\nlost his wife, the daughter of the king of Navarre), his brother the\ncount de Vend\u00f4me, the count de Saint Pol, and the other commissioners\nfrom the parliament, should be fully executed without excepting any\nperson whatever; and that the reformations by them proposed should take\nplace, as well in the chambers of accounts as in the generalities and\nin the household of the king,--and that all receivers, comptrollers,\nand all persons any way interested in the management of the finances\nof the realm, whether bishops or archbishops, and of what rank soever,\nshould be subjected to them.\u2019 The orator continued,--\u2018That the king\nwilled and ordered, that during his absence, the queen should call\nto her assistance some of the princes of the royal blood, and should\ngovern the affairs of this kingdom according as she might judge most\nconducive to its welfare; and in case of the absence of the queen, the\nduke of Acquitaine, his son, then present, should govern the kingdom,\nwith the assistance of the dukes of Berry and Burgundy.\u2019\n\nWhen the lord de Tancarville had more fully enlarged on the above\nmatters, and concluded his speech, the king descended from his royal\nthrone, and, with a small company, entered his apartment to dinner; and\nthe whole assembly broke up, and departed to their h\u00f4tels.\n\nAfter the dinner, the queen set out with her attendants for the castle\nof Vincennes, as it was the eve of the feast of the Circumcision, but\nleft her son with the king. On the morrow, the feast-day, the duke of\nBurgundy (who had alone more princes, knights, and gentlemen attached\nto him than all the other princes together,) gave presents of jewels\nand rich gifts, of greater magnificence than any one, according to the\ncustom of that day. He made presents to all the knights and nobles of\nhis household, to the amount, as was estimated, of fifteen thousand\ngolden florins, of medals formed like to a mason\u2019s level, of gold and\nsilver gilt; and at the pointed ends of these levels was fastened a\nsmall gilt chain, with a plummet of gold, so that it might be used as a\nrule.\n\nItem, on Twelfth-day following, Louis king of Sicily, having been sent\nfor by the king, entered Paris. He came from the city of Pisa, whither\nhe had gone to visit pope Alexander V. and made his entry, attended by\nnumbers of the nobility and clergy, who had gone out to meet him.\n\nShortly after, the cardinal de Thurey came to Paris, as ambassador from\nthe pope to the king, who most honourably received him, as he likewise\ndid Philibert de Lignac, grand master of Rhodes, and chief of the order\nof St John of Jerusalem, who had come from England.\n\nThe king now disbanded all the troops he had collected, as did the duke\nof Burgundy, excepting about one hundred or six score gentlemen, whom\nhe retained, with those of his household, to guard his person: the\nothers returned to their homes.\n\nBefore the duke of Burgundy left Paris, the duke of Acquitaine, with\nthe consent of the king and queen, was intrusted to his care and\nguardianship, that he might be properly instructed in the arts of war\nand government. He had been very anxious to obtain this, and had caused\nseveral of the princes of the blood to press the matter: even his\nuncle, the duke of Berry, had, on this account, more than once refused\nthe queen to accept of the guardianship of the duke of Acquitaine;\nbut had so urged the business that the lord de Dolhaing[52], knight,\nhis principal esquire, counsellor and advocate, had, by the earnest\ndesire of the queen, been made chancellor to the duke of Acquitaine,\nand the lord de Saint George his first chamberlain. The government\nof the castles of Crotoy and Beaurain-sur-Canche were granted to the\nduke of Berry for his life, on giving the preceding governors the\nusual pension, in whose room he appointed two of his own knights; the\nlord de Croy to Crotoy, and the lord de Humbercourt to Beaurain; and\nsir Reginald Pot was, at his request, appointed governor of Dauphiny\nfor the dauphin. Soon after this, the king relapsed into his usual\ndisorder, and was put under good guard. Those who were intrusted with\nthe reform of abuses continued daily at work, and with such success\nthat large sums were recovered from the late directors of the finances.\n\nAt this period, the princes and council of state went often to the\ncastle of Vincennes, where the queen resided,--for without her\nknowledge no business of any importance was carried on. The dukes of\nBerry and Bourbon, however, were much discontented that they were not\nso often summoned to the council as before, and that their authority\nwas greatly lessened. Seeing themselves, as it were, banished from the\ngovernment, they took leave of the king, queen, and princes, and each\nretired to his own domains.\n\nThe cardinal de Thurey had come to Paris to solicit the university\nand council of state to consent that pope Alexander might levy\ntwo-tenths on the gallican church, to defray the great expenses he was\nbound to pay. This request was not granted, because the university\nopposed it, in the name of the whole church. The better to effect\nthis, the university required and obtained a royal mandate, to\ncommand all officers under the crown forcibly to send out of their\njurisdictions all persons who should come thither making similar\ndemands. The solicitors of this levy had brought to Paris with them\na bull containing many novelties, which were not usually advanced,\nnamely, that the tythes, and other things, such as oblations to the\nchurch, belonged to them in preference to the parochial clergy, for\nthat in fact they were in the same capacity, inasmuch as whoever should\nconfess themselves to them were not under the necessity of so doing to\ntheir own clergyman. This doctrine they publicly preached throughout\nParis, and the members of the university preached in opposition to it,\nso that during Lent the whole town was in confusion and discord by\nthese quarrels of the university and the mendicants, until they were\ndriven out of it by the university. The Jacobins, however, as the most\nprudent, renounced the bull, and made oath that they would never claim\nany advantages from it, nor from other privileges that had been granted\nto them. By this means, they were reconciled to the university. The\npope, at this period, held his court with great state in Bologna la\nGrassa.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XVI.\n\n    A GREAT DISSENSION TAKES PLACE THIS YEAR BETWEEN THE KING OF\n    POLAND, ON THE ONE HAND, AND THE GRAND MASTER OF PRUSSIA AND\n    HIS KNIGHTS ON THE OTHER.\n\n\nThis year, a great quarrel arose between the king of Poland and the\ngrand master of the Teutonic order in Prussia; and the king assembled a\nlarge force from different nations, which he marched into Prussia, with\nthe intent to destroy it.\n\nThe grand master and his brethren soon made themselves ready to meet\nhim with a great army, and showed every inclination to give him battle;\nbut when the two armies were in sight of each other, through the will\nof God, the king of Poland retreated with his forces, among which were\ntwenty thousand Tartars at least, without counting his Polanders and\nothers his Christian allies, who were very numerous, and returned to\nhis own country.\n\nAfterward, the king of Lithuania, by the exhortations of the king of\nPoland, invaded Prussia with an immense army, and destroyed the greater\npart which lay on the sea-shores. The Prussians made a thousand of them\nprisoners, and slew many.\n\nThe king of Poland was formerly an infidel, and son to the king of\nLithuania, but, having a great ambition to reign, murdered his father,\nand was for this crime banished the country. He took refuge with the\nthen king of Poland, who received him kindly, and admitted him into his\nfriendship and confidence. He also gained the affections of the princes\nand nobles, insomuch that, on the death of their king, they unanimously\nelected this parricide to succeed him, had him baptised, and married\nhim to the widow of the late king; and, since that time, he has happily\nenough governed that kingdom[53].\n\nAt this period, Sigismond king of Hungary, brother to the king of\nBohemia, took to wife the sister of the above queen of Poland: they\nwere daughters to a german count, called the count de Cilly, of the\nroyal branch of Hungary[54]. The king of Poland laid claim to Hungary\nin right of his wife, and thence took occasion to harrass that country\nas well as Prussia. He sent secret messengers to the king of Lithuania,\nhis cousin german and ally, to press him to invade Prussia on the\nquarter nearest the sea, when he would march his Polanders to form a\njunction and destroy the whole of it. His intentions were discovered\nby the messenger being arrested by orders of the king of Hungary, and\ninformation sent of them to Prussia, whenceforward the king of Hungary\nand grand master took such wise precautions that his future attempts\nwere fruitless.\n\n\n\n\n[A. D. 1410.]\n\nCHAP. XVII.\n\n    THE DUKE OF BERRY, BY THE KING\u2019S COMMANDS, RETURNS TO\n    PARIS.--THE MARRIAGE OF THE SON OF THE KING OF SICILY.--THE\n    ASSEMBLY THAT IS HOLDEN AT MEUN LE CHASTEL.\n\n\nThis year, the duke of Berry was, by the king\u2019s orders, remanded to\nParis, and, on his arrival, was sent, with the king of Navarre, to\nGiens sur Loire, to put an end to the quarrels between the duke of\nBrittany and the count and countess of Penthievre. Although both\nparties had promised to meet them, they did not personally attend, but\nsent commissioners.\n\nThe king of Navarre and the duke of Berry took great pains, and\nproposed various means, to bring about a reconciliation. Finding all\ntheir attempts fruitless, they referred the whole matter, with the\nconsent of the commissioners, to the king\u2019s decision on All-saints-day\nnext coming, and then they returned to Paris.\n\nIn this year was concluded the marriage between the eldest son of Louis\nking of Sicily, and Catherine, daughter to the duke of Burgundy. The\nlady was conducted by sir John de Ch\u00e2lons, lord de Darlay, the lord de\nSt George, sir William de Champdivers, and sir James de Courtjambe, to\nAngers, and there delivered to the queen of Sicily, who received her\nmost affectionately and honourably,--and she magnificently entertained\nthe knights who had brought her. After a short stay at Angers, they\nreturned to their lord, the duke of Burgundy, at Paris.\n\nAt this time, the dukes of Orleans and Bourbon, the counts de Clermont,\nd\u2019Alen\u00e7on, d\u2019Armagnac, the lord Charles d\u2019Albreth, constable, and many\nother lords of great power and authority, held a meeting in the town\nof Meun le Ch\u00e2tel,--where they had several long consultations with\neach other on the state of public affairs, and particularly as to the\nmurder of the late duke of Orleans, principally to consider how they\nshould proceed to take vengeance on the person who had committed it.\nMany different opinions were urged: one was, that the duke of Orleans\nshould declare a deadly war against him, and carry it on by every\npossible means, with the assistance of his relations, friends, and the\nwellwishers to his cause.\n\nOthers said, it would be better to follow another course, and\nremonstrate strongly to the king, their sovereign lord, on the\nnecessity he was under to do strict justice on the duke of Burgundy,\nto which he was the more particularly bound, as the murder was\ncommitted on his own brother. But, as they could not all agree in the\nsame opinion, they broke up the meeting, and appointed another day to\nassemble again.\n\nBefore they separated, a treaty of marriage was entered upon between\nCharles duke of Orleans and the daughter of the count d\u2019Armagnac. She\nwas niece to the duke of Berry by her mother\u2019s side, and sister[55]\nto the count de Savoye. This done, the lords departed for their own\ndomains.\n\nThe duke of Burgundy resided in Paris, and ruled there more\ndespotically than any other of the princes: affairs were solely carried\non by him and his partisans, which, no doubt, made very many jealous of\nhim.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XVIII.\n\n    THE KING OF SICILY GOES TO PROVENCE AND TO BOLOGNA, TO MEET HIS\n    RIVAL KING LADISLAUS.--THE DEATH OF POPE ALEXANDER, AND THE\n    ELECTION OF POPE JOHN.\n\n\nAbout this period, Louis king of Sicily set out from Paris with a\nnumerous body of men at arms, and went for Provence, and thence to\nBologna, to meet king Ladislaus, his opponent, and to defend his\nkingdom of Naples, where his rival was committing great devastation.\nKing Louis had for this raised so considerable a force, that he might\nbe enabled to offer him combat; and he had also the hope that pope\nAlexander would assist him, to the utmost of his ability, in money and\nin men.\n\nAn end was soon put to his expectations in this respect; for, on the\nmorrow of the feast of the discovery of the holy cross, pope Alexander\nwas poisoned in the town of Bologna, as was currently reported, and\ndied most pitifully. His bowels were interred, and his obsequies were\nperformed in the church of the Cordeliers. Mass was celebrated by the\ncardinal de Vimers: the deacon and under deacon were the cardinals\nd\u2019Espaigne and de Thurey. The whole court was dressed in deep mourning.\n\nThe 6th of May, the corpse of the pope, having been embalmed with fine\nspices, was placed in the hall of audience, dressed in his papal robes,\nhis face uncovered, gloves on his hands, but his feet naked, so that\nwhoever pleased might kiss them,--and nine funeral services were there\nperformed.\n\nThere were present twenty cardinals, two patriarchs, four archbishops,\ntwenty-four bishops, with many prelates, abbots, and other churchmen.\nHis escutcheon of arms were placed at the four corners of his coffin;\nand for nine days, masses were celebrated in the same manner as on the\nmorrow of his death. The masses were said by the cardinals in rotation;\nand the ninth day, the body was carried to the Cordeliers for interment.\n\nThe two first bearers were the cardinals de Vimers and de Challant,\nand the two last the cardinals d\u2019Espaigne and de Thurey. The cardinal\nMilles preceded the body bearing a cross. The chorists were the\ncardinals de Bar, (not the son of the duke of Bar, but the cardinal of\nBar[56] in Calabria), and d\u2019Orsini. The cardinal de Vimers performed\nthe service, as he had done at the interment of the bowels.\n\nWhen this ceremony was over, the cardinals returned home dressed in\nblack; and after dinner, they assembled at the palace, and entered\ninto conclave, where they remained shut up from the Wednesday to the\nSaturday following. Some of the cardinals, having consulted together,\nproposed Balthazar, cardinal of Bologna, as sovereign pontiff of\nthe universal church; and the others, who were not of this opinion,\nseeing their numbers were very small, consented to it; and the new\npope was conducted by them to the church of St Peter, where they placed\nthe tiara on his head, and took the oaths of fidelity to him. They\nthen led him to the palace of his predecessor, where every piece of\nfurniture had been carried off, and there did not remain even a door or\nwindow-frame.\n\nOn the morrow, he took the name of pope John XXIII. and great were the\nrejoicings and feasts that ensued. In the procession were twenty-three\ncardinals, two patriarchs, three archbishops, twenty-seven abbots,\nmitred and non-mitred, without reckoning other churchmen, who were\nalmost numberless. The pope wore on that day a silver-gilt tiara bound\nwith white. The following Saturday, the 23d of May, the pope received,\nin the chapel of his predecessors, the holy order of priesthood, when\nthe cardinal de Vimers said the mass, and the cardinal de Challant was\ndeacon: at this service, all the before-named prelates attended.\n\nOn the following day, Sunday, the pope celebrated mass in the church\nof St Peter, having the cardinal de Vimers near him to show him the\nservice. The marquis of Ferrara and the lord of Malatesta were present,\nand held the bason wherein the pope washed his hands. The marquis of\nFerrara had brought with him fifty-four knights, all clothed in scarlet\nand blue, having five trumpets and four companies of minstrels, each\nplaying on a different instrument.\n\nWhen mass was finished, pope John was carried out of the church to a\nvery handsome platform erected without the porch, and there solemnly\ncrowned in the presence of all those whom I have mentioned, and a great\nmultitude of doctors and clergy.\n\nWhen seated on his throne, which was covered all over with cloth of\ngold, he was surrounded by the cardinals de Vimers, de Challant, de\nMilles, d\u2019Espaigne, de Thurey, and de Bar, having tufts of tow in their\nhands. The cardinals lighted their tufts; and as the flame was suddenly\nextinguished, they addressed the pope, saying, \u2018Thus, holy father,\npasses the glory of this world!\u2019 This was done three times.\n\nThe cardinal de Vimers having said some prayers over him and on the\ncrown, placed it upon his head. This crown was a triple one: the first\nof gold, which encircled the forehead within the mitre; the second\nof gold and silver, about the middle of the mitre; and the third, of\nvery fine gold, surmounted it. He was then led down from the platform,\nand placed on a horse covered over with scarlet furniture. The horses\nof the cardinals and bishops, &c. were caparisoned in white; and in\nthis state he was conducted from street to street, making every where\nthe sign of the cross, until he came to where the Jews resided, who\npresented him with a manuscript of the Old Testament. He took it with\nhis own hand, and, having examined it a little, threw it behind him,\nsaying, \u2018Your religion is good, but this of ours is better.\u2019\n\nAs he departed, the Jews followed him, intending to touch him,--in the\nattempt of which, the caparison of his horse was all torn.--Wherever\nhe passed, the pope distributed money,--that is to say, quadrini and\nmailles of Florence, with other coins. There were before and behind him\ntwo hundred men at arms, each having in his hand a leathern mallet,\nwith which they struck the Jews in such wise as it was a pleasure to\nsee.\n\nOn the morrow, he returned to his palace, accompanied by the cardinals\ndressed in crimson,--the patriarchs in like manner,--the archbishops\nand bishops in similar dresses, having white mitres on their heads,\nand numbers of mitred and non-mitred abbots. In this procession were,\nthe marquis of Ferrara[57], the lord Malatesta[58], the lord of\nGaucourt[59], and others, to the amount of forty-four, as well dukes as\ncounts and knights of Italy, all dressed out in their liveries. In each\nstreet, two and two by turns led the pope\u2019s horse by the bridle,--the\none on the right hand, and another on the left.\n\nThere were thirty-six bagpipes and trumpets, and ten bands of minstrels\nplaying on musical instruments, each band consisting of three\nperformers. There were also singers, especially those of the chapel of\nhis predecessor, as well as those belonging to the cardinals and from\ndifferent parts of Italy, who rode before the pope loudly chaunting\nvarious airs, sacred and profane.\n\nWhen he arrived at the palace, he gave his peace to all the cardinals,\nwho, according to their rank in the college, kissed his foot, hand, or\nmouth. The cardinal de Vimers first performed the ceremony, and was\nfollowed by the other cardinals, patriarchs, archbishops, bishops,\nabbots and clergy. He then gave his benediction to the four elements,\nand to all persons in a state of grace, as well to those absent as\npresent, and bestowed his dispensations for four months to come,\nprovided that, during this time, three Pater-nosters should be said by\neach in praying for his predecessor, pope Alexander.\n\nPope John then went to dinner, as it was now about twelve o\u2019clock, and\nthis ceremony had commenced between five and six in the morning.\n\nIn honour of him, feasts were continued at Bologna for the space\nof eight days; and on each of them very handsome processions were\nmade round St Peter\u2019s church, when the prelates were all dressed\nin vermilion robes, with copes of the same. In like manner did the\nCarthusians of St Michael\u2019s Mount, without the walls of Bologna.\n\nThe next day, the 25th of May, pope John held a consistory, in the\npresence of the cardinals, patriarchs, archbishops, bishops, and\npresented to the marquis of Ferrara and the italian heralds, many and\nvarious rich gifts. This was followed by a great feast, with dancing\nand music. The ensuing day, the pope revoked all that his predecessor\nhad done, excepting what he had confirmed, or what had been taken\ncorporal or spiritual possession of.\n\nKing Louis of Sicily arrived at Bologna the Friday after the coronation\nof the pope, and twenty-two cardinals, two patriarchs, six archbishops,\ntwenty bishops and eighteen abbots, handsomely equipped, went out of\nthe city to meet him: on his entrance, he went directly to the pope. He\nwas clothed in scarlet, and his horse\u2019s furniture was ornamented with\nsmall gilt bells: he was attended by about fifty knights dressed in his\nuniform. It was the last day of May that the king arrived,--and he was\nmost graciously received by the pope.\n\nThe ensuing day, the Florentines came to pay their duty and reverence\nto the holy father. They were about three hundred horse, among whom\nwere eighteen knights dressed in scarlet, with feathers bespangled\nwith gold. They were attended by six trumpets, two heralds, and ten\nmusicians playing on different instruments. When they had made their\nreverence to the pope, they returned to their h\u00f4tels, and the next\nday went to court. By reason of their alliance with king Louis, they\nsupplicated the pope to give him assistance against his adversary king\nLadislaus, adding, that they intended affording him every aid in their\npower of men and money. These Florentines were very indignant at the\nlate conduct of the Genoese in regard to the king of Sicily; for when\nthe king of Sicily was sailing with five gallies from Marseilles,\nnear to the port of Genoa, the Genoese, being in the interest of king\nLadislaus, hastily armed fifteen gallies with cross-bows and men at\narms, and sent them to attack the remainder of king Louis\u2019s fleet that\nwas following him, which they conquered, all but one, that escaped\nback to Marseilles by superior sailing, and carried the crews and all\ntheir baggage prisoners to Genoa.\n\nThe pope, having heard their request, asked some time to consider of\nit before he gave an answer. He could not well consent to it, because\nthe Genoese had been long connected with him, and he had also entered\ninto some engagements with king Ladislaus. The matter was, therefore,\ndeferred. King Louis was, notwithstanding this, magnificently feasted\nby the pope and cardinals; after which, he left his court well pleased,\nand returned to Provence.\n\nOn the first day of June, the pope held an open court, and signed many\ngraces and benefices, and all such things as with honour and justice he\ncould sign. He continued from that time to hold public audiences, and\nto do whatever business appertained to the papacy.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XIX.\n\n    THE GRAND MASTER OF PRUSSIA MARCHES A POWERFUL ARMY OF\n    CHRISTIANS INTO LITHUANIA.\n\n\nThis year, 1410, the grand master of the Teutonic order, accompanied\nby his brother knights and a numerous army of three hundred thousand\nChristians, invaded the kingdom of Lithuania, to destroy the whole of\nit. The king of Lithuania was soon ready to meet him; and, aided by\nthe king of Sarmatia, he assembled an army of four hundred thousand\ninfidels, and offered battle.\n\nThe Christians gained a complete victory,--for there remained dead on\nthe field full thirty-six thousand infidels, the principals of whom\nwere the grand general of Lithuania and the constable of Sarmatia. The\nremnant, with the other officers, escaped by flight. Of the Christians,\nonly two hundred were slain, but a great many were wounded.\n\nShortly after, the king of Poland, who was a determined enemy to\nthe grand master of Prussia, (and who had but faintly accepted of\nChristianity in order to obtain his kingdom) marched his Polanders to\nthe assistance of the infidels, whom he strongly pressed to renew the\nwar against Prussia, insomuch that, eight days after this defeat, the\nking of Poland, in conjunction with the aforesaid two kings, assembled\nan army of six hundred thousand men, and marched against the grand\nmaster of Prussia, and other Christian lords. A battle ensued, which\nwas lost by the Christians, who had more than sixty thousand killed\nand wounded. In the number of dead were the grand master of Prussia,\nwith a noble knight from Normandy, called sir John de Ferriere, son to\nthe lord de Ferriere, and another from Picardy, son to the lord du Bos\nd\u2019Ancquin.\n\nIt was currently reported that the day had been lost through the fault\nof the constable of Hungary, who commanded the second squadron of the\nChristians, by running away with all his Hungarians. The infidels,\nhowever, did not gain the glory without loss,--for without counting\nthe Polanders, who had ten thousand men slain, they lost upward of\nsix-score thousand men, according to the reports of the heralds, and\nthe bastard of Scotland, called the count de Hembe[60].\n\nThe lord de Kyeuraing and John de Grez, Hainaulters, were there, and\nwith them full twenty-four gentlemen, their countrymen, who were unhurt\nat this battle, and returned home as speedily as they could.\n\nAfter the engagement, the infidels entered Prussia, and despoiled\nmany parts of it, and took twelve inclosed towns in a short time and\ndestroyed them. They would have persevered in their wickedness, and\nhave done further mischief, had not a valiant knight of the Teutonic\norder, named Charles de Mouroufle[61], rallied a great number of the\nChristians who had fled, and by his prudence and vigour regained the\ngreater part of these towns, and finally driven the infidels out of the\ncountry[62].\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XX.\n\n    THE DUKE OF BERRY QUITS PARIS, AND RETIRES TO HIS OWN\n    ESTATES.--HE GOES AFTERWARD TO ANGERS, AND UNITES WITH THE DUKE\n    OF ORLEANS AND THE OTHER PRINCES OF HIS PARTY.\n\n\nThe duke of Berry, finding that he had not that government of the\nking and the duke of Acquitaine to which he had been accustomed,\nbecame very discontented, and retired to his estates, indignant at\nthe ministers, and particularly at his nephew and godson, the duke\nof Burgundy. Shortly after, he went to Angers, where the dukes of\nOrleans and of Bourbon, and all the principal lords of that party, were\nassembled.\n\nThey went in a body to the cathedral church, and there made oath, in\nthe most solemn manner, to support each other, and mutually to defend\ntheir honour against all who should attempt any thing against it,\nexcepting the king, and ever to remain in strict friendship united,\nwithout acting to the contrary in any kind of measure.\n\nMany great lords in France were not pleased with this confederation;\nand when, shortly after, news of it was brought to the king and his\ncouncil, he was much astonished and dissatisfied therewith.\n\nThe king, in consequence of the advice of the duke of Burgundy and his\nfriends, marched out of Paris, accompanied by him, the duke of Brabant,\nthe count de Montagu, and a large body of chivalry, and went to Senlis:\nthence to the town of Creil, to regain the castle of that place, which\nthe duke of Bourbon held, and had given the government of it to some of\nhis people.\n\nThe governor made so many delays before he surrendered it that the\nking became much displeased; and because they had not obeyed his\nfirst summons, the garrison were made prisoners, and carried bound\nto the prisons of the Ch\u00e2telet in Paris. The countess of Clermont,\ncousin-german to the king, soon after made application for their\ndeliverance, and obtained it; and on the morrow the king appointed\nanother garrison, and returned to Paris.\n\nThis expedition was not very agreeable to the Orleans-faction,--and\nthey continued to collect daily, and inlist in their party as many as\nthey could.\n\nThe duke of Burgundy became very uneasy at their proceedings; for he\nsuspected the duke of Orleans and his party would infringe the peace\nwhich had so lately been patched up between them at Chartres, or that\nthey would march a large force to Paris, to seize the government,\ntogether with the persons of the king and duke of Acquitaine.\n\nTo obviate this, he caused several royal summons to be proclaimed in\nvarious parts of the realm, for the assembling of men at arms and\nquartering them in the villages round Paris, to be ready to defend the\nking and his government against the ill-intentioned. By the advice of\nhis brothers and the king of Navarre, he resolved to defend himself\nby force against his adversaries, and caused it to be proclaimed\nthroughout the kingdom, in the king\u2019s name, that no one should dare to\nassemble armed in company of the dukes of Berry and Orleans, and their\nallies, under pain of corporal punishment and confiscation of goods.\n\nThe Orleans-faction, however, continued their meetings in spite of\nthis proclamation, and even forced their vassals to serve under and\naccompany them: I mean, such of them as were dilatory in obeying their\nsummons. There were, therefore, at this time, great and frequent\nassemblies of armed men in different parts of France, to the prejudice\nof the poor people.\n\nThose lords that were well inclined to the king came to Paris, and\ntheir men were quartered in the flat country of the island of France.\nThe Orleans-party fixed their quarters at Chartres and the adjacent\nparts; and their forces might amount, according to the estimate of\nwell-informed persons, to full six thousand men in armour, four\nthousand cross-bows, and sixteen hundred archers, without counting the\nunarmed infantry, of which there were great numbers.\n\nIn regard to the army which the duke of Burgundy had assembled by\norders from the king, it was estimated to consist of upward of sixteen\nthousand combatants, all men of tried courage. During this time, the\nking of Navarre and his brother, the count de Mortain, at the request\nof the duke of Burgundy, negotiated a peace between the duke of\nBrittany, their nephew, and the count de Penthievre, son-in-law to the\nduke of Burgundy.\n\nThis was done in the hope that the duke of Brittany would be induced\nto assist the king with his Bretons, and give up the Orleans-party, to\nwhom he had engaged himself. On the conclusion of this peace between\nthe two parties, twenty thousand golden crowns were sent the duke, to\ndefray the expenses he had been at in raising men at arms.\n\nLarge sums of money were also sent to the lord d\u2019Albreth, constable\nof France, that he might collect a numerous body of men at arms, and\nmarch them to Paris, to serve the king. He had not any great desire to\nperform this, for he was wholly inclined to the duke of Orleans and his\nallies, as was perfectly notorious shortly afterward.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XXI.\n\n    THE DEATH OF THE DUKE OF BOURBON.--THE PROCLAMATION OF THE KING\n    OF FRANCE.--THE DUKE OF ORLEANS AND HIS ALLIES SEND LETTERS TO\n    THE PRINCIPAL TOWNS IN FRANCE.\n\n\nDuring this troublesome time, Louis duke of Bourbon, uncle to the\nking of France by the mother\u2019s side, being full sixty years of age,\nfeeling himself oppressed with years and sickness, caused himself to be\nconveyed to his residence at Moulins[63] in the Bourbonnois, where he\ndeparted this life, and was buried in the church of the canons, which\nhe had founded.\n\nHe was succeeded by his only son, the count de Clermont, who, after\nsome days of lamentation, had the funeral obsequies of his father\nperformed, and, having arranged his affairs, returned to the duke of\nOrleans and the other lords at Chartres, and firmly united himself with\nthem, treading in the steps of his late father. The duke of Bourbon\nhad long held the office of great chamberlain of France, from the\nfriendship of the king, and was in possession of it even at the time of\nhis death; but at the entreaty of the king of Navarre and the duke of\nBurgundy, the king now gave it to the count de Nevers, to exercise the\nduties of it in the usual manner.\n\nAt this time, the duchess of Brittany, daughter to the king of France,\nwas brought to bed of a son; and she sent to request the duke of\nAcquitaine, her brother, to stand godfather. He sent, as his proxy,\nsir David de Brimeu, knight, lord of Humbercourt, with a handsome\npresent of jewels, which sir David gave her on the part of the duke of\nAcquitaine.\n\nThe king again issued his summons to the different bailiwicks and\nseneschalships in the realm, for all persons to arm without delay who\nwere bounden so to do from the tenure of their fiefs or arriere fiefs,\nand to march instantly to Paris to serve the king against the dukes of\nOrleans, Berry, Bourbon, the counts d\u2019Armagnac, d\u2019Alen\u00e7on, and others\ntheir allies, who, notwithstanding the king\u2019s positive orders to the\ncontrary, continued daily to assemble large bodies of men at arms, to\nthe destruction of his country and subjects.\n\nThe above dukes wrote letters to the king, to the university of Paris,\nand to many of the principal towns, to explain the causes why they had\nthus confederated and collected men at arms; one of which, signed with\ntheir signs-manuel, they sent to the town of Amiens, and the contents\nwere as follows:\n\n\u2018To our well-beloved and very dear citizens, burgesses, and inhabitants\nof the town of Amiens, health and affection. We have written to\nour most redoubted and sovereign lord the king of France in manner\nfollowing:--We dukes of Berry, of Orleans, and of Bourbon, counts of\nAlen\u00e7on and of Armagnac, your humble uncles, relations and subjects,\nfor ourselves and all others our adherents, wellwishers to your\nperson,--as the rights of your domination, your crown and royal\nmajesty, have been so nobly instituted, and founded on justice,\npower, and the true obedience of your subjects,--and as your glory\nand authority are resplendent through all parts of the world, you\nhaving been worthily consecrated and anointed by the holy roman see,\nand considered by all Christendom as sovereign monarch and equal\ndistributor of justice, as well to the poor as to the rich, without\nowing obedience to any other lord, but God and his Divine Majesty, who\nhas been pleased most worthily to have gifted you,--may all those who\nare connected with you by blood, by their frank and loyal affections,\nguard and defend your sacred person as your relations and subjects.\n\n\u2018And may we, in particular, as your near relations, and for that cause\nmore obliged to it, set an example of due obedience to your other\nsubjects, and exert ourselves in preserving to you free liberty of\naction in every part of your government, insomuch that you may have\npower to reward the good and punish the wicked, and to preserve every\none in his just rights, and likewise that you may execute justice in\nsuch wise that your kingdom may remain in peace, first to the honour\nof God, and then to your own honour, and to the example of your good\nfriends and subjects, by following the paths of your predecessors,\nthe kings of France, who, by this noble way of governing their great\nkingdom, have ever preserved tranquillity and peace, insomuch that all\nChristian nations, far and near, and even infidels, have had recourse\nto them in their disputes, and have been perfectly contented with their\ndecisions on the cases referred to them, as the fountains of justice\nand loyalty.\n\n\u2018And, most sovereign lord, that your power, justice, and the state of\nyour government may not suffer at present any wound or diminution,\nand that public affairs may be managed according to the principles\nof reason, in such wise as may be apparent to all men of sound\nunderstanding;--\n\n\u2018For this effect, most redoubted sovereign, we, the above-written, have\nconfederated and assembled, that we may most humbly lay before you the\nreal state of your situation, in regard to your royal person, and also\nthat of my lord of Acquitaine, your eldest son. We have likewise to lay\nbefore you the manner in which you are enthralled, and the government\ncarried on, that justice may be restored, and the public weal no longer\nsuffer, as we can more fully explain. Should any persons deny this,\nlet your majesty, by the advice of your council, appoint some of the\nprinces of your blood, and other impartial and unprejudiced persons,\nto inquire into it, in whatever number you in your wisdom may select.\nBut we advise that you speedily and effectually provide for the safety\nof your own person, and for that of my lord of Acquitaine, your eldest\nson, so that your state may enjoy justice and a good government, to the\nadvancement of the public welfare, and that the power and authority\nmay be exercised by you alone, freely and uncontrolled by any other\nperson whatever; and that such a desirable object may be obtained, we,\nthe above-named, offer our earnest prayers, and, at the same time, our\nlives and fortunes, whatever they may be, which God has graciously\ngranted us in this world, for the just defence of your rights, and in\nopposing all who may attempt to infringe on them, if any such there be.\n\n\u2018Most redoubted lord, we also inform you, that we shall not break up\nour confederation until you shall have listened to us, and until we\nshall see that you have properly provided against the inconveniences\nwe have mentioned, and until you be fully and wholly reinstated in\nthat power which is your right. To this, most redoubted lord, are we\nbound, as well in regard to what we have already said, as from fear,\nhonour and reverence to our Creator, from whom originates your royal\nauthority, and also to satisfy justice, and then yourself, who are\nsovereign king on earth, and our sole lord. To your support we are\nurged by our kindred and by our love to your person; for in truth,\nmost redoubted sovereign, there is nothing we dread so much as having\noffended God, yourself, and wounded our own honour, by leaving for so\nlong time unnoticed the aforesaid grievances, which are notorious to\nevery one.\n\n\u2018In like manner as we signify the above to you, we shall do the same to\nall prelates, lords, universities, cities and principal towns of your\nrealm, and in general to all your wellwishers.\n\n\u2018Most redoubted lord, we humbly supplicate that you will deign to hear\nus, and consider of what we have written,--for the sole object we aim\nat personally affects yourself and your government; and we earnestly\nbeg that you will speedily adopt the most effectual measures for the\nenjoyment of your own freedom of action, and that your government may\nbe carried on to the praise of God first, and your own glory, and\nto the advantage of all your good subjects who are anxious for your\nwelfare.\n\n\u2018We have written this, that you may know our intentions, and the cause\nof our assembling, which is solely for the preservation of the personal\nliberty of our lord and king, and the affranchisement of his government\nfrom any hands but his own. For this object we have sought the advice\nof the most prudent men, and shall follow their counsels, with all the\nmeans God has put in our power, to obtain so desirable an end, for the\ngeneral welfare of the realm; and we intend so to act toward our lord\nthe king that God and the world shall be satisfied with us.\n\n\u2018And we most earnestly entreat that for so praiseworthy an object\nyou will join us, and exert yourselves in the same cause; for it is\nnot properly us but the king your lord that you will serve, whom by\nyour oaths you are bounden to assist,--and know that for so doing you\nwill be commended by all men of understanding and prudence. Given at\nChartres the 2d day of December, 1410.\u2019\n\nThis letter, when received by the council of the town of Amiens,\nproduced very little sensation,--for all, or the greater part of the\ninhabitants, were inclined to the duke of Burgundy. When a similar one\nwas read in the council of state, it did not make any impression on the\nking, nor did it seem advisable that the dukes should have an audience;\nbut, on the contrary, orders were sent to them to disband their forces\nwithout delay, on pain of incurring the royal indignation.----They\nrefused to obey this order, and bade the messenger tell the king,\nthat they would not cease assembling until he should grant them an\naudience, and hear their complaints. At this period, the dukes of\nAcquitaine and Burgundy paid a visit to the queen of France at her\nresidence in the castle of Melun, and left there a garrison, having\nbrought back with them the queen and her children to the castle of\nVincennes.\n\nThe duke of Brabant at this time left Paris, to go to his country, and\nassemble his Brabanters to serve the king. Many able ambassadors were\nsent, in the king\u2019s name, to the lords assembled at Chartres; and among\nthem was the grand master of Rhodes, to signify to them that they must\ndisband their army, and that, if they pleased to wait on the king in\ntheir private capacity, he would see them.\n\nThis they refused; and as they continued disobedient, the king took\npossession of the counties of Boulogne[64], Estampes, Valois,\nBeaumont, Clermont, and other lands belonging to the said dukes,\ncounts, and their adherents, of whatever rank they might be. The king\u2019s\nofficers appointed governors to the castles and fortresses within these\ncountries, whom they ordered to govern them at the expense of the\naforesaid lords.\n\nSo very numerous were the forces that assembled near Paris, in\nobedience to the summons from the king and the duke of Burgundy, that\nthe oldest persons had not for a long time seen so many men at arms\ntogether.\n\nAmong the number was the duke of Brabant, with a great force. He was\nquartered in the town of St Denis, where he lived at the expense of the\ngreater part of the inhabitants, as if he had been in the open country.\nThe count de Penthievre, son-in-law to the duke of Burgundy, was there\nwith him, accompanied by a large body of Bretons.\n\nTwo thousand men belonging to the count Waleran de St Pol were\nquartered at Menil-Aubry, and the adjacent villages.--Because the\ncount himself resided in Paris, he one day ordered his troops to be\nassembled under the lord de Chin, for him to march them to Paris to be\nmustered and enrolled for pay; but it happened, as they were marching\nthrough St Denis to obey the order, that a dispute arose between them\nand the Brabanters, on account of some enterprise which the last had\nmade against the lord de Carlian, a native of the Boulonois, so that\nthe two parties armed and drew up in battle-array to decide matters\nby combat. The duke of Brabant was soon informed of this tumult, and\nhastened from Paris to check his own men, and acted so prudently with\nboth parties that an end was put to it; but he was very wroth with the\nfirst promoters of it, for he was married to the daughter and heiress\nof the count de St Pol.\n\nWhen they had marched through Saint Denis, they came before their lord,\nthe count de St Pol, in Paris, who having reviewed them, and paid many\ncompliments to their captains, dismissed them to the quarters whence\nthey had come. In order to pay these troops which had been levied,\nas has been said, by orders from the king and the duke of Burgundy,\nand which amounted, by the muster-rolls, to fifteen thousand men with\nhelmets, seventeen thousand cross-bows and archers, very heavy taxes\nwere levied throughout the realm, and particularly on the city of\nParis. It will be impossible to relate one half of the mischiefs the\narmies of both parties committed: suffice it to say, that churches,\nchurchmen, and the poor people were very great sufferers.\n\nThe Orleans-party, shortly after this, marched from Chartres\nto Montlehery, seven leagues from Paris, and there, and in the\nneighbouring villages, quartered their army, ruining the whole country\non their line of march. The lords and adherents of this faction, as\nwell clergy as seculars, wore, as their badge, a narrow band of white\nlinen on their shoulders, hanging over their left arm, like to a deacon\nwhen celebrating divine service.\n\nWhen the king of France and his council learnt that they had approached\nso near the capital, they hastily dispatched to the leaders the count\nde la Marche, the archbishop of Rheims, the bishop of Beauvais, and the\ngrand master of Rhodes, with some others, to persuade them to disband\ntheir army, and come before him at Paris, in consequence of his former\norders, without arms, in the manner in which vassals should wait on\ntheir lords, and that he would do them justice in regard to their\ndemands; but that, should they refuse, he would instantly march his\nforces against them.--The princes made answer, that they would not\nact otherwise than they had said in their letter to the king; and the\nambassadors, seeing they could not gain any thing, returned to Paris.\n\nIn like manner, the university sent to them an embassy of learned\nmen, headed by Noe\u00e9tz, abbot of Povegny and doctor in divinity, who\nharangued them very ably and gravely. They were very handsomely\nreceived by the princes, especially by the duke of Berry, who, among\nother grievances, complained much that his nephew, the king, should be\ncounselled by such fellows as the provost of Paris, and others of the\nsame sort, who now ruled the realm, which was most miserably governed,\nas he was ready to explain, article by article, when they should be\nadmitted to an audience.\n\nThey could obtain no other reply than that, with God\u2019s pleasure, they\nwould accomplish, to the utmost of their power, the matters contained\nin their circular letters to the university and principal towns.\n\nOn this repeated ill success, the king, by the advice of his council,\nsent another embassy, composed of the queen, the cardinal de Bar, the\ncount de St Pol, and others. The count de St Pol had lately accepted,\nwith the king\u2019s approbation, the office of grand butler of France,\nwhich the provost of Paris had held, through the interest of the count\nde Tancarville, by a gift from the king.\n\nNotwithstanding the queen and her companions were received with every\nhonour, she did not remain with their army, but went to the castle\nof Marcoussi, which is not far distant from Montlehery, with her\nattendants, and remained there some time negotiating with them, and\nsome of the princes daily visited her. Although she acted with much\nperseverance, she failed in her object,--for the princes were firm in\ntheir resolution of marching with their army to the king, and requiring\nthat he would execute justice and attend to the affairs of government,\nand choose another set of ministers than those now in power.\n\nFinding she was labouring in vain, she returned with her companions\nto Paris, and related to the king all that had passed. He was very\nindignant, and much troubled thereat; and on the morrow, the 23d\nSeptember, he ordered all the men at arms that were come to serve him\nto be drawn out, and the baggage and artillery waggons to be made ready\ninstantly to march against the Orleans-party, to give them battle.\n\nWhen all were ready, and as he was going to attend mass and afterward\nto mount his horse, he was met by the rector of the university,\nmagnificently accompanied by all the members and supporters of it, who\nremonstrated with him, that his daughter, the university of Paris, was\npreparing to leave that city, from the great want of provisions, which\nthe men at arms of the two parties prevented coming to Paris,--for no\none could venture on the high roads without being robbed and insulted;\nand, likewise, that all the low countries round Paris were despoiled by\nthese men at arms. They most humbly requested, that he would provide\na remedy, and give them such answer as might seem to him good. The\nchancellor, namely, master Arnauld de Corbie, instantly replied, \u2018The\nking will assemble his council after dinner, and you shall have an\nanswer.\u2019 The king of Navarre, being present, entreated the king that he\nwould fix an hour for hearing them again after dinner; and the king,\ncomplying with his request, appointed an hour for the rector to return.\n\nWhen the king had dined, he entered the _chambre verde_, attended by\nthe following princes: the dukes of Acquitaine, Burgundy and Brabant,\nthe marquis du Pont, the duke of Lorraine, the counts de Mortain,\nde Nevers and de Vaudemont, with many other great lords, as well\necclesiastical as secular. The king of Navarre made four requests to\nthe king: first, that all the princes of the blood, as well on the one\nside as on the other, should retire to their principalities, and never\nmore interfere in the king\u2019s government, and likewise that henceforth\nthey should not receive any profits or pensions, as well from the\nsubsidies arising from their lands as from other exactions, but live\non their own proper revenues until the public treasury should be in\na better state than it was at that moment: however, should the king\nbe inclined to make them presents of any thing, or call them near his\nperson, they should be alway ready to obey him.\n\nHis second request was, that some diminution should take place in those\ntaxes that most aggrieved the people.\n\nThe third, that as some of the citizens of Paris had lent different\nsums of money to the king, of which repayment had been promised, but\nnot made, sufficient assignments on the treasury should be given to\nthem.\n\nThe fourth, that the affairs of the king and realm should be governed\nby prudent men, taken from the three estates of the kingdom. When the\nking of Navarre had ended, the king himself replied, and said he would\ntake advice on what he had proposed, and then give him such answers as\nought to satisfy him and every one else.\n\nWhen this was over, the king showed the same determination as before\nto march, on the morrow morning, against the rebellious lords; but he\nwas overruled, and the queen, with the former ambassadors, were again\nsent to negotiate a peace. On their arrival at the army of the princes,\nshe exerted herself, as it was said very much and loyally; for it was\ncommonly reported that she was in her heart inclined to the Orleans\nfaction.\n\nDuring the time of this embassy, the count Am\u00e9 de Savoye, who had been\nsent for by the king, arrived at Paris with five hundred men at arms.\nHis brothers-in-law the dukes of Burgundy and Brabant, and the count\nde Nevers, attended by many other lords, went out to meet him beyond\nthe gate of St Anthony, and thence conducted him to the palace to the\nking, who very kindly received him.\n\nSome days after, the queen, not having more success than before,\nreturned to the king, and told him that she could not any way bring\nthem to terms, for they were obstinate in their original intentions.\nShe then hastened to the castle of Vincennes as speedily as she could.\n\nOn the ensuing morning, the aforesaid lords quitted Montlehery; and\nthe duke of Berry came to his h\u00f4tel of Vinchestre[65], which he had\nrebuilt, and was there lodged. The duke of Orleans fixed his quarters\nat Gentilly, in the palace of the bishop, and the count d\u2019Armagnac at\nVitry; the rest as near to each other as they could; and at vespers,\nthey had advanced as far as the suburbs of St Marcel and the gate de\nBordelles.\n\nThe king, the duke of Burgundy, and the other princes, were greatly\nsurprised at this boldness; and the Parisians, at their own expense,\ncollected a body of a thousand men armed with helmets to serve as a\nguard during the night, and they also made great fires in very many of\nthe streets. To prevent them from crossing the Seine at Charenton, they\nsent two hundred men at arms to defend that pass.\n\nThe third day, Arthur count de Richemont, brother to the duke of\nBrittany, joined the dukes of Berry and Orleans, with six thousand\nbreton horse, to the great displeasure of the king, and especially of\nthe duke of Burgundy; for the duke of Brittany had lately been summoned\nby the king to attend him with his Bretons, and had, for this purpose,\nreceived a very large sum of money. The duke, in consequence, having\nother business in hand, sent his brother to serve the king in his room.\n\nIt was also said, that the lord d\u2019Albreth, constable of France, had\ndisposed of the money sent him in the same manner, and had employed it\nin the service of the duke of Berry. The army of the princes marched to\nSaint Cloud, and to the adjoining towns, which they plundered, taking\nby force whatever they were in need of. Some of the worst of them\nravished and robbed many women, who fled to Paris, and made clamorous\noutcries against their ravishers, requiring vengeance from the king,\nand restitution, were it possible, of what they had been plundered of.\n\nThe king, moved with pity, and by the importunity of his ministers,\nordered a decree to be drawn out, which condemned the whole of the\nOrleans-party to death and confiscation of goods. While this was doing,\nthe duke of Berry, uncle to the king, hastily sent ambassadors to\nParis to prevent it from taking effect, and in the name of their lord\nrequested that the decree might be a little delayed, when other means\nof accommodation, through God\u2019s grace, would be found.\n\nThis request was granted, and the proclamation of the decree put off:\na negotiation was entered into warmly by both parties, although the\nking was very much displeased that the princes of his blood were thus\nquarrelling with each other, so that he should be forced to proceed\nwith rigour against them. To prevent the effusion of blood, the king\ndesired his chancellor and others of his privy council to exert\nthemselves diligently that peace might be established; and he likewise\nspoke to the same purpose to the duke of Burgundy, the count de St\nPol, and other princes, who promised faithfully that an accommodation\nshould take place.\n\nWhile these matters were going on, the lord de Dampierre, the bishop\nof Noyon, the lord de Tignonville, master Gautier de Col, and others,\nambassadors from the king of France, were sent from Paris to Boulogne,\nto meet an embassy from the king of England, consisting of the lord\nBeaumont, the bishop of St David\u2019s, and others, who had arrived at\nCalais to treat of a truce. It was prolonged from All-saints-day, when\nthe former one expired, to the feast of Easter ensuing.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XXII.\n\n    IN CONSEQUENCE OF THE NEGOTIATIONS BETWEEN THE TWO PARTIES OF\n    BURGUNDY AND OF ORLEANS, PEACE IS MADE BETWEEN THEM, AND CALLED\n    \u2018THE PEACE OF WINCHESTER,\u2019 WHICH WAS THE SECOND PEACE.\n\n\nAfter the ambassadors from both parties, namely those of the king and\nduke of Burgundy on the one hand, and those of the dukes of Berry, of\nOrleans, and of Bourbon, on the other, had held several conferences,\nthe following treaty was at length concluded, on the 2d of November.\n\nThe princes of the blood on each side, with the exception of the count\nde Mortain, were to retire to their principalities, and lead back their\nforces, committing as little damage as possible to the countries they\nshould pass through, without fraud or deception. The duke of Berry had\nliberty, if he pleased, to reside at Giens-sur-Loire, and the count\nd\u2019Armagnac might stay there with him for fifteen days. The king of\nNavarre was to depart for his duchy of Nemours. The duke of Brabant\nmight, if he so pleased, visit his sister, the duchess of Burgundy, in\nthat country.\n\nThe aforesaid princes were to conduct their men at arms so that all\ntrespassing might be mutually avoided on each other\u2019s lands,--nor\nshould they suffer any of their adherents to commit waste or damage, so\nthat all inconvenience or source of quarrel might be avoided.\n\nItem, in whatever garrisons there shall be more men than are usually\nkept, the same shall be reduced to the accustomed number of men\nretained therein for its defence, without any fraud or deception. And\nthat these terms may be faithfully observed, the aforesaid lords shall\npromise, on their oaths, made before such princes as the king may\nnominate, that they will punctually and loyally keep every article.\n\nItem, the captains of their troops shall make oath also to the due\nobservance of this treaty; and if it be the good pleasure of the king\nhe may appoint some of his knights as conductors to the men at arms,\nand superintendents on their leaders, to prevent them and their men\nfrom delaying their march, and also from committing waste in the\ncountries through which they shall pass.\n\nItem, the aforesaid lords will not return near the person of the king,\nunless they be sent for by him, by letters patent under the great seal,\nconfirmed by his council, or on urgent business,--nor shall any of the\naforesaid lords intrigue to obtain orders for their return; and this\nthey shall especially swear to before commissioners nominated for the\npurpose. The king shall make the terms of this treaty public, and all\nthe articles they shall swear to observe.\n\nShould the king think it necessary to send for the duke of Berry,\nhe shall, at the same time, summon the duke of Burgundy, and _vice\nversa_; and this he will observe, in order that they may both meet at\nthe same time on the appointed day, which will hold good until the\nensuing Easter in the year 1411; and from that day until the following\nEaster in 1412, no one of the aforesaid shall proceed against another\nby acts of violence or by words.--Every article of this treaty to be\nproperly drawn out and signed by the king and his council, with certain\npenalties to be incurred on the infringement of any of them.\n\nItem, the king shall select certain able and discreet persons, of\nunblemished characters, and no way pensioners, but such as have solely\ngiven their oaths of allegiance to the king, to form the royal council;\nand when such persons have been chosen, a list of their names shall be\nshown to the princes on each side.\n\nItem, the dukes of Berry and Burgundy, having the wardship of the duke\nof Acquitaine, shall agree together as to the person who shall be their\nsubstitute in that office during their absence; and powers for so doing\nshall be sent to the duke of Berry, as he is at present without them.\n\nItem, the provost of Paris shall be dismissed from all offices which he\nholds under the king, and another shall be appointed according to the\nking\u2019s pleasure, and as he may judge expedient.\n\nItem, it was ordained, that no knight, or his heirs, should in future\nsuffer any molestation because he had not obeyed the summons sent him\nby either of the parties; and should they be any way molested, the king\nwould punish the offender by confiscation of his property. Letters,\nconfirming this last article, shall be given by the king and the\naforesaid lords to whoever may require them.\n\nThis treaty was concluded on All-saints day, and on the ensuing Monday\nconfirmed; and four days after, the greater part of the articles were\nfulfilled. Sir John de Neele, chancellor to the duke of Acquitaine,\nwas, by the king\u2019s command, appointed to receive the oaths of the lords\non each side.\n\nThe king dismissed his provost of Paris, sir Peter des Essars, knight,\nfrom all his offices, and nominated sir Brunelet de Sainct-Cler, one of\nhis masters of the household, to the provostship. He also sent letters,\nsealed with his great seal, to the duke of Berry, appointing him to\nthe guardianship of his son, the duke of Acquitaine.\n\nIn consequence of one of the articles above recited, twelve knights,\nfour bishops, and four lords of the parliament, were appointed to\ngovern the kingdom,--namely, the archbishop of Rheims, the bishops\nof Noyon and Saint Flour, master John de Torcy, lately one of the\nparliament, but now bishop of Tournay, the grand master of the king\u2019s\nhousehold sir Guichart Daulphin, the grand master of Rhodes, the\nlords de Montenay, de Toursy, de Rambures, d\u2019Offemont, de Rouvroy, de\nRumacourt, Saquet de Toursy, le vidame d\u2019Amiens, sir John de Toursy,\nknight to the duke of Berry, and grand master of his household, and the\nlord de St George. The two last were nominated, by the dukes of Berry\nand Burgundy, guardians to the duke of Acquitaine during their absence.\n\nThe two parties now left Paris and the adjoining fortresses and\ncastles; but on the following Saturday, the king was again strongly\nseized with his usual malady, and confined in his h\u00f4tel of St Pol. The\nqueen and her attendants, then at Vincennes, returned to Paris with her\nson, the duke of Acquitaine, and fixed their residence, with her lord,\nin the h\u00f4tel de St Pol.\n\nThe duke of Burgundy went to Meaux, where he was met by the king of\nNavarre;--and thence the duke went to Arras and Flanders, accompanied\nby sir Peter des Essars, late provost of Paris, and his most\nconfidential adviser; and he always gave him the title of provost of\nParis, as though he had still retained the office.\n\nConformably to the treaty, all the men at arms on each side returned\nto the places whence they had come, but plundering the poor people\non their march. A number of Lombards and Gascons had formed part of\nthe army of the duke of Orleans, who were mounted on terrible horses,\nthat were taught to wheel round when on full gallop, which seemed very\nastonishing to the French, Flemings, Picards, and Brabanters, who had\nnot been accustomed to such movements.\n\nBecause the count d\u2019Armagnac had joined the duke of Orleans with a\nlarge body, his men were called _Armagnacs_; and in consequence, the\nwhole of that faction were called _Armagnacs_. Although there were many\nprinces of much higher rank in either party than the count d\u2019Armagnac,\nthey were not pleased if they were not called by this name, which\nlasted a very considerable time.\n\nAs the treaty before mentioned had been concluded at the h\u00f4tel de\nWinchester, where the dukes of Berry and Orleans, with others of their\nparty were amusing themselves, it was called \u2018The Peace of Winchester.\u2019\n\nAll who had come to these meetings at Paris now departed, and those\nto whom the government had been intrusted remained near the person of\nthe king and the duke of Acquitaine. The people expected, that by this\nmeans they should enjoy more peaceable times; but it happened just the\ncontrary, as you shall shortly hear.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XXIII.\n\n    A MEETING OF THE UNIVERSITY AND CLERGY IS HELD ON THE XXIII. OF\n    NOVEMBER, IN THE CHURCH OF ST BERNARD AT PARIS, ON THE STATE OF\n    THE CHURCH.\n\n\nWhen peace had been established, a large congregation was held, by\norder of the university, on the 23d of November, in the church of\nthe Bernardins in Paris,--to which were called, the bishop of Puy\nin Auvergne, many other prelates, and in general all bachelors and\nlicentiates in canon and civil law, although in former times doctors\nonly had been summoned.\n\nThis assembly was holden at the request of the archbishop of Pisa,\nand other legates from the pope, on the subject of tythes, the vacant\nbenefices, and the effects of the dead. But it was opened by the\nadoption of a solemn ordinance, which had been ordained during the\npapacy of Pietro della Luna, respecting the liberties of the french\nchurch, in the year 1406, and since confirmed by the king, his great\ncouncil, and the parliament, namely, that the said church shall be\nmaintained in all its ancient privileges. It was thus freed from all\ntythes, procurations, and subsidies, or taxes whatever. And as the\nobject of these legates was to establish the above impositions, it was\nresolved that the aforesaid ordinance should be strictly conformed to;\nand the more effectually to have it observed, they sent deputations\nto the king, to his council, and to the parliament, to whom the guard\nof this ordinance belonged, to obviate the inconveniences that might\nfollow should any article of it be infringed.\n\nIt was also concluded, that should the legates attempt, by menaces of\necclesiastical censures or otherwise, to compel payment of any tribute,\nan appeal should be made from them to a general council of the church.\n\nItem, should any collectors or sub-collectors exact subsidies to\nthe church, they shall be arrested, and punished by confiscation of\nproperty, and, when they have no property, by imprisonment.\n\nIt was also concluded, that to settle this matter, the king\u2019s attorney,\nand other lords, should be requested to join the university. But it was\nat last resolved, that should the pope plead an evident want of means\nto support the church, a council should be called, and a charitable\nsubsidy granted, the which should be collected by certain discreet\npersons selected by the council, and the amount distributed according\nto the directions of the said council.\n\nOn the ensuing Monday was held a royal sessions, at which the duke of\nAcquitaine, the archbishop of Pisa, and the other legates from the\npope, the rector and the members of the university were present. In\nthis meeting, the archbishop declared, that what he demanded was due\nto the apostolic chamber, by every right, divine, canon, civil and\nnatural, and that it was sacred and simple justice,--adding, that\nwhoever should deny this right was scarcely a Christian.\n\nThe university was greatly displeased, and said, that such expressions\nwere derogatory to the king\u2019s honour, to that of the university, and\nconsequently of the whole kingdom. From what had passed, another\ngeneral assembly was holden on Sunday the 30th of November, in the\nplace where it had been held the preceding Sunday; and it was then\ndetermined that the university should send a deputation to the king,\nto lay before him the words uttered by the legates, and to demand that\nthey should be publicly recanted by them. It was proposed, that in case\nthey should refuse so to do, the faculty of theologians should bring\naccusations against them, on the articles of faith, and they should be\npunished according to the exigence of the case. It was also resolved,\nthat the university of Paris should write letters to all the other\nuniversities in the realm, and to the prelates and clergy, to invite\nthem to unite in their opposition to such tenets.\n\nMany other things were agitated in this meeting, which I pass over for\nthe sake of brevity. It was, however, finally concluded to send an\nanswer to the pope, that he could not have any subsidy granted him in\nthe way which had been proposed. The meeting came to the resolution,\nthat the university of Paris should require from the archbishop of\nRheims, and those of the members of the king\u2019s government who, as\nmembers, had given their oaths to the university, to join in the\nmeasures they had adopted, otherwise they should be expelled the\nuniversity.\n\nIt should be known, that while these things were passing, the legates,\nfearful of the consequences, hastily left Paris, without taking leave,\nas is usually done. The holy father, however, sent ambassadors to the\nking, to demand payment of the tenth imposed on the french church. When\nthey declared the object of their mission to the council of state, and\nin the presence of the duke of Acquitaine, they said, that not only\nwas the french church bound to pay this subsidy to the pope, but all\nother churches which were under his obedience,--first, from the divine\nlaw in Leviticus, which declares that all deacons shall pay to the\nhigh priest a tenth of their possessions,--and, 2dly, by natural and\npositive law.\n\nWhilst these things were passing, the university came to the council,\nand on the morrow a congregation was held in the monastery of the\nBernardins. It was then resolved that the manner of demanding this\nsubsidy should be reprobated, for that it was iniquitous, and contrary\nto the decree of the king and his council in the year 1406, for the\npreservation of the franchises of the french church. The university\ninsisted on this decree being preserved inviolate, and declared, that\nif the pope or his legates attempted to constrain any person to pay\nthis subsidy by censures of the church, it would appeal to a general\ncouncil on this subject. Should any of the new ministers attempt any\nthing against this decree, the university would appeal to the king and\nthe whole council of state; and should any members of the university\nurge the payment of this tenth, they should be expelled; and if any\npersons, guilty of the above offence, should have any property of their\nown, the university would require that the said property should be\nconfiscated to the king\u2019s use, otherwise they should be imprisoned.\n\nShould the holy father adopt the manner of raising this subsidy by\nway of charity, it would be agreeable to the university that the king\nshould call together the prelates of his realm,--first, to consider\nwhat subjects should be discussed in the general council of the church\nto be holden on this occasion; secondly, to deliberate on the demands\nmade by the ambassadors respecting the tenth. Should it be determined\nfor the pope to receive this subsidy, the university expressed its wish\nthat some sufficient person should be deputed from this kingdom to\nreceive the amount of the same, for the peace and union of the greek\nand latin churches, and from England for aid of the holy land, and the\npreaching the gospel to all the world; for such were the purposes for\nwhich the legates declared the holy father raised this subsidy. The\nuniversity solicited the members of the parliament to unite themselves\nwith them, for it was in support of their decree made on the demand of\nthe king\u2019s attorney-general.\n\nJuvenal des Ursins[66] was deputed by the university to reply to what\nthe pope\u2019s ambassadors had advanced before the council; but at length\nthe archbishop of Pisa, perceiving he could not otherwise gain his\nobject, humbled himself much before the university, and spoke privately\nto some of the principal members to prevail on them to assist him.\nHowever, on the 28th day of January, it was declared, that no subsidy\nwhatever should be granted to the pope without the previous consent of\nthe french church; and the deliberation on this matter was deferred to\nthe 10th of February, when many prelates were summoned to give their\nopinions thereon. Through the active diligence of the university, the\nlegates could not obtain consent that a subsidy in any shape should be\ngranted to the pope, although the greater part of the lords, and in\nparticular the princes, were very agreeable to it.\n\nWhile these matters were transacting at Paris, the holy father sent\nletters to the king of France and to the university, to say that\nthe Florentines refused any longer to obey him, from fear of king\nLadislaus; that this king Ladislaus was assembling an immense army,\nas the pope wrote word, to conquer Rome and the adjacent country,\nthat he might place in the chair of St Peter a pope according to his\npleasure. Should this happen, a more ruinous schism might befal the\nchurch than the former one,--to obviate which, he requested from the\nking, the princes, and university, aid and support. This was, through\nthe intercession of the archbishop of Pisa, complied with, and in the\nmanner that shall be hereafter related.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XXIV.\n\n    THE LORD DE CROY IS MADE PRISONER WHEN GOING ON AN EMBASSY\n    FROM THE DUKE OF BURGUNDY TO THE DUKE OF BERRY, TO THE GREAT\n    DISPLEASURE OF THE LATTER.\n\n\nThe duke of Burgundy, shortly after he had left Paris, sent three of\nhis counsellors, namely, the lords de Croy and de Dours, knights, and\nmaster Raoul, head canon of Tournay and of Amiens, licentiate of law,\nas ambassadors to the king at Paris, and to his uncle and godfather,\nthe duke of Berry, at Bourges. But when they were travelling between\nOrleans and Bourges, the lord de Croy was arrested by the officers\nof the duke of Orleans on the last day but one of January, without\nany molestation being given to the other two ambassadors or their\nattendants.\n\nHe was carried to a castle within three leagues of Blois, and, on the\nmorrow, strictly interrogated respecting the murder of the late duke\nof Orleans, and put to the torture to confess if he had been any way\nconsenting to it, or an accomplice in it; but they could not discover\nany thing to his prejudice. On the following Sunday, he was carried to\nBlois, and confined in the dungeons of a prison.\n\nThe other ambassadors continued their route to Bourges, where, having\nexplained to the duke of Berry the object of their mission, they humbly\nentreated that he would exert himself with the duke of Orleans that the\nlord de Croy might obtain his liberty. When they related to him the\nmanner of the lord de Croy being arrested, the duke was filled with\nindignation, and instantly sent letters signed with his hand to the\nduke of Orleans, to say that he must immediately give up his prisoner,\nwhom he had illegally arrested when coming to him; and that if he did\nnot do it, he would have him for his enemy.\n\nThe duke of Orleans, on the receipt of this letter, considered it well,\nand replied at length most courteously to the duke of Berry, excusing\nhimself for what he had done, but putting off the setting the lord de\nCroy at liberty. The king and the duke of Acquitaine were soon made\nacquainted with this arrest,--and they sent letters to the duke of\nOrleans, commanding him instantly to deliver the lord de Croy from his\nimprisonment, on pain of incurring their indignation.\n\nNotwithstanding these letters, the duke of Orleans would not give him\nhis liberty, but kept him in close confinement, where he was very often\nmost rigorously treated, and at times examined and put to the torture.\n\nIn the mean time, the other ambassadors sent messengers to the duke of\nBurgundy, to notify to him this conduct and the means they had taken in\nvain for the deliverance of the lord de Croy.\n\nThe duke was much surprised and vexed at this news, for he greatly\nloved the lord de Croy. Having considered this insult, and others that\nhad been offered to his friends, he thought it time to take effectual\nmeasures for his security, and in consequence amassed as large a sum as\nhe could: to this end, he sold his right to all confiscations within\nthe town of Ghent to the townsmen, and yielded for money several other\nprivileges to the Flemings. He likewise carried his son, the count\nde Charolois, to show him to many of the principal towns as their\nfuture lord, who, on this occasion, made him considerable presents. He\nafterward held a grand council on his affairs, in the town of Tournay,\nwhich was attended by his brothers-in-law duke William and the bishop\nof Liege. The count de Namur was also present, and several great lords\nfrom the borders of the empire. The duke of Burgundy solicited their\naid against his enemies, should need be, and in particular against\nthe duke of Orleans, his brothers and allies. This service they\noffered him liberally, to the utmost of their power. Having obtained\ntheir promises, he went to Lille, whither the marshal Boucicaut, late\ngovernor of Genoa, came to meet him. He received him very kindly, and\ncarried him with him to his town of Arras, whither he had convoked all\nthe lords and nobles of the county of Artois and its dependancies.\n\nWhen they were assembled in the great hall of his residence, he\naddressed them himself, and caused them to be harangued by master\nWilliam Bouvier, knight, licentiate of law, to explain how his enemies\nwere plotting daily to arrest and imprison his friends, and had\nactually arrested and imprisoned the lord de Croy; for which cause he\nhad now assembled them, to request that they would remain loyal, and\nthat, should there be a necessity, they would enter into his pay and\nserve him,--for they might be assured it would be solely in his own\ndefence, and for that of the king and the duke of Acquitaine, that\nhe would ever take up arms. He declared, that it was merely for the\npreservation of the crown to his present majesty, and to his heirs,\nthat he had slain the duke of Orleans, father to the present duke.\nThis death had been lately pardoned, and peace established by the\nking in the town of Chartres, and proclaimed by letters patent. He\nadded, that should any of the conditions of that treaty of Chartres be\nunaccomplished by him, he was ready to fulfil them, and willing to do\nany thing else that would afford satisfaction.\n\nWhen he had concluded his speech, the nobles and knights present\nunanimously replied, that they would serve him to the utmost of their\npower. The meeting then broke up, and each man returned to his own\ncountry and home.\n\nThe marshal Boucicaut went to Paris, and in full council, presided\nby the duke of Acquitaine in the place of his father, he accused the\nGenoese of various crimes, and exculpated himself for having lost that\ntown; and ended by entreating, that he might be sufficiently supplied\nwith men and money to offer them battle and regain it.\n\nThe council deferred giving an answer at the moment, but appointed a\nday for him to receive it. In the mean time, Boucicaut waited on all\nthe principal lords, to interest them in his cause, and to beg that\nthey would press the king and council to hasten a compliance with his\nrequest. It was ordered by the council, conjunctively with the three\nestates, that the Genoese should be summoned to appear before them at\nParis, at the feast of Easter, when many of the nobles would be there\nassembled on other weighty affairs, particularly to have their consent\nthat the duke of Acquitaine should be appointed regent of the kingdom,\nfor the Parisians were extremely pressing that this should be done.\n\nThe duke of Berry, however, was much displeased when he heard of it,\nand, to prevent it, wrote urgent letters to the duke of Acquitaine, to\nthe queen, and to the great council, giving substantial reasons why\nthis could not and ought not to be done, considering how very young the\nduke of Acquitaine was,--adding, that he and his brother Philip duke of\nBurgundy, of good memory, had sworn on the holy sacrament that they\nwould support and defend, to their last drop of blood, their nephew,\nthe king now on the throne, against all who should attempt any thing to\nhis dishonour or disadvantage.\n\nWhile these things were in agitation, the king recovered his\nhealth,--and of course, the duke of Acquitaine was not regent, to the\ngreat satisfaction of the duke of Berry, who was much rejoiced thereat.\n\nIn consequence of the quarrel that had now again broken out between the\ndukes of Orleans and Burgundy, the king issued a proclamation to all\nthe bailiwicks, provostships, seneschalships and governments in his\nrealm, to forbid all nobles, of whatever rank they might be, and every\nother person, to obey the summons or join in arms either of the above\ndukes, under pain of their property being confiscated.\n\nOn the Wednesday of the holy week, the duke of Bourbon and the count\nde Vertus, brother to the duke of Orleans, marched five hundred men at\narms to Clermont in Beauvoisis, and thence invaded Normandy. The count\nde Vertus did not remain long there, but, taking a part of the men at\narms, left the duke of Bourbon, and hastened to the countries of the\nSoissonnois and Valois, to the territory of Coucy, which belonged to\nhis brother, and there placed a good garrison.\n\nTrue it is, that when the duke of Burgundy heard this, he was much\ntroubled, and, as speedily as he could, ordered his men at arms to meet\nhim at Ch\u00e2teau-Cambresis the last day but one of April. But when these\ntransactions came to the knowledge of the king and council, he sent\nable ambassadors to each of these dukes, to forbid them, under pain of\nhaving all their lands confiscated, and being declared enemies to their\nking and country, to attempt any expeditions against each other, and\ncommanded them instantly to disband their forces. For this time they\nvery humbly obeyed his orders, and deferred proceeding further for a\nconsiderable space.\n\n\n\n\n[A. D. 1411.]\n\nCHAP. XXV.\n\n    THE DUKE OF ORLEANS SENDS AMBASSADORS TO THE KING OF FRANCE,\n    WITH LETTERS OF ACCUSATION AGAINST THE DUKE OF BURGUNDY AND\n    THOSE OF HIS PARTY.\n\n\nAt the commencement of this year, the duke of Orleans was displeased\nthat those ministers who had been nominated by the duke of Burgundy had\ngreater influence than any of the others, and that they daily deprived\nsuch as had been attached to the late duke of Orleans, and were now\nhis friends, of their offices. In consequence, he sent ambassadors\nto the king to complain of this conduct, and to require that the\nmurderers of his father should be punished conformably to the articles\nof the treaty, but who were now residents within the kingdom. To these\nambassadors promises were made, on the part of the king, that proper\nremedies should be applied to give them satisfaction.\n\nOn their departure, the king sent to his uncle, the duke of Berry, at\nBourges, to require that he would interfere between his two nephews of\nOrleans and Burgundy, and make peace between them, which he engaged\nto do; and in consequence, he sent his chancellor, the archbishop of\nBourges, to Paris, well instructed by the duke how he was to act.\n\nShortly after, this chancellor, the marshal Boucicaut, with others,\nwere dispatched to the duke of Burgundy, then at St Omer, who, having\nheard all they had to say, replied, that it was no fault of his, nor\nshould it ever be so, that any articles of the late treaties were\ninfringed; for that in this, and in every thing else, he was very\ndesirous of obeying the king. And this his answer they laid before the\nking and council.\n\nBut as the proceedings against the murderers of the late duke of\nOrleans did not seem to his son, and his advisers, to be carried on\nwith sufficient vigour, he wrote letters, signed with his own hand, to\ncomplain of this and other matters to the king, the contents of which\nwere as follows:\n\n\u2018Most redoubted lord, after offering my humble recommendation,--lately,\nvery redoubted lord, two of your counsellors came to me, namely, sir\nCollart de Charleville, knight, and sir Simon de Nanterre, president of\nyour parliament, whom you had been pleased to send me to signify and\nexplain your good will and pleasure touching certain points, which they\nhave clearly and distinctly declared, according to the terms of their\ncommission.\n\n\u2018First, they require and entreat of me, in your name, who may command\nme as your loyal subject and humble servant, that I should submit the\nquarrel that subsists between me and the duke of Burgundy, for the\ninhuman and cruel murder of my very redoubted lord and father, and your\nown brother, on whose soul may God have mercy! to my lady the queen,\nand to my lord and uncle the duke of Berry, who has been in like manner\nsolicited by your ambassadors to labour diligently to establish a firm\npeace, for the general good of the kingdom.\n\n\u2018They have informed me, that you have also made a similar proposal to\nthe duke of Burgundy,--and that, to effectuate so desirable an object\nas peace, I should send four of my friends to my said uncle of Berry,\nwho will there meet the same number from the duke of Burgundy.\n\n\u2018The second point mentioned by them is, that you entreat I would desist\nfrom assembling men at arms.\n\n\u2018Thirdly, that I would accept of letters from you similar to those\nwhich had been formerly sent me at my request, respecting the\nmurderers, and their accomplices, of my late father and your brother.\n\n\u2018Having very maturely weighed and considered the above points, I reply,\nthat I most humbly thank you, very redoubted lord, for your grace and\nkindness in thus sending to me; and I can assure you, that I have no\ngreater pleasure than in hearing often from you, and of your noble\nstate; that I was, and am always ready to serve and obey you in body\nand fortune, to the utmost extent of my own and my subjects\u2019 abilities.\n\n\u2018But as the matters which they have mentioned to me in your name are\nof very high consideration and importance, concerning yourself and\nyour noble state, and as I shall ever be most anxious to show my ready\nobedience to your will, I was unable at the moment to make them any\nreply, excepting that I would send you an answer as speedily as I\ncould. This I have hitherto deferred, for I know you have near your\nperson, and in your council, several of my bitter enemies, whom you\nought to regard as yours also, and to whom I am unwilling that my\nanswer, or my future intentions, should be made known: neither is it\nright they should be made acquainted with what concerns me, or have the\nopportunity of giving their opinions in council, or elsewhere, relative\nthereto.\n\n\u2018I therefore assure you, most redoubted lord, in the fullest manner,\nthat I am your humble son and nephew, ready at all times to obey you\nas my sovereign lord, and most heartily anxious to honour and exalt to\nthe utmost of my power your crown and dignity, as well as that of the\nqueen, the duke of Acquitaine, and all your other children and kingdom,\nand to advise you most loyally and faithfully, without ever concealing\nany thing from you that may tend to the glory of your crown, or to the\nwelfare of your realm.\n\n\u2018I have some time hesitated to denounce to you such of my enemies, and\nyours also, as are in your council and service, namely, the bishop of\nTournay, the vidame d\u2019Amiens, John de Neelles[67], the lord de Heilly,\nCharles de Savoisy, Anthony des Essars, John de Courcelles, Peter de\nFontenay and Maurice de Railly, who, by force or underhand means, are\ncapable of doing me great mischief, insomuch that they have dismissed\ncertain very able men from their offices, who were your trusty\nservants, and have done them very great and irreparable damages: they\nare guilty also of insinuating very many falsehoods, to keep myself and\nothers, your relations and faithful servants, at a distance from you,\nby which, and other means equally dishonourable and iniquitous, long\nfollowed by them and their adherents, have they troubled the peace of\nthe kingdom: nor is it very probable that so long as such persons shall\nremain in power, and in your service, any firm or lasting peace can be\nestablished; for they will always prevent you from doing justice to\nmyself or to others, which ought indifferently to be done to all,--to\nthe poor as well as to the rich.\n\n\u2018This conduct they pursue, because they know themselves guilty of many\ncrimes, and especially John de Neelles and the lord de Heilly, who were\naccomplices in the murder of my late honoured father, and your only\nbrother, under the protection of the duke of Burgundy, the principal\nin this crime. They are his sworn servants and pensioners, or allies\nto the said duke, whence they may be reputed actors and accomplices in\nthis base and cowardly assassination. These accomplices, most redoubted\nlord, appear daily in your presence, and you ought to consider their\ncrimes in the same light as if done personally against you, for indeed\nyour authority was set at nought.\n\n\u2018That I may now say all that I know, I am satisfied, that had not the\ncourse of your justice been checked by the aforesaid persons and their\naccomplices, ample justice would have been done for the death of my\nlord and father, and your brother, with the aid of your officers and\nloyal subjects, as I know for certain that they were well inclined to\nit.\n\n\u2018For this I am very thankful; and I most earnestly pray you, for your\nown honour, for that of the queen and of the duke of Acquitaine, as\nwell as for the honour of your kingdom, that you would do good and fair\njustice, by causing these guilty persons to be arrested and punished,\nsince they are equally your enemies as mine,--and that you would not\nlonger admit to your presence and councils the partisans of the duke of\nBurgundy, but select in their places good, loyal, and able men, such as\nmay be found in abundance in your kingdom.\n\n\u2018When these things shall be done, I will then, under God\u2019s pleasure,\nsend you such answer, that you may clearly know my inmost thoughts, and\nwhich shall prove satisfactory to God, to yourself, and to the world.\nFor the love of God, I pray you, my most redoubted lord, do not neglect\ndoing this; otherwise I see plainly, that whatever supplications or\nrequests I make to you will never be attended to, although they be\nconformable to reason and justice, and that you will be prevented from\nacting in the manner you have proposed, through your ambassadors to me,\nnor shall I be able to do what they have required from me on your part.\n\n\u2018Therefore, my most redoubted lord, I beg you will not disappoint\nme; for what I have required is but just and reasonable, as will be\napparent to any one. My very dear lord, may it please you to order me\naccording to your good pleasure, and, with the will of God, I will obey\nyou faithfully in all things.\u2019\n\nWhen the duke of Orleans had sent this letter to the king, he wrote\nothers of the like tenour to the chancellor of France, and to such\nof the ministers as he knew were favourable to him, to entreat that\nthey would earnestly exert themselves in pressing the king, queen, and\nduke of Acquitaine, to dismiss those of the council who governed under\nthe name of the duke of Burgundy, and whose names have been already\nnoticed,--and that he might obtain justice on the murderers of his\nlate father. Notwithstanding the many attempts he made by repeated\nletters to the king and to others, he could not at that time, through\nthe interposition before mentioned, obtain any answer which was\nsatisfactory.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XXVI.\n\n    THE DEATH OF THE DUKE OF BAR.--THE KING OF FRANCE SENDS AN\n    EMBASSY TO THE DUKE OF BURGUNDY,--AND OTHER MATTERS.\n\n\nIn this year died that valiant and wise man Henry duke of Bar, and was\nsucceeded by his eldest son Edward, marquis du Pont, in the duchy of\nBar and castlewick of Cassel, excepting a part which he had bequeathed\nas an inheritance, after his decease, to Robert de Bar, son to the\ndeceased Henry de Bar, his eldest son, and to the lady de Coucy,\nnamely, Varneston, Bourbourg, Dunkirk and Rhodes[68]. In consequence\nof his death, Edward was styled Duke of Bar, and began his reign\nprosperously.\n\nAt this period, the king of France sent ambassadors to the duke of\nBurgundy, who, beside what they delivered to him in speech, gave\nhim the letters which the duke of Orleans had written to the king,\ncontaining his charges against him and his accomplices. He was much\ndispleased at this conduct, and made reply by these ambassadors, that\nthe charges brought against him by the duke of Orleans were untrue.\nWhen he had received the ambassadors with every honour, he took leave\nof them, and went to his county of Flanders: and they returned to\nParis without any satisfactory answer to the matters concerning which\nthey had been sent.\n\nIt was not long before the duke of Burgundy raised a large body of men\nat arms, whom he sent into the Cambresis, and toward St Quentin; but\nimmediately after, by orders from the king and council, he dismissed\nthem to the places whence they had come.\n\nOn the 15th day of July, master John Petit, doctor of divinity, whom\nthe duke of Orleans had intended to prosecute, before the university\nof Paris, for heresy, died in the town of Hesdin, in the h\u00f4tel of\nthe hospital which the duke of Burgundy had given him, beside large\npensions, and was buried in the church of the Friars Minors in the town\nof Hesdin.\n\nAt this time, a tax was laid on the clergy of France and of Dauphiny,\nof half a tenth, by the pope, with the consent of the king, the\nprinces, and the university of Paris, and the greater part of the\nprelates and cities, to be paid by two instalments; the first on\nMagdalen day, and the second at Whitsuntide following. It was so\nrigorously collected that the poorer clergy complained bitterly.\n\nDuring this transaction, and while the duke of Burgundy was resident\nin his town of Bruges, on Saturday the 10th of July, sir Am\u00e9 de\nSarrebrusse, sir Clugnet de Brabant, and other captains of the duke of\nOrleans, came, with a numerous body of men at arms, before Coucy, in\nthe Vermandois, and Ham sur Somme.\n\nNews of this was soon carried to the duke of Burgundy, who, suspecting\nthey intended to invade and make war on his territories, gave\ncommissions to several of his captains, namely, the lord de Heilly,\nEnguerrand de Bournouville, the lord de Ront, and some others, to march\na body of men at arms towards Bapaume and Ham, to oppose the Armagnacs,\nshould they attempt to penetrate further into the country.\n\nDuring this time, the duke of Orleans and his brothers continued their\nsolicitations for justice, and again sent letters to the king, princes,\ncities, and prelates, to engage them to unite with them in obtaining\nthe object of their petitions. The tenour of the letter they wrote to\nthe king is as follows.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XXVII.\n\n    THE DUKE OF ORLEANS AND HIS BROTHERS SEND LETTERS TO THE KING\n    OF FRANCE, TO OTHER LORDS, AND TO SEVERAL OF THE PRINCIPAL\n    TOWNS IN FRANCE, TO COMPLAIN OF THE DUKE OF BURGUNDY.\n\n\n\u2018Most redoubted and sovereign lord,--we Charles duke of Orleans,\nPhilip count de Vertus, and John count of Angoul\u00eame, brothers, your\nvery humble children and nephews, have, with all due humiliation\nand submission, considered it right to lay before you, jointly and\nseparately, what follows.\n\n\u2018Although the barbarous and cruel murder of our redoubted lord and very\ndear father, your brother, must for certain be most strongly impressed\non your royal memory, and engraven on your heart,--nevertheless, most\nredoubted lord, our grief and the sense of what is due to us from all\nlaws, human and divine, force us to renew in your memory all the minute\ntransactions of that inhuman event.\n\n\u2018It is a fact, most dear lord, that John, who styles himself duke\nof Burgundy, through a hatred he had long nourished in his breast,\nand from an insatiate ambition and a desire of governing your realm,\nand that he might have the office of regent, as he has clearly shown\nand daily continues to show, did, on the 14th day of November in the\nyear 1407, most treacherously murder your brother, our most renowned\nlord and father, in the streets of Paris, and during the night, by\ncausing him to be waylaid by a set of infamous wretches, hired for this\npurpose, without having previously testified any displeasure towards\nhim. This is well known to all the world; for it has been publicly\navowed by the traitorous murderer himself, who is more disloyal, cruel,\nand inhuman than you can imagine; and we do not believe you can find in\nany writings one of a more perverse or faithless character.\n\n\u2018In the first place, they were so nearly connected by blood, being\ncousins-german, the children of two brothers, that it adds to his crime\nof murder that of parricide; and the laws cannot too severely punish\nso detestable an action. They were also brothers in arms, having twice\nor thrice renewed this confederation under their own hands and seals,\nand solemnly sworn on the holy sacrament, in the presence of very many\nprelates and nobles, that they would be true and loyal friends,--that\nthey would not do any thing to the prejudice of each other, either\nopenly or secretly, nor suffer any such like thing to be done by others.\n\n\u2018They, besides, entered into various protestations of love and\nfriendship, making the most solemn promises to continue true brothers\nin arms, as is usual in such cases, to demonstrate that they felt a\nperfect friendship for each other; and as a confirmation of their\naffection, they mutually wore each other\u2019s colours and badges.\n\n\u2018Secondly, he proved the perverseness of his heart by the manner in\nwhich this murder was committed. Under cover of his pretended affection\nfor your aforesaid brother, he conversed frequently with him; and once\nwhen he was ill, a short time before his death, he visited him at his\nhouse of Beaut\u00e9 sur Marne, and in Paris, showing him every sign of love\nand friendship that brother, cousin, or friend could testify,--when,\nat the same time, he had plotted his death, had sent for the murderers\nto Paris, and had even hired the house to hide them in, which clearly\ndemonstrates the wickedness and disloyalty of his heart.\n\n\u2018In addition to what I have just stated, and the very day before the\nmurder took place, after the council which you had held at the h\u00f4tel\nde St Pol was broken up, they both, in your presence and before the\nother princes of the blood who were there, drank wine and ate together;\nand your brother invited him to dine with him the Sunday following.\nThe duke of Burgundy accepted the invitation, although he knew what\na diabolical attempt he harboured in his heart, and that it would be\nput into effect the very first favourable opportunity. This is an\nabomination disgraceful even to relate.\n\n\u2018On the morrow, therefore, notwithstanding all his fair promises and\noaths, being obstinately bent upon his wicked purpose, he caused him to\nbe put to death with more cruelty than ever man of any rank suffered,\nby those whom he had hired to waylay and murder him, and who had, for\na long time, been watching their opportunity. They first cut off his\nright hand, which was found the next day in the dirt: they then cut his\nleft arm so that it held only by the skin, and, beside, fractured and\nlaid open his skull in several places that his brains were scattered\nin the street; and they then dragged his body through the mud, until it\nwas quite lifeless.\n\n\u2018It would be pitiful to hear of such barbarous conduct towards the\nmeanest subject: how much the more horror must the recital cause, when\nit was practised on the first prince of the blood of France! Never was\nany branch of your noble race so cruelly and infamously treated,--and\nyou and all of your blood, and such of your subjects as wish you well,\nought not to suffer such a lamentable deed to be perpetrated without\nany punishment or reparation whatever, as is the case till this present\ntime, which is the most shameful thing that ever happened, or ever\ncould happen, to so noble a house; and additional disgrace will fall\nupon it, if you any longer delay justice.\n\n\u2018Thirdly, he shows his perverseness and obstinacy by false and damnable\nhypocrisy; for after the horrid deed had been done, he came with the\nother princes dressed in black, to attend the body, pretending the\nutmost grief at the funeral for the loss of his brother in arms,\nthinking by this means to cover the wickedness of his sin. It would be\ntiresome to relate all the damnable and hypocritical arts he employed\nto hide the treacherous and murderous part he had acted, until he\nperceived that his crime must be brought to light by the diligence of\nyour officers of justice.\n\n\u2018He then, and then only, confessed to the king of Sicily, and to the\nduke of Berry, that he had perpetrated this murder, or at least had\ncaused it to be committed; and that the devil had tempted him to do\nit, for that in truth he could not assign any other cause for having\nso done. But he was not contented with murdering his body: he wanted\nagain, so great is his iniquity, to murder his fame and fair reputation\nby false and wicked accusations, when he was no more able to defend\nhimself against them. The falsehood of these charges, through the grace\nof God, is notorious to you and to the whole world.\n\n\u2018My late most redoubted lady-mother, whose soul may God receive!\nsuffered the utmost tribulation, not only for the death of her\nmuch-beloved lord and husband, but also for the inhuman and cruel\nmanner of it; and like one in despair, attended by me, John of\nAngoul\u00eame, she waited on you, as her king and sovereign lord, and\nher sole refuge in this her distress, and most humbly supplicated\nthat you would, out of your benign goodness, have compassion on her\nand her children, and would order such prompt and just judgment to\nbe executed on the perpetrators of this murder as the blackness of\nthe case required; and as you are bound in your quality of king to\nadminister strict justice to all your subjects without delay, as well\nto the poor as to the rich, so rather the more promptly ought you to\nexercise it in favour of the poor and deserted than for the rich and\npowerful; for this upright administration of justice is a great virtue,\nand on this account were kings chiefly appointed, and power intrusted\nto their hands. The case that was then and is now again brought before\nyou requires the most speedy justice; for it not only concerns you as\nking, but affects you more sensibly and personally,--for her husband,\nour much regretted lord, who was so treacherously slain, was your only\nbrother, and, consequently, strict justice ought to have been granted\nto her, and done on the murderers.\n\n\u2018You did indeed appoint a day for doing her this justice; on which\naccount, she constantly employed her agents near your person, to\nremind you thereof: she waited long after the appointed day had elapsed\nfor the judgment which you had promised her,--and, notwithstanding all\nher diligence and exertions, she met with nothing but delays, caused by\nthe means of the aforesaid traitor, his friends and adherents, as shall\nbe more fully explained hereafter.\n\n\u2018However, most redoubted lord, I know for certain, that your\ninclinations were very willing to do us justice, and that they still\nremain the same. Our most afflicted mother, attended by me Charles of\nOrleans, again returned; and we renewed our request to have judgment\nexecuted on the assassins of our late lord and father. We also caused\nto be most fully detailed before my lord of Acquitaine, your eldest\nson, and by you commissioned as your lieutenant on this occasion, and\nbefore the queen, every circumstance relative to the murder, and the\ninfamous charges urged by way of exculpation by the murderer, and the\ncauses why he had committed this atrocious crime. We, at the same time,\nfully replied to what had been argued in his defence; and after this,\nour lady-mother caused conclusions to be drawn against the aforesaid\ntraitor, according to the usual customs of your reign, and required\nthat your attorney should join with her in the further prosecution of\nthe criminals, so that they might be brought to justice.\n\n\u2018When this was done, our very redoubted lord the duke of Acquitaine,\nby the advice of the princes of your blood and divers others of your\ncouncil, then present at the Louvre, made answer to our lady-mother,\nthat, as your lieutenant, he and the princes of the blood, and\nthe members of your council, were satisfied, and pleased with the\njustifications offered by our lady-mother in behalf of your brother,\nour much redoubted father, whose soul may God pardon! and that they\nconsidered him as fully innocent of the charges brought against him,\nand added, that substantial justice should be done to her satisfaction.\n\n\u2018Notwithstanding all these promises, there was much delay in their\nexecution, insomuch that she frequently renewed her solicitations\nto you, the princes of your blood, and to your council, and used\nvarious other means to obtain justice, the recital of which would\ntire you: nevertheless, she could never gain the assistance of your\nattorney-general in prosecuting the aforesaid criminals to judgment,\nwhich circumstance is lamentable to think on.\n\n\u2018For the aforesaid traitor, well knowing your inclination to execute\njustice, knowing also that his crime could by no means be justified, in\norder to prevent matters being pushed to extremity, (notwithstanding\nyour positive orders to him, to forbid his appearing at Paris, with any\nbody of men at arms) came thither with a powerful force, composed of\nforeigners, and several who had been banished your realm, who did great\nmischief to the countries through which they passed, as is notorious to\nevery one.\n\n\u2018Your and our lady the queen, with the duke of Acquitaine, your son\nand heir, and the princes of the blood, were forced to quit your\ncapital before he arrived there. He remained, therefore, in your\ntown of Paris lord paramount, and conducted himself in a tyrannical\nmanner, subversive of your dominion, and contrary to the interests\nof the people. To avoid greater inconveniences and oppressions on\nyour subjects from him and his men at arms, it was judged expedient\nthat you, the royal family and council of state should, according to\nhis good pleasure, come to Chartres, and there grant him whatever\nhe should ask. Thus he thought he should be acquitted of all the\ntraitorous acts and murders which he had committed, by trampling your\njustice under his feet. Consequently he refuses to suffer any of your\nofficers to take cognizance of his crimes, and has not condescended to\nhumiliate himself before you, whom he has troubled and offended more\nthan can be told. He is not, therefore, capable of receiving any grace\nby law or reason; nor worthy of being admitted to your presence, and\nhaving any favours shown to him or to his dependants and friends. He\nshould have presented himself before you in all humility and contrition\nfor his offences; whereas he has done precisely the contrary, and has\nso obstinately persisted in his wickedness that he has had the boldness\nto avow to yourself publicly, and before so great an assembly as met at\nChartres, that he put your only brother to death for your welfare and\nthat of the state.\n\n\u2018He wishes also to maintain, that you told him you were not displeased\nthat it had been done. This has shocked every loyal ear that has heard\nit, and will shock still more the generations to come, who shall read\nand learn that a king of France (the greatest monarch in Christendom)\nshould not have been displeased at the most inhuman and traitorous\nmurder of his only brother.\n\n\u2018This is so manifestly treason of the deepest die against your\nown honour, and that of your crown and kingdom, that scarcely any\npunishments ordered by law and justice are capable of making reparation\nfor it. It is also greatly prejudicial to the far-famed justice of your\ncourts of law.\n\n\u2018Notwithstanding the excuses which he made to you, that the murder\nof your brother had been committed for your personal security, and\nthe good of your kingdom, it is notorious, that it had been plotted\na very long time, through his immeasurable ambition of obtaining the\ngovernment of your realm, as I have before stated. He has declared to\nseveral of his dependants and officers, that there never before was\ncommitted in this country so base a murder; and yet, in his defence, he\nsays it was done for the public good, and for your personal safety.\n\n\u2018It is therefore very clear, according to law and equity, that every\nthing done at Chartres on that day is null and void; and what perhaps\nis as deserving of punishment as the commission of the crime itself\nis, that he never deigned to pay you any honour, respect, or condolence\nfor such a loss as that of your brother, nor ever once solicited\npardon, or any remission for his offence whatever. And he wishes to\nmaintain, that without confessing his guilt, and without demanding\npardon, you have remitted all further proceedings against him, which is\ncontrary to all equity and written laws,--a mere illusion, or rather a\nderision of justice, namely, thus to leave a murderer, without taking\nany cognizance of his crime, without penitence or contrition, and\nto prosecute no inquiry into his conduct, and, what is worse, when\nsuch a criminal obstinately perseveres in his wickedness, even in the\npresence of his sovereign lord. On that same day, however, he fell\ninto a manifest and apparent contradiction; for he says that he has\ndone well, and consequently he assumes to himself merit, and requires\nremuneration,--and, nevertheless, he pretends to say that you have\ngiven him pardon and remission, which circumstance implies not good\ndeeds and merit, but a crime and offence.\n\n\u2018He has never offered any prayers for the salvation of the soul of the\ndeceased, nor any remuneration to those who have suffered from the\nloss caused by him; and this you ought not, and cannot in any manner\npardon.\n\n\u2018Thus it clearly appears, that what was done at Chartres was contrary\nto every principle of law, equity, reason and justice; whence it again\nfollows, that from this, and other causes too long to be detailed, all\nthe proceedings at Chartres are null and of no effect. Should any one\nmaintain, that the treaty made at Chartres is good and binding, it may\nvery easily be shown, that this aforesaid traitor has infringed the\narticles of it in various ways, and has been the first to violate it.\n\n\u2018Although you had ordered, that henceforth he should in no way act to\nour prejudice, and although he had sworn to observe it,--nevertheless\nhe did directly the contrary; for, thinking to damn the good fame of\nour very redoubted lord and father, he caused your grand master of\nthe household, whose soul may God receive! to be arrested, thrown\ninto close imprisonment, and inhumanly tortured, so that his limbs\nwere broken, and made him suffer other martyrdom that he might,\nthrough the severity of torture, force him to confess that our\never-to-be-regretted lord and father, and your only brother, whose\nsoul may God pardon! was guilty of some of the charges which he had\nfalsely brought against him, so that his crimes might be excused, and\nthat he might for ever destroy the honour of our family.\n\n\u2018He had the grand master carried to the place of execution, who there,\nwhen death was before his eyes, declared, on the damnation of his soul\nif he told a falsehood, that he had never in his life seen any thing\ntreasonable in the conduct of the late duke of Orleans, or any thing\nthat tended to the hurt of any individual,--but that he had always most\nloyally served you: and should he have said any thing to the contrary\nwhen under torture, it must have been his sufferings that forced him to\nutter what he thought would please his tormentors. What he now said was\nthe real truth, and he uttered it on the peril of damnation; and this\nhe persevered in to the moment of his execution, in the hearing of many\nknights and other respectable persons.\n\n\u2018This plainly demonstrates, that the duke of Burgundy\u2019s conduct was\nprecisely the reverse to what he had sworn to observe when at Chartres.\n\n\u2018He has received into his h\u00f4tel and supported, and continues daily\nso to do, the murderers who slew your brother, although they were\nespecially excepted out of the treaty concluded at Chartres. He\nlikewise, as is notorious, troubles the officers and servants of our\nlate lord and father, who now appertain to us, and dismisses them from\nall the employments which they held under your government, without any\nother cause whatever but his hatred to us and to our house, and to\nthose servants who are attached to us. He even attempted not only to\nruin them in their fortunes, but to take away their lives by means too\ntedious to relate; but the facts are notorious.\n\n\u2018The traitor, therefore, sensible of the horror of his criminal\ncruelty, and that he could not by any means palliate it, has usurped\nthe government of your kingdom (for the sole cause of his murdering\nyour brother was his unbounded ambition),--and, by so doing,\neffectually prevents your officers of justice from taking cognizance\nof his crimes, and likewise creates infinite grief to all your loyal\nsubjects and wellwishers.\n\n\u2018He detains your royal person, as well as that of my lord the duke of\nAcquitaine, in such subjection that no one, however high his rank, can\nhave access to you, whatever may be his business, without first having\nobtained permission from those whom he has placed around you, and has\nthus driven from you and your family several faithful and valiant\nservants long attached to you, and filled their places with his own\ncreatures, and in great part with foreigners and persons unknown to\nyou. In like manner, he has acted toward my lord of Acquitaine.\n\n\u2018He has also displaced your officers,--in particular, such as held\nthe principal posts in your realm; and as for your finances, he has\nlavished them here and there according to his will and pleasure, but\ngreatly to his own advantage, and not at all for the good of yourself,\nor for the relief of your people, which has caused much discontent\nagainst you. The underlings in office he has sorely vexed, under\nfeigned pretences of justice, and has robbed them of their fortunes,\nwhich he has applied to his own proper use, as is well known throughout\nParis and elsewhere.\n\n\u2018In short, he has introduced such a licentiousness of manners into the\nkingdom that all sorts of crimes are committed, without inquiry or\npunishment following them; and thus, from default or neglect of justice\nbeing done on this enormous and detestable murderer, many other murders\nhave been committed with impunity in different parts of the realm,\nsince the melancholy death of our much-regretted lord and father,\nmurderers and other criminals saying, \u2018Our crimes will be passed over,\nsince no notice has been taken of him who slew the king\u2019s brother.\u2019\n\n\u2018On this account, most redoubted lord, my lord of Berry your uncle,\nthe duke of Bourbon, the count d\u2019Alen\u00e7on, the counts de Clermont and\nd\u2019Armagnac, and I Charles of Orleans, wishing to testify our loyalty to\nyou, as we are bound by parentage, and being your very humble subjects,\nhad intended coming to you last year to lay before you the damnable\ngovernment of your kingdom, and to remonstrate, that should it continue\nlonger, it must end in the destruction of yourself, your family, and\nyour realm.\n\n\u2018In order, therefore, that you may hear us as well as such as may\nmaintain the contrary, let there be chosen a sufficient number of\ndiscreet men to examine into the grievances we complain of; and let a\nremedy be applied to them, providing first for the security of your\nroyal person, and for that of my lord of Acquitaine. This was more\nfully explained in the proclamations issued previously to our coming\nto Paris, when, for our personal safety, we were accompanied by our\nfriends and vassals, all of them your subjects; and our only object in\nthus coming was the welfare of yourself and your kingdom.\n\n\u2018We offered to wait on you with very few attendants, but we could\nnever obtain access to you, nor have a single audience, through the\nobstructions of this traitor, who was alway by your side; and he alone\nprevented the goodness of our intentions being made known to you,\nfrom his persevering ambition and his boundless desire of seizing the\ngovernment of yourself and realm.\n\n\u2018We, therefore, finding all hopes of seeing you fruitless, in\nconsequence of agreements concluded with your council, returned home;\nbut to avoid, if possible, the destruction of your country, we must\nagain confederate.--We faithfully observed all the articles of the\nagreement; but we were no sooner at a distance than our enemy violated\nthem in the most essential part. It had been settled that your new\nministry should be composed of men of unblemished characters, who were\nnot partisans or servants, or pensioners to either side; but he has\nkept those that were attached to him in power, so that he has now a\nmajority in the council, and consequently rules more despotically and\nmore securely than when he held the reins of government in his own hand.\n\n\u2018These grievances are increasing, and will increase, unless God shall\ndirect your mind to provide a remedy to them.\n\n\u2018Pierre des Essars, who had been provost of your good town of Paris,\nand minister of finance, was to be deprived of these offices, and of\nevery employment he held under your name. This was done for a short\ntime,--but he has since obtained for him, by letters sealed with\nyour great seal, a re-appointment to the provostship, under pretence\nof which the said Pierre des Essars has returned to Paris, and has\nattempted by force to execute the duties of that office. He came, in\nfact, to the court of the Ch\u00e2telet, seated himself on the judgment\nseat, and took possession of his office with the knowledge and\nconnivance of the duke of Burgundy,--and it was not his fault, if he\nfailed in success.\n\n\u2018Hence it appears plainly, that the late arrangements have been by\nhim, and those of his party, violated; and that he never had any real\nintentions of keeping the treaty is clear from his having consented to\nthe dismission of Pierre des Essars, and then secretly procuring his\nrestitution. It was also stipulated in this treaty, that all who had\nbeen deprived of their offices for having been in the company of me,\nCharles d\u2019Orleans, and the other lords, at the h\u00f4tel of Winchester,\nshould be restored to them; and that, by your orders, and those of your\ncouncil, sir John de Charencieres was to be replaced in his government\nof your town and castle of Caen,--nevertheless, the duke of Burgundy,\nin opposition to these your orders, had him displaced, and solicited\nthe appointment for himself, from hatred to sir John de Charencieres,\nand, having obtained it, now holds it, which is another infringement of\nthe treaty.\n\n\u2018Notwithstanding, most redoubted lord and sovereign, all the diligence\nand exertions made by our much-loved mother, whose soul may God\npardon! to obtain justice on the murderers of our late very dear\nfather, four years have now elapsed without any judgment being passed\non such enormous criminals, although she pursued every means in her\npower.\n\n\u2018In consequence of this failure or neglect, I, Charles of Orleans, have\nof late most humbly supplicated you to grant me warrants against these\naforesaid murderers, addressed to all your justices, that they might,\non due examination of the charges, imprison and punish, according to\nthe exigency of the case, all or any who may have been implicated in\nthis abominable crime. In this I made not any extraordinary request;\nfor justice is due to all your subjects, and cannot be refused them:\nyou cannot believe that any man, however low his rank, in your kingdom,\nwould have a similar request neglected by your courts of justice, for\nI know it could not be refused. However, in spite of every exertion I\ncould make, I have never yet been able to obtain these warrants, the\nreason of which is, as I suppose, that some of your new ministers are\nimplicated in the crime I am anxious to have punished, and therefore\nwill not suffer such warrants to be issued.\n\n\u2018For this reason, therefore, most redoubted lord, have I of\nlate earnestly supplicated you, that you would, from personal\nconsiderations, and for the good of your realm, dismiss from your\nservice the persons named in my letter,--for I therein charged them\nwith having obstructed public justice and disturbed the peace of the\ncountry. When this should be done, I declared to your ambassadors,\nthat I was willing, from my love to your person and attachment to your\nkingdom, to make publicly known my future intentions, and that my\nconduct should be such as would have the approbation of God and of your\nmajesty; but notwithstanding this, I have not yet had any satisfactory\nanswer to all my repeated solicitations for justice on the murderers of\nmy late regretted lord and father.\n\n\u2018We, therefore, most redoubted lord, again make our petitions that the\naforesaid criminals may be brought to that justice which is due to them\nfor the enormity of their offences; the principal having made a public\nconfession of his guilt in the presence of my lord of Acquitaine, who\npresided, in your absence, at the meeting held at his request in the\nh\u00f4tel de St Pol, and before a numerous body of the nobility, clergy\nand others; and the traitor cannot deny that this his confession was\nmade before a competent judge, and in the presence of such witnesses as\nthe king of Sicily and my lord of Berry your uncle.\n\n\u2018He had before privately confessed to these two persons, that he had\ncommitted the murder without any cause whatever, but through the\ninstigation of the enemy of mankind. This confession, according to\nevery law, ought to be to his prejudice, nor should he be suffered to\noffer any excuse in extenuation of a crime thus publicly and privately\navowed; for he has condemned himself, and ought to have judgment passed\non him accordingly.\n\n\u2018It is very apparent, that such confession requires not any further\nproceedings but the passing of that sentence which the enormity of the\ncrime deserves. Notwithstanding this, our much-regretted lady-mother\nand ourselves have never been able, with all our exertions, to overcome\nthe premeditated delays to obstruct justice; for three years and a half\nare elapsed since we first brought the matter before you, and we are\nnot one step more advanced to the attainment of judgment than we were\nthen. It is painful to consider what may be the consequence of this\nwilful delay of justice to the welfare of your kingdom, and that the\nmost dangerous consequences may ensue, unless a speedy and decisive\nremedy be applied.\n\n\u2018May it therefore please your grace to do your loyal duty, in executing\nthis act of justice, in obedience to God your Creator, to whom judgment\nappertains, and from whom you hold your authority. Have regard also to\nthe good government of your realm, and exert yourself to put an end\nto every obstacle in the way of a just punishment on the traitor. We\nmost earnestly supplicate you to comply with this our request as soon\nas possible, for we are bounden to press you to it, to the utmost of\nour powers, under pain of not being reputed the children of our late\nlamented father, and of being disgraced, and unworthy of bearing his\nname and arms, and of succeeding to his honours and estates: such\ndishonour we will never endure, but would rather suffer death, as ought\nto be the determination of every man of noble heart, of whatever rank\nor estate he may be.\n\n\u2018We therefore entreat you, with all possible humility, that for this\npurpose, and also in order to resist and oppose his wicked intention\nto destroy us by any means whatsoever, it may please you, from your\nbenignant grace, to aid, assist and abet by your power, us to whom\nGod hath vouchsafed so great favour as to cause us to be born your\nrelations, even of your own kin, and your true nephews, children of\nyour only brother,--or, to speak more properly, assist your only\nbrother, who has fallen a martyr to the ambitious views of this\ntraitor. Most redoubted lord, there is no man so poor, who, having had\nhis brother murdered, will not prosecute the murderer to death, and\nthe more earnestly as the criminal displays greater obstinacy. This is\nexemplified in the conduct of our traitor; for it is notorious, that he\nhas dared to write, and to declare to many respectable persons, that he\nslew your brother, whom God pardon! our much-redoubted lord and father,\nfairly and meritoriously. In answer to which, I Charles of Orleans say,\nthat he lies, and I at present decline to make a more ample reply,--for\nit is very manifest, as I have before explained, that he is a liar, and\na false disloyal traitor, and that, through the grace of God, I am, and\never will be without reproach, and a teller of truth.\n\n\u2018Since, therefore, such things cannot fail of being very prejudicial to\nyour realm and to the public welfare, we beseech you most humbly to do\nus that justice which you are bounden to do, and to assist us by every\nmeans in your power, that we may have full and ample reparation for the\nwrongs done us and our family, and that this murder may be punished in\nthe manner it deserves. In acting thus, you will acquit yourself toward\nGod our Creator, and execute justice, of which you are the supreme\nhead, to whom we must have recourse after God.\n\n\u2018That you, our most redoubted lord, may be assured that the contents of\nthis letter are from our free will and knowledge, we, Charles, Philip\nand John, your most humble children and nephews, have each of us signed\nit with our own hands. Written at Gergeau, the 10th day of July, in the\nyear 1411.\u2019\n\nThis letter was sent, by a herald of the duke of Orleans, to the king\nat Paris, and was laid before the whole of the council, where different\nopinions were held as to the contents. Some wished that the brothers\nshould have their requests complied with, and that the duke of Burgundy\nshould be summoned, that they might hear what he had to say in his\ndefence to the charges which they should make against him. But at\nlength the business was postponed, and the duke of Orleans could not\nobtain any favourable answer; for the greater part of those who ruled\nthe king and the duke of Acquitaine were favourers of the duke of\nBurgundy, to whom they shortly after sent a copy of the above letter.\n\nThe duke of Burgundy, on reading it, was convinced that the family of\nOrleans and their friends would very soon declare war against him;\nand in consequence, he immediately began to make every preparation to\noppose them, by forming magazines of stores, and engaging a numerous\nbody of men at arms, in various parts of his possessions.\n\nThe duke of Orleans and his brothers had not only written to the king\nof France, and to the princes of the blood, but also to the principal\ntowns, making complaint against the duke of Burgundy, and requiring\ntheir support. When they perceived that the king and his ministers did\nnot intend to answer their letter, they again wrote to the great towns,\ngiving them to understand, that if redress were not granted them in the\nlegal manner, as they had demanded it, they should seek other means of\nobtaining it.\n\nIt was now ordered by the king, the queen, and the duke of Berry,\nand others of weight in the council, that measures should be adopted\nfor appeasing the quarrels of the dukes of Orleans and of Burgundy.\nAmbassadors were sent to each of the parties, but without success,\nprincipally because the duke of Burgundy would not condescend to make\nany other reparation than what had passed at the treaty of Chartres;\nand his pride was increased by having the king and the duke of\nAcquitaine on his side.\n\nThe Orleans-party were much discontented, but not dismayed; for many\nvery considerable lords were with them, and had promised them aid and\nsupport against the duke of Burgundy to the utmost of their powers. The\nqueen, therefore, and the others employed to negotiate a peace between\nthe two factions, finding their attempts fruitless, gave it up, and on\na certain day made a report to the king of what they had done, and the\nanswers they had received from both parties. Shortly after, the duke\nof Orleans and his faction resolved to make mortal war on the duke of\nBurgundy and his allies, and sent him their challenges by a herald.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XXVIII.\n\n    THE DUKE OF ORLEANS AND HIS BROTHERS SEND A CHALLENGE TO THE\n    DUKE OF BURGUNDY, IN HIS TOWN OF DOUAY.\n\n\nThe following is the tenour of the challenge sent by the three brothers\nof Orleans to the duke of Burgundy, in consequence of the murder of\ntheir late father, the duke of Orleans.\n\n\u2018Charles, duke of Orleans and of Valois, count of Blois and of\nBeaumont, and lord of Coucy, Philip count of Vertus, John count of\nAngoul\u00eame, brothers,--to thee, John, who callest thyself duke of\nBurgundy.\n\n\u2018For the very horrible murder by thee committed (in treacherously\nwaylaying by assassins) on the person of our most redoubted lord and\nfather, Louis duke of Orleans, only brother to my lord the king, our\nsovereign and thine, in spite of all the divers oaths of brotherhood\nand fellowship thou hadst sworn to him; and for the numberless\ntreacheries and disloyal acts that thou hast perpetrated, as well\nagainst our sovereign lord the king as against ourselves, we thus\nacquaint thee, that we shall make war upon and distress thee and thine\nby every possible means in our power.\n\n\u2018And we appeal to God and justice against thy disloyalty and treason,\nand call for the assistance of every worthy man in this world. In\ntestimony whereof, and to assure thee of its truth, we have subjoined\nthe seal of me Charles of Orleans to these presents. Given at Gergeau,\nthe 18th day of July.\u2019\n\nThe above letter was delivered to the duke of Burgundy by a herald\nin his town of Douay, who, having considered its contents, wrote the\nfollowing answer, which he sent by one of his heralds at arms to the\naforesaid brothers.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XXIX.\n\n    THE DUKE OF BURGUNDY SENDS AN ANSWER TO THE CHALLENGE OF THE\n    DUKE OF ORLEANS AND HIS BROTHERS.\n\n\n\u2018John duke of Burgundy, count of Artois, of Flanders, palatine of\nBurgundy, lord of Salines and of Malines,--to thee Charles, who stylest\nthyself duke of Orleans and Valois,--and to thee Philip, who signest\nthyself count of Vertus,--and to thee John, who callest thyself count\nof Angoul\u00eame, who have lately sent me your letters of defiance.\n\n\u2018We make known to you, and to all the world, that to put an end to the\nabominable treasons and mischiefs that were daily plotted in various\nways, against the person of our sovereign lord and king, and against\nall his royal offspring, by Louis your father, and to prevent your\nfalse and disloyal father from succeeding in his abominable designs\nagainst the person of our and his most redoubted lord and sovereign,\nwhich were become so notorious that no honest man ought to have\nsuffered him to live, more especially we who are cousin-german to\nour lord the king, dean of the peerage, and twice a peer[69], felt it\nincumbent on us not to permit such a person longer to exist on the\nearth, and, by putting an end to his life, have done pleasure to God,\nand a most loyal service to our sovereign lord, in destroying a vile\nand disloyal traitor.\n\n\u2018And since thou and thy brothers are following the detestable traces\nand felony of your said father, thinking to succeed in the aforesaid\ndamnable attempts, we have received your challenge with great gladness\nof heart. But in regard to the charges therein made against us, we\ndeclare ye have falsely and wickedly lied, like disloyal traitors as\nye are; and with the assistance of our sovereign, who is perfectly\nwell acquainted and satisfied with our loyalty and honour, and for the\nwelfare of his people, we will inflict that punishment on you as such\nabandoned traitors and wicked rebels are deserving of. In witness of\nwhich, we have had this letter sealed with our seal. Given at our town\nof Douay, the 14th day of August, in the year 1411.\u2019\n\nThis answer, as I have before said, was carried by one of the duke of\nBurgundy\u2019s officers at arms to Blois, and there delivered to the duke\nof Orleans and his brothers, who were very indignant at the expressions\ncontained therein. He nevertheless entertained the bearer well, and,\nhaving maturely considered the matter, exerted himself to the utmost in\ncollecting men at arms to wage war on the duke of Burgundy.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XXX.\n\n    THE DUKE OF BURGUNDY IS DISCONTENTED WITH SIR MANSART DU\n    BOS.--HE SENDS LETTERS TO REQUIRE THE ASSISTANCE OF THE DUKE OF\n    BOURBON.\n\n\nWhen the duke of Burgundy was convinced that he could not avoid war\nwith the family of Orleans and their adherents, for several of them had\nchallenged him by letters and otherwise, he vigorously applied himself\nto collect forces to resist them. Among those who had sent him letters\nof defiance, he was more displeased with sir Mansart du Bos, a knight\nof Picardy, than with any of the rest; but of him, and his end, more\nshall be said hereafter.\n\nHe wrote a letter to the duke of Bourbon, which he sent by Flanders\nking at arms, the contents of which were as follow:\n\n\u2018Very dear and well-beloved cousin, duke of Bourbon and count of\nClermont,--John duke of Burgundy, count of Artois, Flanders and\nBurgundy, hopes he remains well in your good memory. In the year 1405,\nyou and he formed certain alliances, which, three years ago, were,\nat your request, renewed and again sworn to, in the presence of many\nknights and of other persons well deserving credit. In consequence, you\nwere to remain my good and true friend during your life, to promote to\nthe utmost my welfare and honour, and to ward off any evil from me, as\na sincere relation is bound to do; and likewise, whenever any thing\nshould affect my own honour, or that of my friends, you were bound\nto assist them or me, to the utmost of your abilities, in council or\nin arms, and to aid me with money and vassals against all the world,\nexcepting only the persons of my lord the king and of my lord of\nAcquitaine, or whoever may succeed to the throne of France, and of my\nlate fair cousin, the duke of Bourbon, your father.\n\n\u2018Should it have happened that a war took place between me and any\nenemy, whose side the late duke of Bourbon embraced, in that case you\nmight have joined your late father, but only during the course of\nhis life, without any way derogating from the articles of our said\nalliance. Now, as we both have most solemnly sworn to the observance\nof this alliance on the holy evangelists of God, and on sacred relics\ntouched by us, to the damnation of our souls in case of failure, I\ninform you, very dear and well-beloved cousin, that Charles, who calls\nhimself duke of Orleans, in conjunction with Philip and John, his\nbrothers, have sent me a challenge, and intend to wage war on me to the\nutmost of their power; but I hope, through the will of God, and the\nassistance of my friends and allies, in council and in arms, and with\nthe aid of my subjects and vassals, to make a successful defence of my\nhonour against their attempts.\n\n\u2018And since, very dear and well-beloved cousin, you have so solemnly\nbound yourself to assist me on every lawful occasion, I now,\ntherefore, in virtue of this alliance, require and summon you to come\npersonally to my aid, attended by as many of your friends and men\nat arms as you can collect, in opposition to the aforesaid Charles,\nPhilip and John, and thus honourably acquit yourself of your oaths and\npromises,--knowing, at the same time, that on a similar occasion I\nwould accomplish every article of my oaths, without any fraud whatever.\nAnd this I hope you will do.--Have the goodness to write to me by the\nreturn of the bearer, to inform me of your pleasure and intentions, as\nthe necessity of the case requires it.\n\n\u2018Given at my town of Douay, and sealed with my great seal appendant to\nthese presents, the 14th day of August, in the year 1411.\u2019\n\nThis letter was delivered by the aforesaid herald to the duke of\nBourbon, who, having fully read and considered its contents, replied\nto the herald, that he would speedily send his answer to the duke of\nBurgundy. This he did; for in a few days he returned the articles of\nconfederation, which he had formed with the duke of Burgundy, declaring\nthem annulled, and strictly united himself to the duke of Orleans and\nhis brothers, to the great displeasure of the duke of Burgundy, but\nwho at that time could not redress it.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XXXI.\n\n    A ROYAL PROCLAMATION IS ISSUED, THAT NO PERSON WHATEVER BEAR\n    ARMS FOR EITHER OF THE PARTIES OF THE DUKES OF ORLEANS OR OF\n    BURGUNDY.--THE LATTER WRITES TO THE BAILIFF OF AMIENS.\n\n\nThe duke of Burgundy, fearful that many of his friends would desert\nhim, in obedience of the royal proclamation which had been made in\nevery town and bailiwick through France, strictly commanding all\npersons whatever not to interfere, or in any manner to assist the\ndukes of Orleans and Burgundy in their quarrels with each other, wrote\nletters to the bailiff of Amiens, to his lieutenant, and the mayor and\nsheriffs of that place, and to each of them, the contents of which were\nas follows:\n\n\u2018Very dear and well-beloved,--we have heard from several of the\ndeclaration of my lord the king, by which you are forbidden, as well\nas all his other subjects, to arm in our defence, or in that of our\nadversaries. This proclamation has been issued by our lord the king,\nbecause he was very desirous of establishing peace and concord between\nus and our enemies; and for this purpose he had many times sent his\nambassadors as well to them as to us, to which we have alway replied\nlike a true and loyal subject and servant; and, through God\u2019s mercy,\nall our answers have tended to a good end, and to peace and union,\nwhich has made them perfectly agreeable to our lord the king. But our\nadversaries having persisted in the same damnable and wicked purposes,\nwhich they have ever followed against the peace of my lord the king,\nhis noble family, and the public welfare, by continuing to tread in\nthe footsteps of their father, who, for a long time, persevered in\nhis intentions of destroying my lord the king and his family, have\nacted quite contrariwise, and sent answers full of dissimulation and\ntreachery, with the sole design of gaining time.\n\n\u2018Whilst our much-redoubted lady the queen of France, our very dear\nlord and uncle the duke of Berry, and our very dear brother the duke\nof Brittany, were endeavouring, according to the king\u2019s orders, to\nnegotiate a peace between us and our adversaries, these false and\ndisloyal traitors, and disobedient subjects, Charles, who calls himself\nduke of Orleans, and his brothers, sent to us their challenges, and,\nbefore that time, have often scandalously, and in violation of their\noaths, defamed our person and character as they had before done. This,\nhowever, under God\u2019s pleasure, will fail in having any effect, for he\nwho knows all hearts is acquainted with the steady love and attachment\nwe bear, and shall bear so long as we live, to our lord the king and\nto his family, and to the welfare of his kingdom; and we shall ever\nsupport the same with all the worldly possessions and powers that God\nhas bestowed upon us.\n\n\u2018With these views we have done and commanded such acts as have been\ndone, without paying regard to the scandalous defamations that have\nbeen thrown out against us, or any way fearing a diminution of honour\nby such false, wicked, and disobedient traitors to our lord the king,\nas the aforesaid Charles and his brothers, the issue of that infamous\ntraitor, their father, so notorious throughout the realm.\n\n\u2018In truth, we hold it not to have been the intention of our lord the\nking to prevent any of our relatives, friends, allies, subjects, and\nwell-inclined vassals, from joining us, in the defence of our honour,\nagainst our enemies, and to defend our countries from invasion.\n\n\u2018We therefore entreat of you, and require most affectionately, that\nyou will please to allow such as may be inclined to serve us, who live\nwithin your bailiwick, and all others of our friends who may travel\nthrough it, to pass freely without any molestation whatever; for you\nmay be assured, that what we shall do will be for the welfare and\nsecurity of my lord the king, his family, and the whole kingdom, to the\nconfusion of all disloyal traitors.\n\n\u2018Should there be any thing that we could do to give you pleasure,\nyou have but to signify it to us, and we will do it with our whole\nheart.--Very dear and good friends, may the Holy Spirit have you under\nhis care! Written in our town of Douay, the 13th day of August.\u2019\n\nThese letters were very agreeable to Ferry de Hangest, then bailiff of\nAmiens, and to the others to whom they had been addressed, for they\nwere well inclined to favour the duke of Burgundy.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XXXII.\n\n    THE PARISIANS TAKE UP ARMS AGAINST THE ARMAGNACS.--A CIVIL WAR\n    BREAKS OUT IN SEVERAL PARTS OF FRANCE.\n\n\nAt this time the king of France, who had for a considerable time\nenjoyed good health, relapsed into his former disorder; on which\naccount, and by reason of the discontents that prevailed throughout\nthe kingdom, (the seat of government had been transferred to Melon,)\nthe butchers of Paris, who have greater power and privileges than any\nother trade, suspecting that the government of the realm, through\nthe intrigues of the queen and the provost of merchants, named\nCharles Cudane, would be given to the dukes of Berry and Brittany, in\npreference to the duke of Acquitaine, the king\u2019s eldest son, waited\nupon the latter, and exhorted him, notwithstanding his youth, to assume\nthe government for the good of the king and kingdom, promising him\ntheir most loyal aid until death. The duke of Acquitaine inclined to\ntheir request, and granted them their wishes.\n\nThis done, they ordered it to be proclaimed by sound of trumpet in all\nthe squares of Paris, that the provost of merchants, and others in\nParis, who were numerous, and whom they suspected of being favourable\nto the dukes of Berry, Bourbon, and Brittany, and to their parties,\nmust quit the town before a fixed day, under pain of suffering death.\nIn consequence of this proclamation, twelve persons, men and women,\nwithout including the domestics of the above lords, left Paris; and\nshortly after, the duke of Brittany, hearing of these commotions, took\nleave of the queen at Melun and retired into his duchy.\n\nThe butchers, and those who lived near the market-places, with the\ngreater part of the Parisians, were strong partisans of the duke of\nBurgundy, and very desirous that only he, or those that were of his\nparty, should govern the kingdom; and, to say the truth, it was now\nbecome dangerous for the nobility, of whatever party they might be, to\ndwell in Paris, for the common people had great sway in its government.\n\nIn the mean time, the duke of Orleans and his allies were strengthening\nthemselves, by every means in their power, with men at arms. The duke\nof Bourbon and the count d\u2019Alen\u00e7on came in these days with a numerous\nbody before the town of Roye in the Vermandois, which belongs to the\nking of France, and entered it about mid-day, more through fraud than\nby force of arms, for the townsmen did not suspect any warfare. When\nthey had dined, they sent for the principal inhabitants, and ordered\nthem, whether it were pleasing to them or otherwise, to receive a\ngarrison from them. They then rode to Nesle, in the Vermandois,\nbelonging to the count de Dammartin, wherein they also placed a\ngarrison.\n\nThence they dispatched sir Clugnet de Brabant, who had joined them, sir\nManessier Guieret, and other captains well attended, to the town of\nHam in the Vermandois, belonging to the duke of Orleans: they returned\nby Chauni sur Oise, where they also left a garrison, and in many other\nplaces, as well belonging to themselves as to others attached to their\nparty.\n\nThe duke of Bourbon, on his arrival from this expedition at his town\nof Clermont, strengthened it, and all his other towns in that country,\nwith fortifications. When the garrisons had been properly posted,\nthe war suddenly broke out between the two parties of Armagnacs and\nBurgundians.\n\nThe duke of Burgundy had not been idle in fortifying his towns with\ngarrisons, and in collecting men at arms to resist his adversaries: he\nhimself was in Flanders making preparations to march an army to offer\nthem battle. The army of the Armagnacs had already made incursions into\nArtois, and had done much mischief to friend and foe, by carrying off\nprisoners and great plunder to the garrisons whence they had come. The\nBurgundians were not slow in making reprisals, and frequently invaded\nthe county of Clermont and other parts.\n\nWhen by chance the two parties met, the one shouted \u2018Orleans!\u2019 and\nthe other \u2018Burgundy!\u2019 and thus from this accursed war, carried on in\ndifferent parts, the country suffered great tribulation.\n\nThe duke of Burgundy, however, had the king on his side, and those also\nwho governed him: he resided in his h\u00f4tel of St Pol in Paris, and the\ngreater part of its inhabitants were likewise attached to the duke of\nBurgundy.\n\nAt that time, the governors of Paris were Waleran count de St Pol and\nJohn of Luxembourg[70], his nephew, who was very young, Enguerrand\nde Bournouville, and other captains. They frequently made sallies,\nwell accompanied by men at arms, on the Armagnacs, who at times even\nadvanced to the gates of Paris. They were particularly careful in\nguarding the person of the king, to prevent him from being seduced by\nthe Orleans-party, and carried out of the town.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XXXIII.\n\n    SIR CLUGNET DE BRABANT IS NEAR TAKING RETHEL.--HE OVERRUNS THE\n    COUNTRY OF BURGUNDY.--OTHER TRIBULATIONS ARE NOTICED.\n\n\nSir Clugnet de Brabant, who always styled himself admiral of France,\none day assembled two thousand combatants, or thereabout, whom he\nmarched as speedily as he could from their different garrisons, to the\ncountry of the Rethelois, having with them scaling ladders and other\nwarlike machines. They arrived at the ditches of the town of Rethel\nabout sun-rise, and instantly made a very sharp assault, thinking to\nsurprise the garrison and plunder the town. The inhabitants, however,\nhad received timely notice of their intentions, and had prepared\nthemselves for resistance as speedily as they could.--Nevertheless,\nthe assault lasted a considerable time with much vigour on both sides,\ninsomuch that many were killed and wounded of each party.\n\nAmong the latter was sir Clugnet de Brabant, who, judging from the\ndefence which was made, that he could not gain the place, ordered\nthe retreat to be sounded; and his men marched into the plain,\ncarrying with them the dead and wounded. He then divided them into two\ncompanies; the one of which marched through the country of the Laonnois\nto Coucy and Chauni, plundering what they could lay hands on, and\nmaking all prisoners whom they met on their retreat.\n\nThe other company marched through part of the empire, by the county of\nGuise, passing through the Cambresis, and driving before them, like\nthe others, all they could find, especially great numbers of cattle,\nand thus returned to the town of Ham sur Somme and to their different\ngarrisons.\n\nWhen they had reposed themselves for eight days, they again took the\nfield with six thousand combatants, and marched for the county of\nArtois. They came before the town of Bapaume, belonging to the duke of\nBurgundy, and, on their arrival, won the barriers, and advanced to the\ngates, where there was a severe skirmish. But the lord de Heilly, sir\nHugh de Busse, the lord d\u2019Ancuelles and other valiant men at arms, who\nhad been stationed there by the duke of Burgundy, made a sally, and\ndrove them beyond the barriers,--when many gallant deeds were done,\nand several killed and wounded on both sides; but the Burgundians were\nforced to retire within the town, for their enemies were too numerous\nfor them to attempt any effectual resistance. The Orleans-party now\nretreated, and collected much plunder in the adjacent country, which\nthey carried with them to their town of Ham.\n\nDuring this time, sir James de Chastillon[71], and the other\nambassadors from the king of France, negotiated a truce at Leulinghen,\nin the Boulonois, with the english ambassadors, to last for one year on\nsea and land.\n\nWhile these things were passing, the duke of Berry came with the queen\nof France from Melun to Corbeil, and thence sent Louis of Bavaria to\nthe duke of Acquitaine in Paris, and to those who governed the king,\nand also to the butchers, to request that they would be pleased to\nallow him to attend the queen to Paris, and to reside in his h\u00f4tel of\nNeele, near to the king his nephew, since he was determined no way to\ninterfere in the war between the dukes of Orleans and Burgundy.\n\nBut his request was refused, chiefly owing to the butchers of Paris,\nand others of the commonalty, who had great weight; and that he might\ngive over all thoughts of coming, they broke every door and window of\nhis h\u00f4tel de Neele, and committed other great damages. They sent back\nthe queen\u2019s brother with a message to her, to come and reside with her\nlord at Paris, without delay, but not to bring the duke of Berry with\nher.\n\nThe Parisians, fearful that the king and the duke of Acquitaine might\nbe carried off from the h\u00f4tel of St Pol, made them reside at the\nLouvre, where they kept constant guard day and night, to prevent any\nattempts of the Orleans-party to carry them away.\n\nThe queen, on receiving the message by her brother from the Parisians,\nand suspecting the consequences of their commotions, set out from\nCorbeil, and returned to Melun with him and the duke of Berry. A few\ndays after, the Parisians took up arms, marched in a large body to\nCorbeil, took the town, and placed a garrison therein. They then broke\ndown all the bridges over the Seine, between Charenton and Melun, that\nthe Armagnacs might not pass the river and enter the island of France.\n\nWhile the queen and the duke of Berry were at Melun, with the count\nWaleran de St Pol, whom the marshal Boucicaut had sent thither, the\nmaster of the cross-bows and the grand master of the household came to\nthem with few attendants. The duke of Bourbon and the count d\u2019Alen\u00e7on,\non their road from the Vermandois and Beauvoisis, to join the duke of\nOrleans, who was assembling his troops in the G\u00e2tinois, called on the\nqueen and the duke of Berry, to require their aid and support against\nthe duke of Burgundy, which was not granted,--because the king in\nfull council, presided by the duke of Acquitaine, had just published\nan edict in very strong terms, and had caused it to be sent to all the\nbailiwicks and seneschalships of the kingdom, ordering all nobles, and\nothers that were accustomed to bear arms, to make themselves ready to\nserve the king, in company with John duke of Burgundy, and to aid him\nin driving out of his realm all traitorous and disobedient subjects,\ncommanding them to obey the duke of Burgundy the same as himself,\nand ordering all towns and passes to be opened to him, and to supply\nhim with every necessary provision and store, the same as if he were\nthere in person. On this proclamation being issued, very many made\npreparations to serve under the duke of Burgundy with all diligence.\nIn addition, the duke of Acquitaine wrote the duke letters in his own\nhand, by which he ordered all the men at arms dependant on the crown to\nserve personally against his cousin-german, the duke of Orleans, and\nhis allies, who, as he said, were wasting the kingdom in many different\nparts, desiring him to advance as speedily as he could toward Senlis\nand the island of France.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XXXIV.\n\n    THE DUKE OF BURGUNDY ASSEMBLES A LARGE ARMY TO LAY SIEGE TO THE\n    TOWN OF HAM, AND LEADS THITHER HIS FLEMINGS.\n\n\nThe duke of Burgundy, being now assured that the duke of Orleans and\nhis allies were raising a large force to invade his countries, and that\nthey had already placed garrisons in towns and fortresses belonging\nto him or his allies, whence they had made frequent inroads to the\ndespoiling of his country, was highly discontented. To oppose them, he\nhad sent his summons to all his territories in Burgundy, Artois and\nFlanders, and elsewhere, for all nobles, and others accustomed to bear\narms in his behalf, to prepare themselves to join him with all speed,\nwell accoutred and armed, in obedience to the king\u2019s commands, and to\noppose his and the king\u2019s enemies.\n\nHe also solicited the assistance of his good towns in Flanders, and\nrequested that they would powerfully exert themselves in his favour,\nto which they readily and liberally assented. They raised a body of\nforty or fifty thousand combatants, well armed and provided with\nstaves according to the custom of the country. They had twelve thousand\ncarriages, as well carts as cars, to convey their armour, baggage and\nartillery, and a number of very large cross-bows, called ribaudequins,\nplaced on two wheels, each having a horse to draw it. They had also\nmachines for the attack of towns, behind which were long iron spits, to\nbe used toward the close of a battle,--and on each of them was mounted\none or two pieces of artillery.\n\nThe duke of Burgundy had also summoned to his assistance the duke of\nBrabant, his brother, who attended him with a handsome company; as\ndid likewise a valiant english knight, named sir William Baldock,\nlieutenant of Calais, with about three hundred english combatants.\n\nTheir places of rendezvous were at the towns of Douay and Arras, and\nthe adjacent country. The duke of Burgundy, on quitting Douay with his\nbrother of Brabant and great multitudes of men of rank, advanced to\nSluys, belonging to the count de la Marche, where he lodged. On the\nmorrow, the first day of September, he marched away early, and fixed\nhis quarters on the plain near to Marcouin, where he had his tents\nand pavilions pitched, and waited there two days for the arrival of\nhis whole army, and particularly for his Flemings, who came in grand\nparade, and drew up to their quarters in handsome array.--So numerous\nwere their tents that their encampments looked like large towns; and\nin truth, when all were assembled, they amounted to sixty thousand\nfighting men, without including the varlets, and such like, who were\nnumberless,--and the whole country resounded with the noises they made.\n\nWith regard to the Flemings, they thought that no towns or fortresses\ncould withstand them; and the duke of Burgundy was obliged, on their\nsetting off, to abandon to them whatever they might conquer; and when\nthey went from one quarter to another, they were commonly all fully\narmed, and in companies, according to the different towns and the\ncustom of Flanders,--and even when they marched on foot, the greater\npart wore leg-armour.\n\nAs to their mode of marching through a country, whatever they could\nlay hands on was seized, and, if portable, thrown into their carts;\nand they were so proud, on account of their great numbers, that they\npaid not any attention to noble men, however high their rank; and when\nthe army was to be quartered, or when they were on a foraging party,\nthey rudely drove away other men at arms, especially if they were not\ntheir countrymen, taking from them whatever provision they might have\ncollected, or any thing else that pleased them. This conduct created\ngreat disturbances and quarrels, more especially among the Picards, who\nwould not patiently endure their rudeness, insomuch that the duke of\nBurgundy and his captains had great difficulty in keeping any kind of\npeace between them.\n\nThe duke, after waiting some days for the whole of his army, saw it\narrive; and then he marched off triumphantly, and in handsome array,\nand fixed his quarters on the river Scheldt, near to the town of\nMarcouin.\n\nOn the morrow, he advanced to Mouchi la Garhe, between Peronne and Ham,\nand halted there. At this place, a Fleming was hanged for stealing a\nchalice and other valuables from a church. He thence marched toward the\ntown of Ham sur Somme, where his enemies were.\n\nOn his approach to the town of Athies, belonging to the count de\nDammartin, one of his adversaries, the inhabitants were so terrified\nthat they came out in a body to present him with the keys of the gates,\non the condition of being secured from pillage. The duke liberally\ngranted their request, seeing they had thus humbled themselves before\nhim of their own free will, and gave them a sufficient force to guard\ntheir town from being any way molested.----The duke then advanced with\nhis army near to Ham, but sent forward some of his best light troops\nto observe the countenance of the enemy. The Orleans-party sallied\nout against them, and a sharp skirmish took place; but they were\ncompelled, by the superior number of the Burgundians, to retire within\nthe town. The next day he marched his whole army before the place in\nbattle-array, and had his tents pitched on an eminence in front of one\nof the gates, and about the distance of a cannon shot. The Flemings\nwere likewise encamped according to the orders of their marshals\nand leaders, during which the garrison made some sallies, but were\nrepulsed, in spite of their valour, by superior numbers, and many were\nkilled and wounded on each side.\n\nWhen the duke had surrounded this town on one side only, he ordered\nbattering machines to be placed against the gate and wall, to demolish\nthem; and the Flemings pointed their ribaudequins, and shot from them\nso continually, day and night, that the enemy were greatly annoyed.\nBreaches were made in the wall and gate within a few days; but though\nthe garrison was much harrassed, they repaired both in the best manner\nthey could, with wood and dung.\n\nAt length, the besiegers fixed on a day for a general attack on the\ngate, intending to force an entry: the engagement continued very sharp\nfor three hours, but the garrison defended themselves so valiantly,\nwounding and slaying so many of the assailants, that they were forced\nto retreat. This happened on a Thursday; and on the Friday, the duke\nof Burgundy, I know not for what reason, had it proclaimed that no\none should, on any account, make an assault on the town, but that all\nshould labour in forming bridges over the Somme, that a passage might\nbe obtained for the army, and that the place might be besieged on all\nsides,--but events turned out very far from his expectations.\n\nOn the Friday morning, the besieged were expecting that the attack\nwould be renewed; but hearing of the duke\u2019s intentions to cross the\nriver with his army and surround the town, they packed up all their\nvaluables and fled, leaving within the walls only poor people and\npeasants, who had retired thither for safety. Those persons not having\nability or inclination to defend themselves, the duke\u2019s army, headed\nby the Picards, entered the place without any danger. The Flemings,\nobserving this, rushed so impetuously to gain admittance that many\nwere squeezed to death. When they had entered, they instantly began to\nplunder all they could lay hands on, according to the liberty which\ntheir lord the duke had granted them; for, as I have said, he had been\nnecessitated so to do before they would march from home. Part placed\nthemselves on one side of the street, leading to the gate which they\nhad entered, and part on the other; and when the Picards, or others\nnot of their country, were returning, they stopped and robbed them of\nall they had: they spared no man, noble or otherwise; and in this riot\nseveral were killed and wounded.\n\nThey entered a monastery of the town, and took away all they could\nfind, and carried to their tents many of both sexes, and children;\nand, on the morrow, having seized all they had, they set fire to\nseveral parts of the town,--and, to conclude all, the churches and\nhouses, with many of the inhabitants, were burnt, as well as a great\nquantity of cattle that had been driven thither as to a place of\nsecurity.\n\nNotwithstanding this cruel conduct of the Flemings, six or seven of the\nmonks escaped from the monastery, by the assistance of some noblemen,\nparticularly the prior, who most reverently held in his hands a cross,\nand were conducted to the tents of the duke of Burgundy, where they\nwere in safety.\n\nSuch was the conduct of the Flemings at the commencement of this war.\nThere were many towns beyond the Somme that belonged to the duke of\nOrleans and his allies, who, hearing of what had passed at Ham, were,\nas it may be readily believed, in the utmost fear and alarm; and there\nwere few people desirous of waiting their coming, lest they should be\nbesieged in some fortress, and suffer a similar fate,--for sir Clugnet\nde Brabant and sir Manessier Guieret, as I have said, had already\nabandoned Ham, which was well supplied with stores and provision, and\nhad retreated to Chauni and to Coucy.\n\nThe inhabitants of the town of Neelle, belonging to the count de\nDammartin, seeing the smoke of Ham, were greatly perplexed, for their\ngarrison had fled; but they, following the example of the town of\nAthies, waited on the duke of Burgundy, and, with many lamentations,\npresented him with the keys of their town, offering to submit\nthemselves to his mercy. The duke received them into favour, in the\nname of the king and his own, on their swearing not to admit any\ngarrison, and to be in future true and loyal subjects to the king,\ntheir sovereign lord.\n\nThis oath they willingly took; and, having thanked the duke for his\nmercy, they returned to their town, and by his orders demolished some\nof their gates and many parts of their walls. They also made their\nmagistrates and principal inhabitants swear to the observance of the\ntreaty which they had made, and for this time they remained in peace.\n\nIn like manner, those of the town of Roye, that were but lately become\nsubjects to the king, sent deputies to the duke, at his camp before\nHam, to say, that the Orleans party had treacherously entered their\ntown, and had done them much mischief, but that they had departed on\nhearing of his march, and requesting he would not be displeased with\nthem, as they were ready to receive him, and act according to his\npleasure. The duke told them, he should be satisfied if they would\npromise, on their oaths, never to admit again within their walls any of\nhis adversaries of the Orleans-party. Having obtained this answer, they\nreturned joyous to their town.\n\nThe duke now passed the Somme with his army at Ham, leaving that town\ncompletely ruined, and marched toward Chauni on the Oise, belonging to\nthe duke of Orleans; but the garrison, hearing of it, quitted the place\nin haste. The townsmen, greatly alarmed, sent, without delay, to offer\nhim their keys, and humbly supplicated his mercy, saying that their\nlord\u2019s men at arms had fled on hearing of his approach, from the fear\nthey had of him. The duke received them kindly, and took their oaths,\nthat they would henceforth loyally obey the king their sovereign lord,\nand himself, and would admit a garrison of his men to defend the town.\n\nAfter the conclusion of this treaty, the duke advanced to Roye, in the\nVermandois, and was lodged in the town, having quartered his army\nin the country round it. He dispatched thence sir Peter des Essars,\nknight, and his confidential adviser, to the king of France, to his\nson-in-law the duke of Acquitaine, and to the citizens of Paris, to\nmake them acquainted with the strength of his army, and with his\nsuccesses. Sir Peter des Essars was honourably received by the duke\nof Acquitaine and the Parisians; and in compliment to the duke of\nBurgundy, he was reinstated in his office of provost, in the room of\nsir Brunelet de Sainct Cler, who, by the royal authority, was appointed\nbailiff of Senlis, on the dismission of sir Gastelius du Bost, who was\nsuspected of being a favourer of the Orleans-party.\n\nWhen sir Peter des Essars had finished the business he had been sent\non to Paris, he set out for Rethel to announce to the count de Nevers,\nwho had assembled a considerable force, the march of the duke, and to\ndesire him to advance to the town of Mondidier, where he would have\nmore certain intelligence of his brother. The count de Nevers, on\nhearing this, used all diligence to assemble his men, and set off to\njoin the duke.\n\nDuring these transactions, the duke of Orleans, the count d\u2019Armagnac,\nthe constable of France, the master of the cross-bows, with a large\nbody of men at arms and others, came to the town of Melun, where the\nqueen of France and the duke of Berry resided. Having held a conference\nwith the queen and duke, they advanced to La Fert\u00e8 on the Marne, which\nbelonged to sir Robert de Bar[72], in right of his wife the viscountess\nde Meaux. They crossed the Marne, and came to Arsy en Mussien, in the\ncounty of Valois, dependant on the duke of Orleans, where his brother,\nthe count de Vertus, met him.\n\nThe count was accompanied by a numerous body of combatants, among whom\nwere the duke of Bourbon, John son to the duke of Bar, sir William de\nCoucy, Am\u00e9 de Sallebruche, sir Hugh de Hufalize, with others from the\nArdennes, Lorraine and Germany, who, in the whole, amounted to full six\nthousand knights and esquires, not including armed infantry and bowmen;\nand this party was henceforward popularly called _Armagnacs_, as I have\nbefore observed. Each bore on his armour badges similar to those which\nthey had formerly worn when they lay before Paris.\n\nThe duke of Orleans marched this army from the Valois, passing by\nSenlis, toward his county of Beaumont; but Enguerrand de Bournouville,\nwho had been posted in Senlis with a large force of men at arms to\nguard it, sallied out on their rear, and made a good booty of their\nbaggage as well as prisoners. In doing this, however, he lost some of\nhis men, who were slain or taken, and he then returned to Senlis. The\nduke of Orleans, with the other princes, were lodged in the castle of\nBeaumont, and his army in the country surrounding it.\n\nThe count de Nevers was prevented from joining his brothers as he\nintended,--for the Armagnacs, being the strongest, constrained him to\nconduct his army to Paris.\n\nThe duke of Burgundy was already arrived at Mondidier with his whole\narmy, and was making preparations to combat his enemies, should they\nbe so inclined, or to attack any town to which they should retire,\naccording to his pleasure. But the Flemings were now desirous to return\nhome, and had demanded permission of the duke, saying, that they had\nserved the time required of them on their departure from Flanders.\n\nThe duke was much surprised and displeased at their conduct, but\nearnestly desired that they would stay with him for only eight days\nlonger, as he had received intelligence that his enemies were near at\nhand, with a great army, ready to offer him battle, and that they could\nnever serve him more effectually. At this moment, the greater part of\ntheir officers waited on the duke to take leave of him, who, hearing\nthe earnest and affectionate manner in which he made so trifling a\nrequest, resolved to go back to their men and inform them of it, and\npromised to do every thing in their power in order that it should be\ncomplied with.\n\nOn their return to the tent of Ghent, where all their councils were\nheld, they assembled the leaders of the commonalty, and told them the\nrequest the duke their lord had made, namely, that they would stay with\nhim only eight days more, for that his adversaries were at hand with\na large army to offer him battle. This request having been stated,\nvarious were the opinions of the meeting: some were for staying, others\nnot, saying they had fulfilled the term required of them by their\nlord,--that winter was approaching, when, so numerous as they were,\nthey could not keep the field without great danger. Their opinions\nwere so discordant that no conclusion could be formed, to enable their\ncaptains to give any positive answer to the duke.\n\nThis council was held the 20th day of September, in the afternoon;\nand when it became dusk, these Flemings made very large fires in\ndifferent places, of the wood and timber of the houses which they\nhad pulled down and destroyed in Mondidier. They then began to load\ntheir baggage-waggons, and to arm themselves; and at midnight they all\nshouted from their quarters, in Flemish, _Vax, vax!_ which signifies,\n\u2018To arms, to arms!\u2019 and alarmed all the other parts of the army.\n\nThe duke of Burgundy was entirely ignorant of what they intended to do,\nand sent some flemish lords to know their intentions; but they would\nnot explain themselves to any one, and made answers contrary to the\nquestions asked. During this, the night passed away; and the moment day\nappeared, they harnessed their horses to the baggage-waggons, and set\nfire to all their lodgings, shouting, \u2018Gau, gau!\u2019 and departed, taking\nthe road to Flanders.\n\nThe attendants of the duke of Burgundy, hearing this cry and clamour,\nwent to inform him of it in his tent. Very much astonished thereat, he\ninstantly mounted his horse, and, accompanied by the duke of Brabant,\nrode after them. When he had overtaken them, with his head uncovered\nand his hands uplifted, he most humbly besought them to return,\nand stay with him four days only, calling them his most trusty and\nwell-beloved friends and companions, offering them great gifts, and\npromising to relieve the country of Flanders from taxes for ever, if\nthey would comply with his wishes.\n\nThe duke of Brabant also remonstrated with them on the advantages\noffered them by their lord, and, as he asked in return so very trifling\na favour, entreated them to pay due deference to his demand. But it was\nin vain: they turned a deaf ear to all that was said, and continued\ntheir march, only showing the written agreements they had made with\nthe duke, which were carried before them, and which they had fulfilled\non their part; but, as they were signed with his seal, he had not\nperformed his, in having them escorted beyond the river Somme to a\nplace of safety. Should he refuse to do this, they would send him his\nonly son, then at Ghent, cut into thousands of pieces.\n\nThe duke of Burgundy, noticing their rude manners, and perceiving that\nnothing was to be gained from them by fair means, began to appease them\nby ordering the trumpets to sound for decamping. This was not done\nwithout much loss,--for the duke, occupied solely with the attempt to\nmake the Flemings change their minds, had not ordered the tents to be\nstruck, nor the baggage loaded, so that the greater part of the tents\nwere burnt, with other things, from the fire of the houses caused\nby the Flemings on their departure. The flames spread from house to\nhouse, to the lodgings of the duke of Burgundy, who was troubled to the\nheart,--for he well knew that his adversaries were in high spirits, a\nshort day\u2019s march off, and he was anxious to give them battle; but from\nthis conduct of the Flemings his intentions would be frustrated,--and\nwhat was worse, he knew for certain, that the moment they should hear\nof it, they would publish that he had retreated, not daring to meet\nthem. He was, nevertheless, forced to submit to events which he could\nnot foresee nor prevent.\n\nThe Flemings had no sooner turned their faces homeward but they\nadvanced more in one day than in three before, and whatever they could\nlay hands on was pillaged and thrown into their baggage-carts: they\nhad, moreover, many quarrels with the Picards and English, and it often\nhappened that stragglers were wounded or put to death,--and when they\nwere superior in numbers, they failed not to retaliate.\n\nIt must be remembered, that this retreat took place in the month of\nSeptember, when the grapes in the vineyards were ripe; and they robbed\nevery vineyard they passed, devouring so many that numbers were found\ndead among the vines. On the other hand, they fed their horses and\ncattle so very abundantly on the immense pillage which they every where\nmade, that very many were bursten.\n\nThe duke of Burgundy, on his arrival at Peronne with his men at arms,\nwent personally to thank the Flemings, who were encamped on the river\nside, in the most humble manner for their services, and then had them\nescorted by his brother, the duke of Brabant, to Flanders, when every\nman returned to his home. The magistrates of the great towns were,\nhowever, very much displeased when they heard of their behaviour; but\nthey did not at the time notice it, for there were too many of them\nunder arms.\n\nThus did the Flemings retreat from Mondidier contrary to the will of\ntheir lord, the duke of Burgundy. On the same day, a knight of the\nparty of the duke of Orleans, called sir Peter de Quesnes, lord of\nGarois, at the head of full two hundred combatants, made an attack\non Mondidier, about four hours after they had marched away. He found\nthere many people, especially merchants, and inhabitants of the\nneighbourhood, whom he took prisoners: he slew many, and he and his men\nmade a very great booty.\n\nHe then returned to Clermont in Beauvoisis, whither the Armagnacs had\nmarched in pursuit of the count de Nevers. When they heard of this\nretreat of the duke of Burgundy and the Flemings, they held a council\nwhether or not they should follow them into their own country. It\nwas at length determined by the wisest to return toward Paris, and\nattempt to gain admittance by means of some connexions they had there,\nprincipally in order to have possession of the person of the king,\nwhich was their grand object.\n\nThey began their march, in consequence, towards Verberies, and crossed\nthe river Oise by a new bridge, which they erected, and thence advanced\nfor Paris. Those who had the guard of the king and the Parisians\nwere not well pleased to hear of their being so near, and made every\npreparation to oppose their entrance to Paris. The Armagnacs, finding\nit impossible to succeed, managed so well with the inhabitants of St\nDenis that they were there admitted; and the princes lodged in the\ntown, and the army in the adjacent fields and villages. From that\nsituation, they made a sharp war on the town of Paris, and on all those\nwho sided with the king and the duke of Burgundy.\n\nThey advanced daily from different parts to the very gates of\nParis,--when sallies were made against them, particularly by sir\nEnguerrand de Bournouville, who was one of the chiefs of the garrison\nunder the count Waleran de St Pol, the governor of the town. Severe\nskirmishes often took place, and many gallant deeds were done by the\nmen at arms of both sides.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XXXV.\n\n    THE DUKE OF BURGUNDY ASSEMBLES ANOTHER ARMY TO MARCH TO\n    PARIS.--EVENTS THAT HAPPENED DURING THAT TIME.\n\n\nWe will now return to the duke of Burgundy, who having, as I have said,\ndismissed his Flemings, under the escort of his brother the duke of\nBrabant, went from Peronne to Arras, where he met the earls of Pembroke\nand of Arundel, and sir William Baldock, who had accompanied him on his\nlate expedition. As these earls were lately come from England, he paid\nthem every respect, in compliment to the king of England who had sent\nthem. They had brought full twelve hundred combatants, as well horse as\nfoot, all men of courage.\n\nMuch intercourse took place at this time between the king of England\nand the duke of Burgundy, respecting a marriage between Henry prince of\nWales and one of the duke\u2019s daughters[73].--After he had magnificently\nfeasted these english captains in his town of Arras, and made them\nhandsome presents, he ordered them to march to Peronne, and hastily\nsummoned men at arms from all quarters to meet him personally at\nPeronne, where he had commanded the nobles of his estates to assemble.\n\nThe duke of Brabant did not meet him this time, being detained in the\ncounty of Luxembourg by affairs on behalf of his wife. The duke of\nBurgundy left Peronne with no more than six thousand combatants, and\nmarched to Roye,--thence, by Breteuil, to Beauvais, and from Beauvais,\nthrough Gisors, to Pontoise, where he halted for three weeks or\nthereabout. During this period, great numbers of men at arms came from\ndifferent countries to serve him.\n\nWhile these things were passing, it was ordered by the royal council,\nin the presence of the duke of Acquitaine, the count de Mortain,\nthe lord Gilles of Brittany, Waleran count de St Pol, governor of\nParis, the chancellor of France[74], the lord Charles de Savoisy,\nand other great nobles, that certain proclamations should be sent to\nall the bailiwicks and seneschalships of the kingdom, respecting the\nassembling of such large bodies of men at arms, daily done in defiance\nof the king\u2019s orders, by the duke of Orleans, his brothers, the duke\nof Bourbon, the counts d\u2019Alen\u00e7on and d\u2019Armagnac, and others of their\nparty, to the great mischief and tribulation of the kingdom at large,\nand highly displeasing to the king and disgraceful to his dignity.\n\nThis proclamation again prohibited any one from daring to join the\naforesaid nobles, or any of their party in arms, under pain of being\nreputed rebels and traitors to the king and his realm. It likewise\ncommanded all that had joined them to depart without delay, and return\npeaceably to their homes, without further living on or harrassing the\npeople, and ordered that no hindrance should be given to prevent this\nfrom being carried into effect. Such as should disobey these orders\nwould be most rigorously prosecuted without delay as rebels,--and from\nthat day forth no grace or favour would be shown them.\n\nThis proclamation was published in the usual places, and some few, but\nin no great number, privately quitted the party of the Armagnacs, and\nreturned to that of the king. Those that were disobedient, when taken\nby the royal officers, were in great danger of their lives. Several\nwere publicly executed; and among them a knight, called sir Binet\nd\u2019Espineuse, attached to the duke of Bourbon from being a native of\nthe county of Clermont, suffered at Paris. The cause of his death was\nhis having taken by force some flanders horses that were coming as a\npresent to the duke of Acquitaine from the duke of Burgundy. After he\nwas beheaded in the market-place, his body was suspended by the arms to\nthe gibbet at Montfaucon.\n\nThis punishment was inflicted by order of sir Peter des Essars, who, as\nhas been said, was lately re-established in his office of provost of\nParis, in the room of sir Brunelet de Sainct-Cler.\n\nThe duke of Orleans and his party were indignant at this execution, as\nwell as at the late royal proclamation; and the duke of Bourbon was\nparticularly angry at the disgraceful death of his knight.\n\nThus affairs went on from bad to worse. One day, the duke of Orleans\nfixed his quarters, with a large force, at the castle of St Ouen, which\nis a royal mansion, and thence made daily excursions to the gates of\nParis. He pressed the Parisians so hard that they were much straitened\nfor provisions; for they were not as yet accustomed to war, nor had\nthey provided any stores or assembled a force sufficient to repel the\nattacks of their adversaries.\n\nThe archbishop of Sens, brother to the late grand master Montagu, had\njoined the Armagnacs, but not in his pontifical robes; for instead\nof a mitre, he wore a helmet,--for a surplice, a coat of mail,--and\nfor a cope, a piece of steel,--for his croisier, a battle-axe. At this\nperiod, the duke of Orleans sent his heralds with letters to the king\nand the duke of Acquitaine, to inform them that the duke of Burgundy\nhad fled with his Flemings from Mondidier, not daring to wait his\nnearer approach. He took that opportunity of writing also to some\nof his friends in Paris, to know if through their means he could be\nadmitted into the town. It was lost labour, for those who governed for\nthe duke of Burgundy were too active and attentive in keeping the party\ntogether.\n\nBy some intrigues between those of the Orleans-party and one named\nColinet du Puiseur, who was governor for the king in the town of St\nCloud, this place was given up to them. The duke of Orleans instantly\nre-garrisoned it, and continually harrassed the Parisians; for now\nhe could at any time cross the Seine at the bridge of St Cloud, and\nattack both sides of Paris at once. Thus were the Parisians oppressed\non all sides by the Armagnacs,--on which account, another proclamation\nwas issued in the king\u2019s name throughout the realm, complaining of\nthe continued atrocious and rebellious acts, in spite of the positive\norders of the king to the contrary, committed by the duke of Orleans\nand his allies, to the great loss and destruction of his subjects\nand kingdom; that since such grievous complaints had been made on\nthe subject, and were continually made, he was resolved to have a\nstop put to such lawless proceedings. The king, therefore, with\nmature deliberation of council, now declares the aforesaid family of\nOrleans, and their allies, rebels, and traitors to himself and the\ncrown of France; and in order that henceforward no persons may dare\nto join them, he declares, all such to have forfeited their lives and\nestates, and by these presents gives power and authority to all his\nloyal subjects to arrest and imprison any of the aforesaid rebels, and\nto seize on their properties, moveable or immoveable, and to drive\nthem out of the kingdom, without let or hindrance from any of the\nking\u2019s officers. Given at Paris, the 3d day of October, 1411. Signed\nby the king, on the report from the great council specially called\nfor this purpose, at the h\u00f4tel de St Pol, when were present the duke\nof Acquitaine, the count de Mortain, the count de la Marche, Louis\nde Baviere, the lord Gilles of Brittany, the count de St Pol, the\nchancellor of France, with many other nobles of high rank.\n\nIn consequence of this proclamation, many of the captains and noblemen\nof the Armagnacs grew cold in their service, or delayed joining them\naccording to their former agreements; and fearing greater evils might\nbefal them by further incurring the indignation of the king, they\nwithdrew to the king\u2019s party, and excused themselves the best way they\ncould.\n\nWhile these affairs were going forward, the duke of Burgundy remained\nat Pontoise, as I have before said, and was there joined by numbers of\nmen at arms, as well vassals to the king as his own.\n\nDuring his stay at Pontoise, a man of a strong make entered his\napartment, with the intention to murder him, and had a knife hid in\nhis sleeve to accomplish his wicked purpose; but as he advanced to\nspeak with him, the duke, having no knowledge of his person, and always\nsuspicious of such attempts, placed a bench before him. Shortly after,\nsome of his attendants, perceiving his design, instantly arrested him,\nwhen, on confessing his intentions, he was beheaded in the town of\nPontoise.\n\nThe king, in order to strike more terror into the duke of Orleans\nand his allies, issued other proclamations throughout his kingdom.\nUnderneath is the tenour of the one which he sent to the bailiff of\nAmiens.\n\n\u2018Charles, by the grace of God, king of France, to the bailiff of\nAmiens, or to his lieutenant, sends health.\n\n\u2018It has lately come to our knowledge, by informations laid before\nour council, that John, our uncle of Berry, Charles our nephew, duke\nof Orleans, and his brothers, with John de Bourbon, John d\u2019Alen\u00e7on,\nCharles d\u2019Albreth, our cousin Bernard d\u2019Armagnac, in conjunction with\nothers, their aiders and abettors, moved by the wicked and damnable\ninstigations of their own minds, have for a long time plotted to depose\nand deprive us of our royal authority, and with their utmost power to\ndestroy our whole family, which God forbid! and to place another king\non the throne of France, which is most abominable to the hearing of\nevery heart in the breasts of our loyal subjects.\n\n\u2018We, therefore, by the mature deliberation of our council, do most\nsolemnly, in this public manner, divulge these abominable and\ntraitorous intentions of the aforesaid persons, and earnestly do call\nfor the assistance of all our loyal subjects, as well those bound to\nserve us by the tenure of their fiefs as the inhabitants of all our\ntowns, who have been accustomed to bear arms, to guard and defend our\nrights and lives against the traitors aforesaid, who have now too\nnearly approached our person, inasmuch as they have entered by force\nour town of St Denis, which contains not only many holy relics of the\nsaints but the sacred bodies of saints, our crown and royal standard,\nknown by the name of the Oriflamme, with several other precious and\nrare jewels.\n\n\u2018They have also gained forcible possession of the bridge of St Cloud,\nand have invaded our rights, (not to say any thing of our very dear\nand well-beloved cousin, the duke of Burgundy, to whom they have sent\nletters of defiance,) by setting fire to and despoiling our towns and\nvillages, robbing churches, ransoming or killing our people, forcing\nmarried women, and ravishing maidens, and committing every mischief\nwhich the bitterest enemy could do. We therefore do enjoin and command\nthee, under pain of incurring our heaviest displeasure, that thou\ninstantly cause this present ordinance to be proclaimed in the usual\nplaces in the town of Amiens, and in different parts within thy said\nbailiwick, so that no one may plead ignorance; and that thou do punish\ncorporally, and by confiscation of property, the aforesaid persons,\ntheir allies and confederates, whom thou mayest lay hands on, as guilty\nof the highest treason against our person and crown, that by so doing\nan example may be held forth to all others. We also command, under\nthe penalty aforesaid, all our vassals, and all those in general who\nare accustomed to carry arms, to repair to us as soon as possible. Be\ncareful to have the within ordinances strictly executed, so that we may\nnot have cause to be displeased with thee.\n\n\u2018Given at Paris, the 14th day of October, 1411, and in the 32d year of\nour reign.\u2019\n\nThis ordinance was signed by the king, on the report of his council,\nand thus dispatched to Amiens and other good towns, where it was\nproclaimed in the usual places, and with such effect on the vassals and\nloyal subjects of the king that they hastened in prodigious numbers to\nserve him.\n\nOn the other hand, very many of those who were of the Orleans-party\nwere arrested in divers parts of the realm,--some of whom were\nexecuted, and others confined in prison, or ransomed, as if they had\nbeen public enemies. It was pitiful to hear the many and grievous\ncomplaints which were made by the people of their sufferings, more\nespecially by those in the neighbourhood of Paris and in the isle of\nFrance.\n\nI must not forget, among other circumstances, to relate, that the\nParisians, to the amount of three thousand, as well those of the\ngarrison as others, sallied out of Paris, and went to the palace of\nWinchester (Bic\u00eatre), a very handsome mansion of the duke of Berry,\nwhere, from hatred to the duke, they destroyed and plundered the whole,\nleaving the walls only standing.--When they had done this, they went\nand destroyed another house, where the duke kept his horses, situated\non the river Seine, not far from the h\u00f4tel de Neelle.\n\nThe duke was much enraged when he was told of the insult and mischief\nthat had been done to him, and said aloud, that a time would come when\nthese Parisians should pay dearly for it.\n\nAffairs daily grew worse; and at length, the duke of Berry, the duke of\nOrleans and his brothers, the duke of Bourbon, the counts d\u2019Alen\u00e7on and\nd\u2019Armagnac, the lord d\u2019Albreth, were personally banished the realm by\nthe king, with all their adherents, of whatever rank they might be, by\nsound of trumpet in all the squares of Paris, and forbidden to remain\nor set foot within it until they should be recalled.\n\nThey were not only banished the kingdom of France, but, by virtue of\na bull of pope Urban V. of happy memory, (preserved in the Tr\u00e9sor des\nChartres of the king\u2019s privileges in the holy chapel at Paris), they\nwere publicly excommunicated and anathematised in all the churches of\nthe city of Paris, by bell, book, and candle. Many of their party were\nmuch troubled at these sentences, but, nevertheless, continued the same\nconduct, and made a more bitter war than before.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XXXVI.\n\n    THE DUKE OF BURGUNDY MARCHES A LARGE ARMY FROM PONTOISE TO\n    PARIS, THROUGH MELUN.--THE SITUATION AND CONDUCT OF THE DUKE OF\n    ORLEANS.\n\n\nI have mentioned, that during the stay of the duke of Burgundy at\nPontoise, he received great reinforcements of men at arms from all\nparts: among others, the count de Penthievre, his son-in-law, joined\nhim with a noble company. Having remained there for about fifteen days,\nand made diligent inquiry into the state of his adversaries, on the 22d\nday of October, he marched his whole army thence about two o\u2019clock in\nthe afternoon. As the royal road from that place to Paris was occupied\nby the enemy, he quitted it for that through Melun sur Seine, where\nhe crossed the river with full fifteen thousand horse, and, marching\nall night, arrived on the morrow morning at the gate of St Jacques at\nParis. Great multitudes went out of the town to meet him; among whom\nwere the butchers of Paris, well armed and arrayed, conducted by the\nprovosts of the Ch\u00e2telet and of the merchants, under the command of the\ncount de Nevers, brother to the duke of Burgundy, who was attended by\nseveral princes, noble lords and captains: even the great council of\nstate went out upwards of a league to meet him, and to do him honour.\nIndeed, they all showed him as much deference and respect as they could\nhave done to the king of France, on his return from a long journey.\n\nWith regard to the people of Paris, they made great rejoicings on his\narrival, and sang carols in all the streets through which he passed;\nand because his entry was made late in the day, and it was dusk, the\nstreets were illuminated with great quantities of torches, bonfires and\nlanthorns.\n\nOn his approach to the Louvre, the duke of Acquitaine, who had married\nhis daughter, advanced to meet him, and received him with joy and\nrespect. He led him into the Louvre, and presented him to the king and\nqueen, who received him most graciously.\n\nHaving paid his due respects, he withdrew, and went to lodge at\nthe h\u00f4tel de Bourbon. The earl of Arundel was quartered, with his\nattendants, at the priory of St Martin des Champs, and his Englishmen\nnear to him in the adjoining houses. The rest quartered themselves as\nwell as they could in the city.\n\nOn the morrow, which was a Sunday, Enguerrand de Bournouville, with\nmany valiant men at arms and archers, as well Picards as English, made\na sally as far as La Chapelle, which the Armagnacs had fortified, and\nquartered themselves within it. On seeing their adversaries advancing,\nthey mounted their horses, and a sharp skirmish ensued, in which\nmany were unhorsed. Among those who behaved well, sir Enguerrand was\npre-eminent. Near his side was John of Luxembourg, nephew to the count\nde St Pol, but very young. Many were wounded, but few killed. The\nEnglish, with their bows and arrows, were very active in this affair.\n\nWhile this action was fought, the Armagnacs quartered at St Denis,\nMontmartre, and other villages, hearing the bustle, mounted their\nhorses, and hastened to cut off the retreat of Enguerrand. He was\ninformed of this in time, and, collecting his men, retreated toward\nParis; but as the enemy were superior in numbers, they pressed hard on\nhis rear, and killed and made prisoners several of his men.\n\nThe duke of Orleans and the princes of his party, on hearing of the\narrival of the duke of Burgundy with so large an army in Paris, ordered\ntheir men at arms, and others that were lodged in the villages round,\nto unite and quarter themselves at St Denis. To provide forage, sir\nClugnet de Brabant was sent with a body of men at arms into the Valois\nand Soissonois, where there was abundance. Sir Clugnet acquitted\nhimself well of his command, and brought a sufficient quantity to\nSt Denis; for at this time there was great plenty of corn and other\nprovision in France.\n\nThe Armagnacs were, therefore, well supplied; and as they were the\nstrongest on that side of Paris, they daily made excursions of\ndifferent parties as far as the rivers Marne and Oise, and throughout\nthe isle of France. In like manner, the army of the king and the duke\nof Burgundy scoured the country on the other side of the Seine, as far\nas Montlehery, Meulan and Corbeil; and thus was the noble kingdom of\nFrance torn to pieces.\n\nThere were frequent and severe rencounters between the men at arms of\neach side; and a continued skirmish was going forward between those in\nParis and in St Denis, when the honour of the day was alternately won.\n\nAmong other places where these skirmishes took place was a mill,\nsituated on an eminence, and of some strength. In this mill, two or\nthree hundred of the Orleans-party sometimes posted themselves, when\nthe Parisians and Burgundians made an attack on them, which lasted even\nuntil night forced them to retreat.--At other times, the Burgundians\nposted themselves in the mill, to wait for the assault of their\nadversaries.\n\nThe duke of Orleans had with him an english knight, called the lord de\nClifford, who had, some time before, joined him with one hundred men\nat arms and two hundred archers, from the country of the Bourdelois.\nHaving heard that the king of England had sent the earl of Arundel,\nwith several other lords, to the duke of Burgundy, he waited on the\nduke of Orleans to request that he would permit him to depart, for that\nhe was afraid his sovereign would be displeased with him should he\nremain any longer. The duke of Orleans having for a while considered\nhis request granted it, but on condition that neither he himself nor\nhis men should bear arms against him during the war. The knight made\nhim this promise, and then returned to England.\n\nOn the 6th day of November, Troullart de Moncaurel, governor and\nbailiff of Senlis, having marched about six score combatants of his\ngarrison to the country of Valois, was met by seven score of the\nArmagnacs, who vigorously attacked him; but, after many gallant deeds\nwere done, Troullart remained victorious. From sixty to eighty of the\nArmagnacs were taken or slain; and among the prisoners was sir William\nde Saveuse, who had followed the Orleans-party, when his two brothers,\nHector and Philip, were in arms with the duke of Burgundy. Thus, in\nthis abominable warfare, were brothers engaged against brothers, and\nsons against fathers. After this defeat, Troullart de Moncaurel and\nPeter Quieriet, who had accompanied him, returned with their booty\nto Senlis, when, shortly after, by the exertions of the old lord de\nSaveuse and the two brothers, Hector and Philip, sir William obtained\nhis liberty.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XXXVII.\n\n    THE DUKE OF BURGUNDY LEADS A GREAT FORCE, WITH THE PARISIANS,\n    TO ST CLOUD, AGAINST THE ARMAGNACS.\n\n\nThe duke of Burgundy having remained some time at Paris with his army,\nand having held many councils with the princes and captains who were\nthere, marched out of the town about midnight, on the 9th of November,\nby the gate of St Jacques. He was magnificently accompanied by men at\narms and Parisians, among whom were the counts de Nevers, de la Marche,\nde Vaudemont, de Penthievre, de St Pol, the earl of Arundel, Boucicaut\nmarshal of France, the lord de Vergy marshal of Burgundy, the lord de\nHeilly, lately appointed marshal of Acquitaine, the lord de St George,\nsir John de Croy, Enguerrand de Bournouville, the lord de Fosseux, sir\nRegnier Pot governor of Dauphiny, the seneschal of Hainault sir John de\nGuistelle, the lord de Brimeu, the earl of Kent, an Englishman, with\nmany other nobles, as well from Burgundy as from Picardy and different\ncountries. They were estimated by good judges at six thousand\ncombatants, all accustomed to war, and four thousand infantry from the\ntown of Paris.\n\nWhen they had passed the suburbs, they advanced in good array, under\nthe direction of trusty guides, to within half a league of Saint Cloud,\nwhere the Armagnacs were quartered. It might be about eight o\u2019clock in\nthe morning when they came thither, and the weather was very cold and\nfrosty. Being thus arrived without the enemy knowing of it, the duke of\nBurgundy sent the marshal of Burgundy, sir Gaultier des Ruppes, sir Guy\nde la Trimouille, and le veau de Bar, with eight hundred men at arms,\nand four hundred archers, across the Seine, toward St Denis, to prevent\nthe enemy from there crossing the river by a new bridge which they had\nerected over it. These lords so well executed the above orders that\nthey broke down part of the bridge, and defended the passage.\n\nThe duke, in the mean time, ascended the hill of St Cloud in order of\nbattle, and at the spot where four roads met posted the seneschal of\nHainault, sir John de Guistelle, the lord de Brimeu, John Phillips and\nJohn Potter[75], english captains, at one of them, with about four\nhundred knights and esquires, and as many archers. At another road, he\nstationed the lords de Heilly and de Ront, Enguerrand de Bournouville,\nand Aym\u00e9 de Vitry, with as many men as the knights above-mentioned. The\nthird road was guarded by Neville earl of Kent[76], with some picard\ncaptains; and the Parisians and others, to a great amount, were ordered\nto Sevres, to defend that road.\n\nWhen these four divisions had arrived at their posts, they made\ntogether a general assault on the town of St Cloud, which the Armagnacs\nhad fortified with ditches and barriers to the utmost of their power.\nAt these barriers, a notable defence was made by those who had heard of\nthe arrival of the enemy, under the command of their captains, namely,\nsir James de Plachiel, governor of Angoul\u00eame, the lord de Cambour,\nWilliam Batillier, sir Mansart du Bos, the bastard Jacob, knight, and\nthree other knights from Gascony, who fought bravely for some time; but\nthe superiority of numbers, who attacked them vigorously on all sides,\nforced them to retreat from their outworks, when they were pursued,\nfighting, however, as they retreated, to the tower of the bridge and\nthe church, which had been fortified.\n\nThe whole of the burgundian force which had been ordered on this duty,\nexcepting the party who guarded the passage of the bridge, now bent all\ntheir efforts against the church. The attack was there renewed with\ngreater vigour than before, and, notwithstanding the gallant defence\nthat was made, the church was stormed, and many were slain in the\nchurch as well as at the barriers. Numbers also were drowned of the\ncrowd that was pressing to re-enter the tower of the bridge, by the\ndrawbridge breaking under their weight.\n\nIt was judged by those well acquainted with the loss of the Armagnacs,\nthat including the drowned, there were nine hundred killed and five\nhundred prisoners. Among these last were sir Mansart du Bos, the lord\nde Cambour, and William Batillier. In the town of St Cloud were found\nfrom twelve to sixteen hundred horses that had been gained by plunder,\nand a variety of other things.\n\nWhile this was passing, the duke of Burgundy was with the main army\ndrawn up in battle-array, on a plain above the town: he had with him\nthe greater part of the princes, and his spies were every where on the\nlook-out that the enemy might not surprise him by any unexpected attack.\n\nThe engagement at the tower of the bridge was still continued by the\nBurgundians, in the hope of taking it; but it was labour in vain, for\nthose within defended it manfully.\n\nSome of the garrison sallied out on the opposite side, and hastened\nto St Denis, to inform the duke of Orleans of the disaster that had\nbefallen them. He was sorely displeased thereat, and instantly mounted\nhis horse, accompanied by the duke of Bourbon, the counts d\u2019Alen\u00e7on\nand d\u2019Armagnac, the constable, the master of the cross-bows, the young\nBoucicaut, and about two thousand combatants, advanced toward St Cloud,\nand drew up in battle-array on the side of the river Seine, opposite to\nwhere the duke of Burgundy was posted, and made every preparation as\nif for an immediate combat. The duke of Burgundy and his men likewise\ndismounted, drew up in order of battle, and displayed his banner, which\nwas most rich and splendid. But notwithstanding the eager desire which\nthese princes showed for the combat, it was to no purpose,--for the\nriver was between them, so that no damage could accrue to either party,\nexcepting by some chance bolts from the cross-bows, who shot at random.\n\nWhen the Armagnacs had remained there for some time, seeing that\nnothing effectual could be done, they remounted their horses and\nreturned to St Denis, leaving, however, a reinforcement to defend the\ntower of St Cloud. On their departure, the duke of Burgundy held a\ncouncil, and it was determined to march the whole army back to Paris.\nThe duke lost this day, in slain, not more than from sixteen to twenty;\nbut there were many wounded, among whom were Enguerrand de Bournouville\nand Aym\u00e9 de Vitry, who had fought well, as did the lord of Heilly. In\nlike manner, the earl of Arundel and his men behaved gallantly; and it\nwas one of them who had made sir Mansart du Bos prisoner, but for a sum\nof money he resigned him to one of the king\u2019s officers.\n\nThe duke of Burgundy, on his return, was received by the Parisians with\ngreat acclamations; for they had heard of his brilliant success, and\nthey imagined that through his means they should shortly be delivered\nfrom their enemies, who oppressed them sorely. With regard to the king,\nthe duke of Acquitaine, and the members of the grand council, prelates\nas well as seculars, the reception which they gave him, the princes and\nthe captains of his army, is not to be described.\n\nThe duke of Orleans, learning that the duke of Burgundy had returned\nto Paris with his army, held a council with the heads of his party,\nwhen, having considered the severe loss they had suffered of the most\nexpert of their captains, and the great power and numbers of their\nopponents, whom they could not at this moment withstand with hopes of\nsuccess, they resolved to retire to their own countries, and collect a\nsufficient army to oppose any force the king and the duke of Burgundy\nshould bring against them. This was no sooner determined than executed;\nfor they instantly packed up their baggage, and, crossing the\nnewly-erected bridge over the Seine, which they had repaired, and the\nbridge of St Cloud, hastily marched all night toward Estampes, and then\ncontinued their route to Orleans, and to other towns and castles under\ntheir obedience.\n\nThus, therefore, the duke of Orleans, in seeking vengeance for the\ndeath of his father, gained only disgrace and great loss of men. Such\nof them as were slain in the field, at the battle of St Cloud, were\nthere inhumanly left without sepulture, as being excommunicated, a prey\nto dogs, birds, and wild beasts. Some lords of his party, such as sir\nClugnet de Brabant, sir Aym\u00e9 de Sarrebruche, the lord de Hufalize, and\nmany more, passed through the county of Valois to Champagne, and thence\nto their own homes.\n\nNews of this retreat was, very early on the morrow, carried to the\nduke of Burgundy and his captains at Paris. Some of them mounted their\nhorses, and went to St Denis, when all that the Armagnacs had left was\nseized on and pillaged: they even arrested and carried away, in the\nking\u2019s name, the abbot of St Denis, for having admitted his enemies\ninto that town. Many of the principal inhabitants were also fined,\nnotwithstanding the excuses they offered. Others of the duke\u2019s officers\nwent to the town of St Cloud, which they found abandoned.--Many pursued\nthe Armagnacs, but in vain; for they had marched all night, and were at\na considerable distance before the news of their decampment had reached\nParis.\n\nA few days after, the king, by the advice and entreaties of the duke\nof Burgundy, bought the greater part of the prisoners made at the late\nbattle, by paying their ransoms to those who had taken them. In the\nnumber was Colinet, thus surnamed by many, who had betrayed the bridge\nof St Cloud to the duke of Orleans; and on the 12th day of November, he\nand five of his accomplices were beheaded in the market-place at Paris:\nhis body was quartered, and the five others were hung up by the arms on\nthe gibbet at Montfaucon.\n\nOn the 13th of the same month, a sermon was preached in the\nchurch-square, before the porch of N\u00f4tre Dame in Paris, by a Friar\nMinor, in the presence of the duke of Burgundy, many princes, and a\ngreat concourse of people,--in which he said that the bulls given by\npope Urban V. had been of the utmost efficacy against the rebellious\nsubjects of the king, and publicly denounced the duke of Orleans and\nhis party as excommunicated. They were also thus denounced in many\nother succeeding sermons.\n\nThe ensuing day, the king heard mass in N\u00f4tre Dame, and returned to the\nLouvre to dinner, when he most graciously received the earl of Arundel,\nand caused him to be seated at his table next to the duke of Burgundy.\n\nMany councils were held at Paris respecting this war, and on the\nmeasures the king should now adopt. It was at length determined, that\non account of the winter, neither the king nor the princes should\nattempt any thing more until the ensuing summer, but only have some\nable captains with a sufficient force on the frontiers, to harrass\nand pursue the enemy, and keep him in check. In consequence, the lord\nBoucicaut marshal of France, the lord de Heilly marshal of Acquitaine,\nEnguerrand de Bournouville, Aym\u00e9 de Vitry, the lord de Miraumont and\nothers, were ordered on this service with a very considerable force.\nThey marched toward Estampes and Bonneval, and those parts, having with\nthem the lord de Ront.\n\nBonneval, on the first summons from the above captains, surrendered to\nthe king\u2019s obedience, and the greater part of them were lodged in the\ntown, and in an adjoining abbey of some strength. Those of Estampes\nrefused to surrender, for it was garrisoned by the duke of Berry, and\nbegan to make war on the troops of the king and the duke of Burgundy,\nby the instigation of the lord Louis de Bourbon, governor of Dourdan,\nwho resided there.\n\nAt this period, with the consent of the duke of Burgundy, sir John de\nCroy, eldest son to the lord de Croy, still detained prisoner by the\nduke of Orleans, marched from Paris, with eight hundred combatants, for\nthe castle of Monchas, in the county of Eu, in which were the duke of\nBourbon\u2019s children and his lady-duchess, namely, one son about three\nyears old, and a daughter by her first husband nine years old, with\ntheir nurses and other attendants. The son of sir Mansart du Bos, and\nthe lord de Foulleuses, knight, were also there. The castle and the\nwhole of its inhabitants were taken by sir John de Croy; and he carried\nthem, and all he found within it, to the castle of Renty, where he held\nthem prisoners, until his father, the lord de Croy, was released. When\nthis misfortune was told to the duke of Bourbon, he was much afflicted;\nbut the duchess took it so sensibly to heart that very soon after she\ndied of grief[77].\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XXXVIII.\n\n    THE KING OF FRANCE SENDS THE COUNT DE SAINT POL TO THE VALOIS,\n    AND TO COUCY, AND OTHER CAPTAINS TO DIFFERENT PARTS AGAINST THE\n    ARMAGNACS.\n\n\nConformable to the resolutions of the aforesaid council, count Waleran\nde St Pol was sent into the Valois, to reduce the whole of that country\nto the king\u2019s obedience, and then to march to Coucy with a large body\nof men at arms, archers, and cross-bows.\n\nSir Philip de Servolles, bailiff of Vitry en Pertois, was also ordered\ninto the country of Vertus, with a considerable force, to subdue the\nwhole of it. The vidame of Amiens was sent into the county of Clermont.\nFerry d\u2019Hangest, bailiff of Amiens, was ordered, for the above purpose,\ninto the counties of Boulogne, Eu, and Gamaches.\n\nThe inhabitants of Crespy, the principal town of the Valois, no sooner\nlearnt the intentions of the count de St Pol than they surrendered it\nto him, and received him handsomely. He thence advanced to the castle\nof Pierrefons, which was very strong, and well provided with all\nwarlike stores and provision. On coming before it, he held a parley\nwith the lord de Boquiaux the governor, who concluded a treaty with\nhim for its surrender, on condition that the count would pay him, in\nthe king\u2019s name, two thousand golden crowns for his expenses, and that\nthe garrison should carry away all they had with them. The lady of\nGaucourt, who was in the castle, retired to the castle of Coucy, where\nshe was honourably received by sir Robert d\u2019Esne, the governor.\n\nThe count de St Pol marched from Pierrefons to la Fert\u00e9-Milon, a very\nstrong castle, and to Villers-Cotter\u00eats, both belonging to the duke of\nOrleans; when not only these two but all the other places in Valois,\nhearing of the surrender of so strong a castle as Pierrefons without\nmaking any resistance, surrendered, and returned to their obedience to\nthe king. The Count placed good garrisons in each, and then marched\nfor Coucy, in the Soissonois, where, as I have before said, sir\nRobert d\u2019Esne was governor of the castle. He had with him Rigault des\nFontaines, and others attached to the party of the duke of Orleans.\nThe governor of the town of Coucy was sir Enguerrand des Fontaines,\nand within it were many noblemen, who, holding a council, resolved to\nsurrender the place, and to leave it with all their baggage.\n\nThe count quartered himself and his men at arms in the town and\nsuburbs, and then summoned sir Robert d\u2019Esne, in the king\u2019s name, to\nsurrender the castle. This sir Robert refused to do, saying, that the\nduke of Orleans had given him orders, when he appointed him governor,\nnever to surrender it without his consent or knowledge, and these\norders he had sworn to obey; that it was well provided with all kinds\nof stores, and plenty of provision, so that he did not fear its being\ntaken by force; and he hoped, that before he should be induced to\nyield it, means would be found to restore his lord and master to the\ngood graces of the king.----The count, on hearing this answer, ordered\nthe castle to be surrounded, and quartered his men as near to it as\npossible, keeping up at the same time a brisk cannonade. Among other\nexpedients, the count employed a body of miners, to undermine the gate\nof the lower court, called la Porte Maistre Odon, which was as handsome\nan edifice as could be seen for twenty leagues round; and he employed\ncompanies of miners to work at the other large towers, who were so\nsuccessful that, in a short time, the mines were ready to be set fire\nto.\n\nThe governor was again summoned to surrender, but again refused. Upon\nwhich, the count ordered his men under arms, to be prepared for the\nstorm should it be necessary; and when all was ready, fire was set to\nthe combustibles within the mines, so that when the supporters were\nburnt, the whole of the tower and gate fell flat down, but, fortunately\nfor the besieged, the inside wall remained entire, so that the\nbesiegers were not greatly benefited. Several were killed and wounded\non both sides by the fall of the towers: one of them at the corner was\nprevented from falling to the ground by the wall supporting it; and one\nof the men at arms remained on this inclined tower, where he had been\nposted to guard it, and was in great peril of his life, but was saved\nby the exertions of the garrison.\n\nAt length, when the count de St Pol had been before this castle of\nCoucy about three months, a treaty was entered into between him and sir\nRobert, that he would surrender the castle on condition that he and his\ngarrison should depart unmolested whither they pleased, with all they\ncould carry with them, and should receive, for their expenses, twelve\nhundred crowns, or thereabout. When this was concluded, the governor\nmarched off with about fifty combatants, the principal of whom were\nhis son, le Baudrain de Fur, knight, Rigault des Fontaines, before\nmentioned, and Gaucher de Baissu. The lady de Gaucourt departed also\nin their company. Sir Robert and the greater part of his men went and\nfixed their residence at Creve-coeur and in the castle of Cambresis.\n\nThe count de St Pol, on the surrender of the castle, appointed sir\nGerard de Herbannes governor, with a sufficient garrison. There were\nwith him on this expedition his nephew John of Luxembourg, the vidame\nof Amiens, the lord de Houcourt, and many other nobles and esquires\nfrom Picardy, especially such as were his vassals. Having finished\nthis business so successfully, he returned to the king at Paris, who,\nin consideration of his good qualities, and as a remuneration for his\nservices, nominated him constable of France. The sword of office was\ndelivered to him, and he took the usual oaths, in the room of the lord\nd\u2019Albreth, who had been dismissed therefrom, being judged unworthy to\nhold it any longer.\n\nIn like manner, the lord de Rambures was appointed master of the\ncross-bows of France, in the place of the lord de Hangest, who had been\ndismissed by the king. The lord de Longny, a native of Brittany, was\nmade marshal of France, on the resignation, and with the consent, of\nthe lord de Rieux[78], who was superannuated.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XXXIX.\n\n    SIR PHILIP DE SERVOLLES, BAILIFF OF VITRY, LAYS SIEGE TO THE\n    CASTLE OF MOYENNES.----OTHER PLACES ARE BY THE KING\u2019S OFFICERS\n    REDUCED TO HIS OBEDIENCE.\n\n\nIn regard to the county of Vertus, the moment sir Philip de Servolles\ncame before the town of that name, it surrendered to the king,--and in\nlike manner all the other places in that county, excepting the castle\nof Moyennes. In this castle were sir Clugnet de Brabant, his brother\nJohn of Brabant, sir Thomas de Lorsies, and many more, who would not on\nany account submit to the king.\n\nThe bailiff of Vitry consequently laid siege to it, and made every\npreparation to conquer it by force. It was, however, in vain; for the\ngarrison were well provided with provision, artillery and stores of all\nkinds, so that they little feared the besiegers, and very frequently\ncut off their detachments.\n\nThe siege lasted for upwards of three months; and at the end of this\ntime, sir Clugnet and sir Thomas de Lorsies, mounted on strong and\nactive coursers, followed by two pages, set out from the castle,--and,\ngalloping through the besieging army with their lances in their rests,\npassed safely, striking down all opposers, escaped to Luxembourg, and\nwent to sir Aym\u00e9 de Sarrebruche to seek for succour. But they did not\nreturn with any assistance; for a few days after, John of Brabant was\nmade prisoner in a sally from the castle, and, by order of the king and\ncouncil, beheaded in the town of Vitry. After this event, the remainder\nof the garrison surrendered themselves to the king\u2019s obedience, on\nstipulating with the bailiff that they were to have their lives and\nfortunes spared. He instantly new-garrisoned the castle.\n\nThus was that whole country reduced to the king\u2019s obedience; and that\nof Clermont followed the example, by surrendering to the vidame of\nAmiens without making any resistance. The garrisons in the different\ntowns and castles that had done great mischief to the surrounding\ncountry withdrew with all their baggage, under the protection of\npassports, to the Bourbonois, and were replaced by the king\u2019s troops.\n\nThe bailiff of Amiens was equally successful at Boulogne-sur-mer,\nwhich, with all the adjacent places, surrendered, excepting the castle\nof Boulogne,--the seneschal of which, by name sir Louis de Corail,\na native of Auvergne, would not yield it without the permission of\nhis lord, the duke of Berry, who had intrusted it to his guard. The\nbailiff, however, with his men, destroyed the drawbridge, and filled\nup the ditches, so that no one could enter or come out of the castle.\nA parley took place between the governor and bailiff, when the first\nwas allowed to send to his lord, the duke of Berry, to know if he would\nconsent that the castle should be given up to the king, and hold him\ndischarged for so doing.\n\nThe duke, in answer, bade him surrender the castle to the king\u2019s\nofficers, and come to him at Bourges, which was done. In like manner,\nall the places in the county of Eu, and in the territory of Gamaches,\nwere surrendered to the king; and the officers who had been placed in\nthem by their lords were dismissed, and others of the king\u2019s servants\nput in their room.\n\nDuring this time, very large sums of money were raised in Paris and\nelsewhere, to pay the english troops who had come to serve the duke\nof Burgundy by permission of the king of England. On receiving their\npayment, the earl of Arundel, with his men, returned to England by\nway of Calais; but the earl of Kent[79] and his troops remained in the\nservice of the duke of Burgundy.\n\nAt this moment, the Orleans-party were in great distress, and knew not\nwhere to save themselves; for the instant any of them were discovered,\nwhether secular or ecclesiastic, they were arrested and imprisoned, and\nsome executed,--others heavily fined. Two monks were arrested at this\ntime, namely, master Peter Fresnel, bishop of Noyon, who was taken by\nsir Anthony de Craon, and carried from Noyon to the castle of Crotoy;\nthe other, the abbot of Foresmoustier, was made prisoner by the lord\nde Dampierre, admiral of France. They were soon delivered on paying a\nlarge ransom, when each returned to his bishoprick and monastery.\n\nThe lord de Hangest, still calling himself grand master of the french\ncross-bows, being attached to the Orleans-party, had, after the retreat\nfrom St Denis, secretly retired to the castle of Soissons. Having a\ndesire to attempt regaining the king\u2019s favour, he sent a poursuivant\nto demand a safe conduct from Troullart de Moncaurel, bailiff and\ngovernor of Senlis, for him to come and reside in that town. The safe\nconduct was sent to him, and he came to Senlis; but, because there was\nno mention of his return in this permission, Troullart made him and\nfifteen other gentlemen prisoners in the king\u2019s name. Shortly after,\nthey were carried to the Ch\u00e2telet in Paris, to his great displeasure,\nbut he could not prevent it.\n\nThe count de Roussy also had retired, after the retreat from St Denis,\nto his castle of Pont \u00e1 Arsy sur Aine; but it was instantly surrounded\nby the peasants of the Laonnois, who increased to about fifteen\nhundred, and made most terrible assaults on the castle,--and, in spite\nof its deep moat and thick walls, they damaged it very much. These\npeasants called themselves the king\u2019s children. Sir Brun de Barins,\nknight, bailiff of the Vermandois, and the provost of Laon, came to\nassist and to command them,--when the count, perceiving the danger he\nwas in, to avoid falling into the hands of these peasants, surrendered\nhimself and his castle to the bailiff of the Vermandois, on condition\nthat his own life, and the lives of all within it, should be spared.\nThe bailiff accepted the terms, and, having re-garrisoned it with the\nking\u2019s troops, carried the count and his men prisoners to Laon, where\nthey remained a long time; but at length, on paying a heavy ransom,\nthey obtained their liberty.\n\nThe archdeacon of Brie was, in like manner, taken in the tower of\nAndely by these peasants. He was natural son to the king of Armenia.\nSir William de Coussy, who was of the Orleans-party, retired to his\nbrother in Lorraine, who was bishop of Metz.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XL.\n\n    THE DUKES OF ACQUITAINE AND BURGUNDY MARCH TO CONQUER ESTAMPES\n    AND DOURDAN.----THE EXECUTION OF SIR MANSART DU BOS AND OTHER\n    PRISONERS.\n\n\nDuring these tribulations, there were so many grievous complaints made\nto the king and the princes at Paris, of the mischiefs done to the\ncountry by the garrisons of Estampes and Dourdan, that notwithstanding\nit had been determined in council that neither the king nor the duke\nof Acquitaine should take the field until the winter should be passed,\nthis resolution was overruled by circumstances.\n\nOn the 23d day of November, the duke of Acquitaine, accompanied by the\nduke of Burgundy, the counts of Nevers, de la Marche, de Penthievre,\nde Vaudemont, and the marshal de Boucicaut, with others of rank, and a\ngreat multitude of the Parisians on foot, marched out of Paris, with\nthe intent to reduce to the king\u2019s obedience the garrisons of Estampes\nand Dourdan, and some others, who continued the war on the part of the\nduke of Orleans and his adherents.\n\nHe halted at Corbeil to wait for the whole of his forces,--and thence,\nwith an immense quantity of warlike stores and bombards, with other\nartillery, marched his army toward Estampes, wherein was sir Louis\nde Bourdon, who instantly withdrew into the castle. The townsmen\nimmediately returned to their former obedience, and were kindly\nreceived by the duke of Acquitaine, in consideration of his uncle the\nduke of Berry. Sir Louis de Bourdon, however, refused to surrender,\nalthough he was summoned many times, when the castle was besieged on\nall sides. The lord de Ront was at this time prisoner there,--for he\nhad been taken by sir Louis not long before the arrival of the duke of\nAcquitaine.\n\nMany engines were now pointed against the walls, which they damaged in\nseveral places; and in addition, miners were employed to underwork the\ntowers. The siege was carried on with such vigour that the garrison,\nthinking it probable they should be taken by storm, opened a parley,\nand, by means of the lord de Ront, surrendered themselves to the duke\nof Acquitaine. Sir Louis de Bourdon, with some other gentlemen, his\nconfederates, were sent to the Ch\u00e2telet at Paris. Great part of the\nwealth of Bourdon, with a most excellent courser of his, were given to\nthe lord de Ront, to make amends for the losses which he sustained when\nhe was made prisoner.\n\nThe dukes of Acquitaine and Burgundy re-garrisoned this place, and\nthen returned with their army to Paris; for in truth, they could not,\nfrom the severity of the winter, make any further progress. A few days\nafter, by order of the duke of Burgundy, many noble prisoners were\ncarried from Paris to the castle of Lille; among whom were the lord de\nHangest, sir Louis de Bourdon, the lords de Gerennes, des Fontaines,\nsir John d\u2019Amboise and others, who had been arrested for supporting the\nparty of the duke of Orleans. They suffered a long confinement, but\nwere set at liberty on paying a heavy fine.\n\nAt this period, sir Mansart du Bos was beheaded in the market-place\nof Paris, his body hung by the shoulders on the gibbet at Montfaucon,\nand his head affixed to the spike on the top of the market-house.\nThis execution took place at the instance of the duke of Burgundy,\nbecause sir Mansart was his liege man, nevertheless he had sent him his\nchallenge at the same time with the brothers of Orleans, as has been\nbefore noticed. Not all the solicitations of his friends could save\nhim, and he had many of weight with the duke, who endeavoured earnestly\nto obtain his pardon; but it was in vain, for the duke had resolved\nupon his death.\n\nThere were in the prisons of the Ch\u00e2telet, and in other prisons of\nParis, very many of the Orleans-party who perished miserably through\ncold, famine, and neglect. When dead, they were inhumanly dragged\nout of the town, and thrown into the ditches a prey to dogs, birds,\nand wild beasts. The reason of such cruel conduct was their having\nbeen several times denounced from the pulpits, and proclaimed from\nthe squares, as excommunicated persons. It seemed, however, to many\ndiscreet men, as well noble as of the church, that it was a great\nscandal thus to treat those who were Christians and acknowledged the\nlaws of JESUS CHRIST.\n\nThe same rigorous conduct being persevered in, a short time after,\na valiant knight, called sir Peter de Famechon, was beheaded in the\nmarket-place of Paris: he was of the household and family of the duke\nof Bourbon,--and his head was affixed to a lance like the others. The\nduke of Bourbon was much exasperated at his death, especially when he\nwas informed of the disgraceful circumstances that had attended it. At\nthis time, therefore, all who sided with the Armagnacs, and were taken,\nran great risk of their lives; for there were few that dared speak in\ntheir favour, however near their connexions might be.\n\n\nEND OF THE SECOND VOLUME.\n\n\n  AT THE HAFOD PRESS,\n  BY JA.

Q. Salines?\n\n[7] This battle was fought on the plains of Eichtfeld, near Tongres.\n\n[8] The lord d\u2019Agimont, son to the lord of Rochefort, and the lord de\nSaraing, according to Placentius.\n\n[9] There seems to have been some pretext, on the score of retaliation,\nfor the commission of these barbarities, the insurgents, during the\ntime of their power, having exercised many similar enormities against\nthose of the government faction.\n\n[10] John, third son of Louis I. and brother of Louis II. de Ch\u00e2lons,\ncounts of Auxerre.\n\n[11] Mentioned in p. 23.\n\n[12] Amblard I. lord of La Ba\u00fbme, had issue, Peter, Perceval, _John_,\nWilliam, and Louis. John was a monk at Ambronnai; but Perceval, who\ncontinued the line, had issue, Amblard II. and William, surnamed\nMorelet, who was grand butler of Burgundy in 1430. Perhaps he is the\n_great lord_ here meant.\n\n[13] Mentioned in vol. i. p. 135.\n\n[14] John III. lord of Crequy and Canaples, is mentioned by Froissart.\nHe had issue, John IV. lord of Crequy, &c. _Reginald_, killed at\nAgincourt, and others.\n\n[15] Escoquehen.

I do not find a queen of Portugal in the catalogue\nof her children; but this event seems to be here strangely misplaced.\nTurquet says, \u2018L\u2019an suyvant, 1418, d\u00e9c\u00e9da la royne D.

He married Philippa, daughter to king\nHenry of England by Eleanora his second wife.\n\n_Eric_ X. king of Denmark, &c. son of Wratislaus duke of Pomerania by\nMary of Mecklenburg, niece to Margaret, _the Semiramis of the north_.\nHis great aunt, Margaret, was still alive.\n\n[21] See before, vol. i. p. 57.\n\n[22] Margaret of Bavaria, sister to the emperor Robert, married Charles\nthe bold, duke of Lorraine.\n\n[23] Margaret, heiress of Vaudemont, married Frederick, brother of\nCharles duke of Lorraine.\n\n[24] Q. Who was this?\n\n[25] John le Maingre, second of the name, count of Beaufort and\nviscount of Turenne. He was the son of mareschal Boucicaut the elder,\nmentioned by Froissart, who died in 1371. He was himself made a\nmareschal of France in 1391, having been knighted, nine years before,\nat the battle of Rosebec in Flanders. He went into Hungary and was\npresent at the battle of Nicopolis, and made prisoner with John count\nof Nevers. He was again appointed to the relief of the emperor of\nConstantinople in 1399. In 1401, he was made governor of Genoa,--and\nhe took the city of Famagousta in Cyprus for the Genoese. He was made\nprisoner at Agincourt, and died in England 1421. He was a poet as well\nas warrior, and composed many rondeaux and virelays. In his epitaph, he\nis called Constable to the emperor of Constantinople.\n\n[26] See Shepherd\u2019s Life of Poggio, p. 42.\n\n[27] Robert Hallam, cardinal, and chancellor of the university of\nOxford.\n\n[28] Brandac.

See vol i. p. 63.\n\n[30] Ladislaus, or Lancelot, son of Charles of Durazzo, and brother to\nJoan II. who succeeded to the crown of Naples on his death in 1412.\n\nHe took up arms on behalf of Gregory, and invaded the florentine\nterritories in the year 1409, at the head of a large body of forces.\nThe proceedings of the council were in fact detrimental to him, as\nby its decree he was deposed, and the neapolitan crown vested in his\ncompetitor, the duke of Anjou. He had also seized many towns in the\npatrimony of St Peter, and among the rest on Rome itself.--See _Poggio_\n_Hist. Florent._ p. 178. et seq.\n\n[31] Flisque. Q. Fiesco?\n\n[32] Elizabeth, daughter of John duke of Luxembourg, brother of\nWenceslaus king of Bohemia, and _ci-devant_ emperor. See vol. i. p. 63.\n\n[33] John lord of Puisaye, fifth son to the duke of Bar.\n\n[34] Bona, third daughter of the duke of Bar, married to Waleran count\nof St Pol.\n\n[35] Charles de Montagu, to whom the confiscated honours of the vidame\ndu Laonnois and lord of Marcoussy were restored after the death of his\nfather. There was no issue of this marriage with Catherine d\u2019Albret.\n\n[36] Margaret de Clisson, widow of John de Blois and mother of Oliver,\ncounts of Penthievre.\n\n[37] John Maria and Philip Maria, sons of John Galeas, and successively\ndukes of Milan.\n\n[38] Theodore Pal\u00e6ologus, second marquis of Montferrat. He married,\nfirst, a daughter of the duke of Bar, and, secondly, a princess of\nthe house of Savoy. His daughter Sophia was married to Philip Maria\nVisconti, then count of Pavia, afterwards duke of Milan.\n\n[39] Facino Cane, a captain of great reputation, and partisan of John\nMaria Visconti, duke of Milan.\n\n[40] Gaing. Q. Gavi?\n\n[41] Noefville. Q. Novara, or Novi?\n\n[42] Q. Louis king of Sicily? or Charles king of Navarre? Probably the\nlatter.\n\n[43] John VI. count of Roucy and Braine, son of Hugh count de Roucy\nand Blanche of Coucy. He married Isabel de Montagu, and was killed at\nAgincourt.\n\n[44] The lords of Antoing and princes of Espinoy were a younger branch\nof the house of Melun, counts of Tancarville. John I. viscount of\nMelun, was grandfather both to the count of Tancarville and the lord\nd\u2019Antoing, mentioned in this volume.\n\n[45] Guichard Dauphin, descended from the old counts de Clermont,\ndauphins of Auvergne, grand master from 1409 to 1413. He was son to\nGuichard Dauphin I. grand master of the cross-bows.\n\n[46] Amadeus VIII. the first duke of Savoy, son of Amadeus VII. and\nBona daughter to the duke of Berry.\n\n[47] Bernard VII. brother of John III. count of Armagnac, killed at\nAlexandria della Paglia, as related by Froissart. This count was a\nman of the most unbounded ambition, and had already, in the forcible\nseizure of the county of Fesenzaguet, (the appanage of a younger branch\nof Armagnac) and the murder of its count, Geraud III. and his two sons,\ndiscovered an unprincipled cruelty of disposition, remarkable even at\nthis calamitous period of history. He married Bona of Berry, the widow\nof Amadeus VII. and mother of Amadeus VIII. above mentioned.\n\n[48] Martin king of Sicily, by whose death without issue the king of\nArragon was deprived of male heirs. The island of Sardinia was at this\ntime divided between the genoese and arragonian factions. The chief of\nthe former was Brancaleon d\u2019Oria, whose sister was married to William\ncount of Narbonne. Turquet calls him Aimery,--and says that the king\nof Sicily was not killed, but died a natural death at Cagliari, after\nobtaining a victory over the confederates.\n\n[49] Q. Angennes? John d\u2019Angennes, lord de la Louppe, was governor of\nDauphin\u00e8 and afterwards of the Louvre, and enjoyed great credit at\ncourt.\n\n[50] This Yvain Graindos is a strange corruption, if any corruption\nin the french nomenclature can be strange to a practised ear, of Owen\nGlendower, who, as Rapin says, \u2018upon the Welch unanimously renouncing\ntheir allegiance to the crown of England, and acknowledging him for\nsovereign, from thenceforward always styled himself Prince of Wales, as\nappears from several acts.\u2019\n\n[51] In a battle fought May 14. 1405. See Rapin\u2019s History of England\n_in loco_.\n\n[52] De Dolhaing. Q. D\u2019Olhaing?\n\n[53] I suppose Monstrelet must mean Jagellon, grand duke of Lithuania,\nwho was called to the throne of Poland in 1386, on condition that\nhe would become a Christian, marry the daughter of the late king,\nand annex Lithuania to Poland. This last condition, however, was not\ncompletely fulfilled until the reign of Sigismond Augustus in 1569.\n\n  _Baudran._\n\nJagellon took the name of Uladislaus V. on his baptism; but Hedwige,\ndaughter to the king of Poland, reigned two years before she married\nUladislaus.\n\n  _Anderson._\n\n\n[54] Sigismond was king of Hungary in 1387,--roman emperor 1411,--king\nof Bohemia 1419,--died 1437, aged 70. He married for his second wife\nBarbara, daughter to Hermannus II. count of Cilly in Crain.\n\n  _Anderson._\n\n\n[55] Of the half blood. See p. 138.\n\n[56] _I. e._ Bari.\n\n[57] Probably Nicholas d\u2019Este, connected by marriage with the house of\nMalatesta.\n\n[58] Probably Pandulph Malatesta, lord of Rimini, a captain of great\nreputation and adherent of king Ladislaus.\n\n[59] Sir Raoul de Gaucourt, successively promoted to the posts of\nchamberlain, governor of Dauphin\u00e8, and grand master of the household,\nbecame a distinguished actor in the wars with the English, from 1427 to\n1437 particularly.\n\nThere was also a sir Eustace de Gaucourt, lord of Vicy, who was grand\nfalconer in 1406 and 1412.\n\n[60] Count de Hembe. Q.\n\n[61] Charles de Mouroufle. Q.\n\n[62] The author of \u2018An Account of Livonia, with a Relation of the Rise,\nProgress and Decay of the Marian Teutonic Order,\u2019 London, 1701, relates\nthese transactions in the manner following:\n\n\u2018The order was now on the highest pinnacle of prosperity and honour,\nexceeding great kings and potentates of Europe in extent of dominions,\npower and riches, when Ulricus \u00e0 Jungingen was chosen great master; but\nhe being of a boisterous, fiery temper, soon broke the peace concluded\nbetween Poland with his brother Conradus \u00e0 Jungingen, whereupon\nking Uladislaus Jagellon joining forces with his father Witoldas of\nLithuania, formed an army of 150,000 fighting men and marched into\nPrussia. To stop the progress of this formidable army, the great master\ndrew up as many forces as he could, and, after the Livonians had\njoined him, found his army consisted, in a general muster, of 83,000\nwell armed stout combatants; and thus, with an undaunted spirit, he\nmarched forth to meet his enemy. Such a battle as this was never heard\nof before in these parts, and was given the 15th day of July 1410 in\nPrussia, near the town Gilgenbourg, between the two villages Tannenberg\nand Grunwald, on a large plain, with such obstinacy that, according\nto an exact computation, there were actually killed, on both sides,\n100,000 on the spot. The Poles got the victory, but lost 60,000 men.\nThe order lost 40,000,--but among them almost all their generals and\ncommanders. The great master himself, and the chief of the order, with\n600 noble german marian knights, were there slain. There is still\nkept every year a day of devotion upon that plain, in a chapel built\nto the remembrance of this battle, marked with the date of the year\nit happened, and this inscription, _Centum mille occisi_. The king of\nPoland was so weakened by this dear-bought victory that he very readily\nagreed to a peace. This memorable battle is called The Battle of\nTannenberg.\u2019\n\n[63] Moreri says, that the good duke Louis died at Monbucan on the 19th\nof August 1410. By his wife Anne, dauphiness of Auvergne and countess\nof Forez, he left John count of Clermont, his son and successor:\nhis other children, Louis and two daughters, died without issue and\nunmarried. He left also a natural son, named Hector, who was killed at\nthe siege of Soissons in 1414.\n\n[64] Boulogne, the property of the duke of Berry, by marriage with\nJane, heiress of Auvergne and Boulogne.\n\n    The county of Estampes belonged to the duke of Berry,\n    Valois, I believe, to the count d\u2019Alen\u00e7on,\n    Beaumont to the duke of Orleans,--and\n    Clermont to the duke of Bourbon.\n\n\n[65] Vinchestre, or rather Winchester,--now called Bic\u00eatre, was a\npalace built by a bishop of Winchester 1290. For further particulars,\nsee \u2018Sauval Antiquit\u00e8s de Paris\u2019, vol. ii. book vii.\n\n[66] I hardly know whether this can be the celebrated archbishop of\nRheims, and historian of the reign of Charles VI. who was one of the\nmost learned men of his time, and died at an advanced age, in 1474.\nHe had two brothers older than himself, William des Ursins, baron\nof Treynel, chancellor of France in 1445, and again in 1464,--and\nJames Juvenal des Ursins, who was archbishop of Rheims before him.\nThe history written by Juvenal des Ursins occupies the space from\n1380 to 1422, and throws great light, by comparison, on Froissart and\nMonstrelet.\n\n[67] Q. De Nesle?\n\nGuy III. de Nesle, lord of Offemont and Mello, was grand master of the\nhousehold to queen Isabella, and was killed at Agincourt. His two sons,\n_John_ III. and Guy IV. followed him in succession. He had a third son,\nwho died with him at Agincourt.\n\n[68] Monstrelet apparently mistakes. According to Moreri, _Robert_ duke\nof Bar died this year, leaving issue by his wife Mary (daughter to John\nking of France),\n\n    1. Henry lord d\u2019Ossy, who died in Hungary, 1396, leaving by his\n    wife Mary de Coucy, countess of Soissons, one son, Robert count\n    of Marle and Soissons, killed at Agincourt.\n\n    2. Philip, died in Hungary 1396.\n\n    3. Edward III. marquis du Pont, and duke of Bar after his\n    father\u2019s death.\n\n    4. Louis cardinal of Bar.\n\n    5. Charles lord of Nogent.\n\n    6. John lord of Puisaye. (Both Edward and John were killed at\n    Agincourt.)\n\n    7. Yoland, queen of Arragon.\n\n    8. Mary, countess of Namur.\n\n    9. Bona, countess of St Pol.\n\nOne striking peculiarity is discernible in this table, viz. the\npreference shown in the succession to Edward the third son, over\nRobert, son of the eldest son of the deceased duke; but this was\naccording to the law of many feudal tenures, which took no notice of\nour universally-established doctrine of _representation_ in descents.\nThe same law prevailed in Artois, and was the ground of that famous\ndecision by which Robert d\u2019Artois was ejected in the middle of the\nfourteenth century, and in consequence of which he retired in disgust\nto the court of our Edward III. who asserted the justice of his\npretensions.\n\n[69] He was a peer as duke of Burgundy, and again a peer as\ncount-palatine of Burgundy.\n\n[70] John, called count de Ligny, third son of John count of Brienne,\nbrother to the count de St Pol.\n\n[71] James de Ch\u00e2tillon was appointed admiral in 1408, in the room\nof Clugnet de Breban. He was lord of Dampierre, and son of Hugh de\nCh\u00e2tillon, formerly master of the cross-bows.\n\n[72] Nephew of duke Edward. See p. 232.\n\n[73] The advice which, according to Stowe, king Henry gave to the duke\nof Burgundy on this occasion was deserving of more attention than he\nwas disposed to pay to it. \u2018The duke of Burgoyne, desiring the king\u2019s\naid against the duke of Orliance, promised many things,--amongst the\nwhich he promised his daughter in marriage to the prince, and a great\nsum of gold with her. To whom the king answered: \u2018We advertise you not\nto fight with your enemie in this case, who justly seemeth to vexe\nyou, for the death of his father by you procured, but as much as in\nyou lyeth endeavor yourself to mitigate the young man\u2019s wrath, and\npromise to make him reasonable satisfaction, according to the advice\nof your friends; and if then he will not cease from persecuting you,\nget you into the strongest place of your dominion, and there gather\nsuch power as may be able to put off his force. If then, after this,\nhe will make war against you, you shall have the juster occasion to\nfight with him,--and in such case we will shew you such favour as yee\nhave demaunded.\u2019 Thus there were sent over to his ayde Thomas earl of\nArundell, Gilbert Umfreville earl of Angus, or earl of Kyme, sir Robert\nUmfreville, sir John Oldcastle, lord Cobham, sir John Grey and William\nPorter, with twelve hundred archers,\u2019 &c. &c.\n\n[74] According to the catalogue in Moreri, Arnauld de Corbie, lord of\nJoigny, was at this time chancellor.\n\n[75] Called William Porter by Stowe.\n\n[76] Q. If this is not _Umfreville_ earl of Angus and _Kyme_ (as Stowe\ncalls him)? There was at this period no Neville earl of Kent. The\nonly earl of Kent of that family was William Nevil lord Falconbridge,\ncreated 1461. I find this conjecture somewhat confirmed by the\noriginal, which is, \u2018Ousieville comte de Kam.\u2019 It is true, that\nHolinshed mentions the earls of Pembroke and of _Kent_ as being of the\nexpedition: but he cites Monstrelet as his authority, and is therefore\nlikely to be mistaken.\n\n[77] \u2018Que _\u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s_ elle _ne_ mourast de deuil.\u2019 \u2018That she was\nwithin a little of dying with grief.\u2019 Mary of Berry, daughter of John\nduke of Berry, and wife to John duke of Bourbon (her third husband, she\nhaving been before twice a widow, first of Louis de Ch\u00e2tillon count\nof Dunois, and, secondly, of the constable d\u2019Eu), lived till the year\n1434, when she died at Lyons. See Morery. Her children by the duke of\nBourbon were Charles, duke of Bourbon after his father,--Louis, who\ndied young,--and another Louis, founder of the line of Montpensier.\n\n[78] John II. lord of Rieux and Rochefort. According to Morery\u2019s\ncatalogue, two mareschals were created this year,--Louis lord of\nLoigny, and James lord of Heilly, commonly called Mareschal of\nAcquitaine.\n\n[79] See p. 328.\n\n\n[Transcriber's Note:\n\nInconsistent spelling and hyphenation are as in the original.\n\nSeven instances of \u201cPier-vves\u201d changed to read \u201cPier-Yves\u201d; and one\ninstance of \u201cPierre-vves\u201d changed to read \u201cPierre-Yves.\u201d]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Chronicles of Enguerrand de\nMonstrelet, Volume 2 (of 13), by Enguerrand de Monstrelet\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK CHRONICLES--ENGUERRAND MONSTRELET, VOL 2 ***\n\n***** This file should be named 52607-0.txt or 52607-0.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/5/2/6/0/52607/\n\nProduced by Wayne Hammond and The Online Distributed\nProofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net (This file was\nproduced from images generously made available by The\nInternet Archive)\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will\nbe renamed.\n\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United\nStates without permission and without paying copyright\nroyalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\nfrom people in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at\nwww.gutenberg.org\n\n\n\nSection 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by\nU.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\n\nThe Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the\nmailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its\nvolunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous\nlocations.

Newby\n    Chief Executive and Director\n    gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\nSection 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\n\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\nvolunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\nedition.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n\n"}
